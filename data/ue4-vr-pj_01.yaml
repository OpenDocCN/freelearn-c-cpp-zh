    its most basic level, is a medium that immerses users into a simulated world,
    allowing them to see, hear, and interact with an environment and things within
    this environment that don't actually exist in the physical world around them.
    Users are fully surrounded by this experience, an effect that VR developers call
    *immersion*. Users who are immersed in a space can look around and often move
    and interact without ever breaking the illusion that they're actually there. Immersion,
    as we're going to see shortly, is fundamental to the way VR works.

    in this book, is through the use of a **Head-Mounted Display** (**HMD**), often
    just referred to as a **headset**. (There are other ways of doing VR—projecting
    images on walls, for example, but in this book, we focus on head-mounted VR.)
    The user's headset displays the virtual world and tracks the movement of their
    head to rotate and shift the view to create the illusion that they're actually
    looking around and moving through physical space. Some headsets, though not all
    of them, include headphones to add to the illusion by enabling sounds in the environment
    to sound as though they're coming from their sources in the virtual world through
    a process called **spatialized audio**.

    tilting forward (**pitch**), or turning sideways (**yaw**). Up until recently,
    all mobile VR headsets were 3DoF devices, as they used **Inertial Measurement
    Units** (**IMUs**) similar to those found in cellphones to detect rotation, but

    position in space requires you to have a fixed reference point from which you
    can describe its motion. Most first-generation systems needed additional hardware
    for this. The Lighthouse base stations for the HTC Vive, or the Constellation
    cameras for the Oculus Rift provide this postional tracking on desktop systems.
    Windows Mixed Reality headsets and standalone headsets such as the Oculus Quest

    hardware and are almost certainly going to go away as the technology advances.
    Users can feel the headset on their face, for example, and on wired headsets,
    they can feel the cable running from the headset. The current generation of headsets
    offers a field of view that's too narrow to provide peripheral vision. (The desktop
    devices offer a 110° field of view, but your eyes, meanwhile, can perceive a field
    twice as wide.) Display resolutions aren't yet high enough to keep users from
    being able to see individual pixels (VR users call this the **screen door** effect),
    and finicky optics can blur the user's vision if they're not perfectly aligned.
    This means, in practice, that it's hard to read small text on a VR headset, and

    to get back into the *sweet spot* for the lenses.

    a different image to each eye for true stereo depth. (We'll learn how to do this

    In the current generation of VR hardware, haptics take the form of a rumble pack

    the user performing an action, such as turning their head, and seeing the visual

    and world lags behind, it won't feel real, and worse, can make them sick. Current

    a place, and this is, in large part, a phenomenon perceived physically. Very often,
    they respond physically and instinctively to things in the world such as heights
    or objects flying toward them. The body largely believes what it perceives in

    by trying to simulate an environment accurately as it does by triggering and fooling
    a range of systems that we use to perceive the world. This is one of the reasons
    why we can get away with low detail in our textures if we get the movement of
    the world right and keep latency low—our perceptive systems are much more aware
    of motion than detail. VR doesn't have to fool all the senses—just the right ones

    there's a high likelihood that your users are going to lose their balance. If
    you've designed an experience that involves big physical movements, such as swinging
    a sword or a baseball bat, be aware that your users can't see what's around them

    latency will pull the user right out of immersion, and this is a leading trigger
    for simulator sickness. Consider the work you're asking the renderer to do in
    VR, and you'll see that this is going to be a bit of a challenge. The HTC Vive
    Pro displays a 2,880 x 1,600 image (1,400 x 1,600 per eye), while the original
    Vive and the Oculus Rift display 2,160 x 1,200 (1,080 x 1,200 per eye), and all
    of them require this to happen 90 times per second, leaving the renderer 11 milliseconds
    to prepare the frame. The Oculus Go displays 2,560 x 1,440 pixels (1,280 x 1,440
    per eye) 72 times per second, meaning the renderer has about 13 milliseconds to
    deliver the frame. The Unreal Engine renderer is blazingly fast, but, even so,
    this is a lot to render, and there is not a lot of time in which to get the frame
    drawn. You're going to have to make some compromises to reach your target. We'll

    x 1,440），意味着渲染器大约有13毫秒的时间来呈现每一帧。虚幻引擎的渲染速度非常快，但即便如此，这仍然是一个很大的渲染量，而且时间非常有限。你需要做出一些妥协来达到你的目标。我们将在本书中讨论如何做到这一点。

    altogether. (Oculus calls this process **Asynchronous Time Warp** (**ATW**), and
    on the Vive it's called **Asynchronous Reprojection**.) Don't use time warp or

    lot of work, as developers discover things that need to change and have to throw

    a few things you hadn't anticipated, and this is the time to discover these things
    and change what you need. Once you've gone through this process, discovered what
    really works and what doesn't, and adjusted your design to respond to what you
    learned, now you're ready to begin putting expensive art and polish into the work.

  zh: 浏览一下这个清单——哪些是重要的任务，哪些是重大风险？你能够在你拥有的时间和资源内完成所有这些吗？如果范围开始看起来太大，你需要重新评估吗？请记住，做好少数事情通常比试图做所有事情并且做得不好要好得多。在这个阶段，发现项目范围超出你实际能够做好的范围是很常见的，这是一件好事。现在发现这一点的时机是最好的，因为它还只是纸上的计划，你可以重新组织工作，将项目从MVP中移除，或者改变你的进度或资源。如果你在开始阶段发现这些问题，你有机会解决它们，而如果你在软件开发进行了几个月后才发现这些问题，你可能会发现自己陷入了困境。在你还有灵活性的时候，通过纸上的计划为自己的成功做好准备。

- en: Some items in your breakdown will be easier to do than others, and some will
    be more fun. Use your judgement when you figure out the order in which you should
    do things. In general, it's a good idea to tackle the risky things first. If something's
    important enough to be in your MVP, and there's a risk that it could go long,
    or might not work at all, it's often smart to get it out of the way early. Doing
    this gives you time to iterate on a risky item while you work on other things,
    or in the worst-case scenario, if you discover that a thing you'd counted on just
    can't be done, you're still early enough in your project that you may be able
    to fall back to another plan. Don't leave high-risk, high-priority items to the
    end—you'll be in trouble if something goes wrong.

  zh: 拆解清单中的一些项目会比其他项目更容易完成，也会更有趣。当你确定应该按照什么顺序做事情时，要根据自己的判断。一般来说，先解决风险较高的事情是个好主意。如果某个事情足够重要，存在着可能会延期或根本无法完成的风险，通常最好是尽早解决它。这样做可以让你有时间在处理其他事情的同时迭代一个风险项目，或者在最坏的情况下，如果你发现一个你依赖的事情无法完成，你仍然处于项目的早期阶段，你可能能够退回到另一个计划。不要把高风险、高优先级的事情留到最后，如果出现问题，你会陷入困境。
- en: Look for dependencies between items. If something can't be done before another
    thing is done—a character, for example, that can't be animated until the character
    is built and rigged, then make sure those dependencies factor into your plan.
    It does you no good to plan to do a thing in a certain order and then discover
    that you can't because something it depends on isn't ready.

  zh: 寻找项目之间的依赖关系。如果某件事在另一件事之前无法完成——例如，一个角色在构建和装配之前无法进行动画，那么确保这些依赖关系纳入你的计划中。计划按照一定的顺序进行事情是没有好处的，如果发现某个事情所依赖的东西还没有准备好，你就无法按照计划进行。
- en: As you plan how you're going to get through your breakdown, look for items that
    involve risks or uncertainties, items that are just going to take a long time,
    and items that depend on other items. Factor these into your plan. In general,
    where you can, do your high-importance, high-risk work early in your project so
    you have time to handle things if something goes wrong.

- en: 'A word about project management—there''s a forest of literature out there about
    planning and tracking projects, and discussing them in depth falls outside the
    scope of this book. Broadly, these fall into two major schools of thought: **waterfall** and
    **agile**. Waterfall project management methods lay out tasks in a rigid order
    that assumes that, once one task is done, the next can begin. This works well
    when the things you''re doing are well-defined and don''t entail much risk, such
    as painting a house, but VR design and development rarely works out like this.
    You simply may not know whether a feature is *done* until you see it running alongside
    other systems, and you may have to loop back at that point and change something
    or rework it entirely. Agile methods, such as **Scrum**, take this reality into
    account, and are intended for design and development projects where things are
    going to need to be revisited as the project evolves and reveals new information.
    In general, agile methods work much better for software development than waterfall
    plans.'

  zh: 关于项目管理的一点说明——关于规划和跟踪项目的文献很多，深入讨论超出了本书的范围。广义上来说，这些可以分为两个主要的思维流派：瀑布式和敏捷式。瀑布式项目管理方法按照一定的顺序列出任务，假设一项任务完成后，下一项任务就可以开始。这在做事情明确定义且风险不大的情况下效果很好，比如粉刷房子，但VR设计和开发很少能按照这种方式进行。你可能根本不知道一个功能是否完成，直到你看到它与其他系统一起运行，然后你可能需要回头改变或完全重做一些东西。敏捷方法，比如Scrum，考虑到了这一现实，并适用于设计和开发项目，因为在项目发展过程中会需要重新审视并获得新的信息。总的来说，敏捷方法在软件开发方面比瀑布计划更有效。
- en: Depending on the scope of the project, you may not need to apply a formal project
    management method, but even if you're planning loosely, there should still be
    a plan, and you should make sure the plan accommodates the reality that you're
    going to have to loop back and iterate on features and design, that some items
    are going to depend on others, and that some things are going to take longer than
    you thought.

  zh: 在本章中，我们探讨了VR是什么以及它在现实世界中的一些应用方式。我们对沉浸感和存在感进行了相当多的讨论。让我们在这里简要回顾一下。
- en: '*Presence*, we said, is a physiological sensation of *being* in a place, and
    is really the point of VR. We create VR to create presence. Immersion is the means
    by which presence is brought about, and involves taking over the user''s senses
    completely enough that they can begin to believe the virtual world around them.'

  zh: 我们说过，*存在感*是一种生理上的感觉，即*存在于某个地方*，这实际上是VR的目的。我们创造VR是为了创造存在感。沉浸感是实现存在感的手段，它涉及完全占据用户的感官，以至于他们开始相信周围的虚拟世界。
- en: We discussed a number of currently-held best practices for creating good VR.
    The most important of these was the need to keep latency as low as possible and
    the need to be very careful of how you move the user's viewpoint. Simulator sickness
    is largely caused by conflicts between a visual sense of motion and the lack of
    motion felt by the inner ear. Breaking up movement and being aware of the types
    of movement most likely to trigger simulator sickness are important for keeping
    your users comfortable in your experience. We also talked about safety—the need
    to be conscious of the kinds of movement you're asking your users to perform,
    about designing to avoid eyestrain, and the need to be careful about triggering
    photosensitive seizures.
