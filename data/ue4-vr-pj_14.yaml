    If you practice the art of effective searching and take note of a few useful starting
    places for your search, you're going to accelerate your learning enormously. Software
    development changes extremely quickly, and cutting-edge software development such
    as real-time VR changes even more so. The time you spend learning how to search
    for information effectively will serve you forever.

    The secret to finding this stuff are the *Live Training* videos on the Unreal

- en: We began this book by advising you to question any accepted wisdom about VR,
    and we want to repeat that here. Remember that the earliest surviving motion picture
    was made in 1888, and it wasn't until 1925 that Sergei Eisenstein really figured
    out the language of film editing. It took thirty-seven years to figure out one
    of the most fundamental aspects of the genre. *Citizen Kane* came sixteen years
    after that. Please remember this when somebody tells you what you can't do in
    VR. We haven't got the faintest inkling of a clue what the limits of this medium
    are. Dive in and play with it. You're working on a frontier. Don't be afraid to
    try weird things you think might not work. This is how discoveries are made.

- en: 'A quick word about the occasional bloggers who will crop up in your feed declaring
    VR *dead* because it hasn''t yet erupted into a mass medium in the space of two
    years: that''s not how new means of communication propagate through society. It
    took almost three decades for cellular phones to become common consumer devices
    and longer for personal computers. This is no different. At the time of this writing,
    we''re still on the first generation of consumer VR headsets, with heavy lenses
    and wires, narrow fields of view, and external sensors. (On the morning this paragraph
    was written, Oculus announced its first desktop headset with inside-out tracking.)
    We''re very, very early in the development of this hardware, with a lot of technical
    challenges still to overcome, but it''s evident to anyone really paying attention
    that they are going to be overcome. We have no way of knowing whether, when you
    read this, we''ll be in another *VR is dead* phase or another VR gold rush, or
    hopefully somewhere in the middle, but think about this from a standpoint of reality.
    When XR headsets are as comfortable to wear as glasses, don''t require wires,
    have batteries that can last all day, and can offer immersive fields of view,
    we''ll all be using them. This medium isn''t going away. Work in it because you
    love it.'
