    (**VR**). VR is one of the hottest trends in gaming right now, along with **Augmented
    Reality** (**AR**), which will be covered later in this chapter. And thanks to
    such innovations as the ultra-cheap Google Cardboard and similar devices that
    let you view basic VR on recent smartphones, it's pretty easy to get access to
    VR technology.

    such as the Oculus Rift or HTC VIVE, UE4 makes it easy to program for VR. Of course,
    if you have the PlayStation VR, you would need to become an official Sony developer
    to program for that (just like if you were programming anything else for PlayStation),

- en: You may notice that many VR games don't have the player move around within the
    game much, if at all, or have them sitting in a moving vehicle. This is another
    way of avoiding simulation sickness. It's the movement that is the biggest problem,
    particularly vertical movements such as jumping, or rotating by controller instead
    of just turning your head. Basically, your mind thinks you're moving, but your
    body gets conflicting messages because it's not feeling the movement. If you think
    you're sitting in a car, your body doesn't expect to feel movement, so that's
    why it seems to work better. Although, if the player is standing while playing,
    they are likely to have less problems.

  zh: 您可能会注意到许多VR游戏在游戏中几乎不让玩家移动，或者让他们坐在移动的车辆中。这是避免模拟晕动病的另一种方式。移动是最大的问题，特别是垂直移动，比如跳跃，或者通过控制器旋转而不是只转动头部。基本上，您的大脑认为您在移动，但您的身体得到了矛盾的信息，因为它没有感受到移动。如果您认为自己坐在车上，您的身体就不会期望感受到移动，所以这就是为什么它似乎效果更好。尽管如此，如果玩家在玩游戏时站着，他们可能会遇到更少的问题。

  zh: 过程式编程可以让您通过代码中的规则和算法创建游戏的部分，无论是环境、关卡，甚至是音频。基本上，代码会为您设置每一个细节，而不是由人类设置。
- en: The results can be unpredictable, especially in 3D, which is a lot more complicated
    than drawing out rooms and pathways in 2D text characters. Because of this, sometimes,
    the procedural levels are created ahead of time, so the designer can choose the
    ones they like before adding them to the game.

  zh: 结果可能是不可预测的，特别是在3D中，这比在2D文本字符中绘制房间和路径要复杂得多。因此，有时，过程级别是提前创建的，以便设计人员可以在将它们添加到游戏之前选择他们喜欢的级别。
- en: There are many different techniques that help with procedural programming. One
    is the use of **volumetric pixels** (**voxels**), which let you refer to points
    in 3D space in a simple way, based on their relation to other voxels. Voxels have
    been used in many projects, including the now defunct game Landmark (which I worked
    on), and were supposed to be used in the now canceled EverQuest Next. UE4 supports
    voxels through plugins, such as Voxel Plugin ([https://voxelplugin.com/](https://voxelplugin.com/)).

  zh: 有许多不同的技术可以帮助进行过程式编程。其中之一是使用**体素**，它可以让您以一种简单的方式引用3D空间中的点，基于它们与其他体素的关系。体素已经在许多项目中使用，包括现在已经停止运营的游戏Landmark（我曾参与其中），并且原本计划在现在取消的EverQuest
    Next中使用。UE4通过插件支持体素，例如Voxel Plugin（[https://voxelplugin.com/](https://voxelplugin.com/)）。
- en: Procedural programming can also be used for music. There are projects that have
    trained neural networks on specific types of music and come up with some pretty
    impressive music in similar style. You can also modify the music that plays based
    on what is happening in the game. Spore did some very impressive things with this.

- en: Many AAA game studios use UE4, so it definitely supports all the major game
    consoles (Xbox One, PS4, Switch, and even mobile consoles such as the 3DS and
    Vita). The trick to those is you can't usually just develop for them—you need
    to become an authorized developer and usually need to spend a lot of money on
    a DevKit (a specialized version of the console meant for development, that lets
    you debug on the console).
