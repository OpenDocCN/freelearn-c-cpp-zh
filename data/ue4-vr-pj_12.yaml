- en: By reaching this point, you've done more than many aspiring developers ever
    will, and that's no small achievement. The most valuable asset you can cultivate
    in your journey as a VR creator is your persistence and your willingness to do
    the work. By finishing this book, you've already shown dedication and a desire
    to see things through that will set you apart from the rest. Take a moment to
    recognize this quality in yourself.

  zh: 通过达到这一点，你已经做到了许多有抱负的开发者从未做到的事情，这是一项了不起的成就。作为VR创作者，你可以培养的最有价值的资产就是你的坚持和愿意付出努力的态度。通过完成这本书，你已经展示了对事业的奉献和渴望，这将使你与众不同。请花一点时间认识到自己身上的这种品质。
- en: You've probably spotted by now that our focus in writing this book differed
    from that of a lot of other tutorials. There's no shortage of material out there
    that will tell you what buttons to push, but here's the thing—knowing those things
    isn't how you become a good developer. You get good at this by learning how to
    think about the challenges you're trying to solve and how you can use the tools
    you have to solve them. To this end, we digressed multiple times into discussions
    of why something works the way it does or how else it could be used. Continue
    this thinking as you continue your own self-education. Taking the time to learn
    *why* will carry you much further than simply learning *what*. The latter could
    change with the next software update and usually won't apply to anything else.
    The underlying reasons we do things tend not to change. Train yourself to recognize
    that, to know a thing, you have to be able to describe why it is the way it is.
    We've tried throughout the course of this book to get you used to thinking about
    these *why* questions and to give you a number of tools to make more of these
    distinctions yourself.

  zh: 你可能已经注意到，我们在写这本书时的重点与许多其他教程不同。有很多材料可以告诉你应该按哪些按钮，但是这里有一点-知道这些东西并不能让你成为一个好的开发者。你通过学习如何思考你试图解决的挑战以及如何使用你手头的工具来解决它们而变得擅长。为此，我们多次偏离讨论为什么某件事情的工作方式或者它还可以如何使用。在继续自我教育的过程中继续思考这个问题。花时间学习“为什么”将使你走得更远，而不仅仅是学习“什么”。后者可能会随着下一个软件更新而改变，并且通常不适用于其他任何事情。我们做事情的根本原因往往不会改变。训练自己认识到这一点，要知道一件事，你必须能够描述为什么它是这样的。在本书的过程中，我们试图让你习惯思考这些“为什么”的问题，并为你提供一些工具，让你自己更好地区分这些问题。

    truth: **development is iterative**. Many of the examples we did together involved
    solving problems and changing our solutions as we discovered new problems or better
    ways of doing things. We tried, in doing this, to recreate the way developers
    really think as we solve problems. It''s a process that happens one step at a
    time. By focusing on the next steps, doing whatever work is required to do the
    next step, and not giving up or surrendering to discouragement when it''s not
    clear what those next steps should be, you can create nearly anything you imagine.'

  zh: 在本书的过程中，我们还试图展示另一个重要的真理：开发是迭代的。我们一起做的许多例子都涉及解决问题并在发现新问题或更好的解决方法时改变我们的解决方案。我们试图通过这样做来重现开发者解决问题时的真实思维方式。这是一个逐步进行的过程。通过专注于下一步，做好完成下一步所需的工作，并在不清楚下一步应该是什么时不放弃或沮丧，你可以创造几乎任何你想象的东西。
- en: You will find yourself constantly asking yourself why you saw the results you
    did, or why a problem you need to fix might be happening. Becoming an effective
    developer isn't a matter of memorizing a lot of things—it's a matter of building
    effective ways of thinking so you can find your way through the problems you need

- en: In the years immediately following the release of the Oculus Rift and the HTC
    Vive, there was a flurry of activity and interest around VR, and then as the years
    wore on, that interest leveled out. Many people brought out their VR headsets
    for parties or demos and then put them away again—why?

  id: totrans-13

  zh: 好吧，这是因为几个原因。
- en: The first was a question of technology, and here we need to be honest with ourselves
    that this is first-generation tech. What's actually going on to make these headsets
    work is astonishing, but they have limitations. This first generation of the technology
    was too expensive and too difficult to set up for mainstream consumers. The headsets
    weren't comfortable to wear for long periods of time, and the limitations of the
    lenses and the screens combined to break presence by reminding users of the technology
    they were using. Fields of view were narrow, lenses blurred the image if they
    were even a little bit misaligned, and low-screen resolutions left pixel boundaries
    visible (the dreaded *screen door* effect). The hardware developers knew this,
    but they also knew that the only way past the growing pains of a newly-emerging
    technology is to work through them.

  zh: 首先是技术问题，我们需要对自己诚实，这是第一代技术。使这些头戴式显示器工作的实际情况令人惊讶，但它们有局限性。这项技术的第一代对于主流消费者来说过于昂贵和难以设置。长时间佩戴头戴式显示器不舒适，镜片和屏幕的限制使用户意识到他们使用的技术。视野狭窄，镜片稍微错位就会模糊图像，低分辨率的屏幕会显示像素边界（可怕的“屏幕门”效应）。硬件开发人员知道这一点，但他们也知道，克服新兴技术的成长痛苦的唯一方法就是逐步解决问题。
- en: Think ahead a few years and you can see how these problems start going away
    in a big hurry. Screen resolutions are only going to keep improving, even as the
    screens get lighter and require less power. Optical waveguides are likely to replace
    the heavy Fresnel lenses we're using now and dramatically lighten the headsets
    and widen their field of view. External sensors are soon going to be a thing of
    the past, so setting up your VR headset won't require you to chew up three USB
    ports or mount base stations on your walls. Increasingly good standalone headsets
    and PC-based headsets that can communicate wirelessly with their base PCs will
    soon become the norm. These are very solvable problems, and it's reasonable to
    expect that they won't be significant concerns soon.

  zh: 展望几年后，你会看到这些问题迅速消失。屏幕分辨率只会不断提高，同时屏幕变得更轻，需要更少的功率。光学波导很可能取代我们现在使用的笨重的菲涅尔透镜，大大减轻头戴式显示器的重量，并扩大其视野。外部传感器很快将成为过去，因此设置VR头戴式显示器不再需要占用三个USB端口或在墙上安装基站。越来越好的独立头戴式显示器和可以无线与基础PC通信的PC头戴式显示器很快将成为常态。这些都是可以解决的问题，合理地期望它们很快不再是重要问题。
- en: 'Then there''s the question of simulator sickness. In the early years of the
    VR gold rush, developers tended to be utterly naive about this, or they became
    paranoid. Usually, the latter came as a response to the former. We all got our
    original DK1s and DK2s and immediately started making locomotion schemes just
    as we had on the flat screen, and we made ourselves sick. So, then we swung the
    pendulum in the other direction and teleported everywhere. Neither extreme is
    how it has to be. We''re learning more about what we can do to move the player''s
    view that works, and we encourage you to experiment with this as well. There are
    solutions that can work. The other reality is that people become acclimated to
    simulators, just as they do to being on a boat at sea. In the early 1990s, it
    was common for first-person shooters to induce motion sickness too. That doesn''t
    happen anymore, in part because the rendering tech improved, but also in part
    because players got used to them. A similar effect is happening with VR. Be conscious
    of simulator sickness and design your software to mitigate the effect, but don''t
    live in mortal fear of it: explore. Figure out what else can work. Early filmmakers
    had to figure out how they could get away with moving the camera and what cuts
    would work. This is the same thing. We''ll solve this challenge through experimentation.
    Frontiers aren''t places to be bound by rules. We don''t know them yet.'

  zh: 然后是模拟器晕动病的问题。在VR淘金热的早期，开发人员对此通常非常天真，或者变得偏执。通常，后者是对前者的回应。我们都拿到了我们的原始DK1和DK2，并立即开始制定与平面屏幕上相同的运动方案，结果让我们感到不适。然后我们把摆锤摆向了另一个方向，到处传送。两个极端都不是必然的。我们正在了解更多关于如何移动玩家视角的方法，并鼓励您也进行实验。有解决方案可以奏效。另一个现实是，人们会适应模拟器，就像他们适应在海上船上一样。在20世纪90年代初，第一人称射击游戏也会引起晕动病。现在不再发生这种情况，部分原因是渲染技术改进了，但也部分原因是玩家习惯了。VR也正在发生类似的效应。要意识到模拟器晕动病，并设计软件来减轻其影响，但不要过于恐惧：探索。找出其他可能奏效的方法。早期电影制片人必须弄清楚他们如何摆脱摄像机移动的限制，以及哪些剪辑会奏效。这是同样的情况。我们将通过实验来解决这个挑战。前沿不是受规则束缚的地方。我们还不了解它们。

- en: In the gold rush that followed the first release of the Rift and the Vive, developers
    for the most part treated this medium as an updated version of whatever medium
    they already knew. Movie people saw this as a 3D movie device. Games people saw
    it as an immersive gaming device. Neither really had it right.

  zh: 在Rift和Vive首次发布后的淘金热潮中，大多数开发人员将这个媒介视为他们已经了解的媒介的升级版。电影人将其视为3D电影设备，游戏人将其视为沉浸式游戏设备。两者都没有完全正确。
- en: 'The language of this medium is mostly undiscovered, and that makes this an
    exciting place to play. We''ve advised you a few times to question those who try
    to tell you what you can''t do in VR, and here we want to take this a step further.
    Break those boundaries on purpose. Try things you know aren''t going to work,
    because one time in a hundred, they just might. Put active thought and imagination
    into the work you do in exploring VR. Let the medium show you how it works. We
    firmly believe that VR or some variant of it will be the defining medium of the
    21^(st) century. If you really think it through, it''s hard to argue convincingly
    any other way. The benefits of immersion and presence are just too pronounced.
    But we need to figure out how these things really work. We know a few of the basics,
    but we are far from knowing the whole. Early film viewers watching the Lumière
    brothers'' films of trains pulling into stations would have been hard-pressed
    to imagine anything even remotely approaching what films ultimately evolved into.
    Accept that this is the case here too. We''ve only begun to learn what we can
    do with this medium, and only barely begun to figure out how we can do it. The
    most exciting parts of this exploration lie ahead of us. Take a look at the following
