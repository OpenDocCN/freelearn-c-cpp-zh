It is an open source project with an ever-increasing number of contributors. Every programmer comes across a compiler at some point or the other while programming. Simply speaking, a compiler converts a high-level language to machine-executable code. However, what goes on under the hood is a lot of complex algorithms at work. So, to get started with compiler, LLVM will be the simplest infrastructure to study. Written in object-oriented C++, modular in design, and with concepts that are very easy to map to theory, LLVM proves to be attractive for experienced compiler programmers and for novice students who are willing to learn.</p><p class="calibre7">As authors, we maintain that simple solutions frequently work better and are easier to grasp than complex solutions. Throughout the book we will look at various topics that will help you enhance your skills and drive you to learn more.</p><p class="calibre7">We also believe that this book will be helpful for people not directly involved in compiler development as knowledge of compiler development will help them write code optimally.</p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div></div></div>

<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 1. Playing with LLVM" href="part0014_split_000.html#DB7S1-684481f6e3394b1e8596d1aa3001290f">Chapter 1</a>, <em class="calibre8">Playing with LLVM</em>, introduces you to the modular design of LLVM and LLVM Intermediate Representation. In this chapter, we also look into some of the tools that LLVM provides.</p><p class="calibre7">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 2. Building LLVM IR" href="part0018_split_000.html#H5A41-684481f6e3394b1e8596d1aa3001290f">Chapter 2</a>, <em class="calibre8">Building LLVM IR</em>, introduces you to some basic function calls provided by the LLVM infrastructure to build LLVM IR. This chapter demonstrates building of modules, functions, basic blocks, condition statements, and loops using LLVM APIs.</p><p class="calibre7">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 3. Advanced LLVM IR" href="part0028_split_000.html#QMFO1-684481f6e3394b1e8596d1aa3001290f">Chapter 3</a>, <em class="calibre8">Advanced LLVM IR</em>, introduces you to some advanced IR paradigms. This chapter explains advanced IR to the readers and shows how LLVM function calls can be used to emit them in the IR.</p><p class="calibre7">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 4. Basic IR Transformations" href="part0035_split_000.html#11C3M1-684481f6e3394b1e8596d1aa3001290f">Chapter 4</a>, <em class="calibre8">Basic IR Transformations</em>, deals with basic transformation optimizations at the IR level using the LLVM optimizer tool opt and the LLVM Pass infrastructure. You will learn how to use the information of one pass in another and then look into Instruction Simplification and Instruction Combining Passes.</p><p class="calibre7">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 5. Advanced IR Block Transformations" href="part0041_split_000.html#173722-684481f6e3394b1e8596d1aa3001290f">Chapter 5</a>, <em class="calibre8">Advanced IR Block Transformations</em>, deals with optimizations at block level on IR. We will discuss various optimizations such as Loop Optimizations, Scalar Evolution, Vectorization, and so on, followed by the summary of this chapter.</p><p class="calibre7">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 6. IR to Selection DAG phase" href="part0046_split_000.html#1BRPS2-684481f6e3394b1e8596d1aa3001290f">Chapter 6</a>, <em class="calibre8">IR to Selection DAG phase</em>, takes you on a journey through the abstract infrastructure of a target-independent code generator. We explore how LLVM IR is converted to Selection DAG and various phases thereafter. It also introduces you to instruction selection, scheduling, register allocation, and so on.</p><p class="calibre7">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 7. Generating Code for Target Architecture" href="part0054_split_000.html#1JFUC2-684481f6e3394b1e8596d1aa3001290f">Chapter 7</a>, <em class="calibre8">Generating Code for Target Architecture</em>, introduces the readers to the tablegen concept. It shows how target architecture specifications such as register sets, instruction sets, calling conventions, and so on can be represented using tablegen, and how the output of tablegen can be used to emit code for a given architecture. This chapter can be used by readers as a reference for bootstrapping a target machine code generator.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03" class="calibre1"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">All you need to work through most of the examples covered in this book is a Linux machine, preferably Ubuntu. You will also need a simple text or code editor, Internet access, and a browser. We recommend installing the meld tool to compare two files; it works well on the Linux platform.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04" class="calibre1"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">This book is intended for those who already know some of the concepts concerning compilers and want to quickly become familiar with LLVM's infrastructure and the rich set of libraries that it provides. Compiler programmers, who are familiar with concepts of compilers and want to indulge in understanding, exploring, and using the LLVM infrastructure in a meaningful way in their work, will find this book useful.</p><p class="calibre7">This book is also for programmers who are not directly involved in compiler projects but are often involved in development phases where they write thousands of lines of code. With knowledge of how compilers work, they will be able to code in an optimal way and improve performance with clean code.</p></div>
