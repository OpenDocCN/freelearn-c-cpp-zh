The system is based on specialized tracks in which you can place keyframes on certain properties of an actor. The <span class="strong"><strong>user interface</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span>) of Matinee<a id="id325" class="indexterm"/> is similar to other nonlinear video editing software, which makes it easier and familiar for video editors.</p><p>In this chapter, we will create a Matinee sequence and learn how we can play it through <span class="strong"><strong>Level Blueprint</strong></span>. So to get started, let's start Unreal Engine 4 and create a new project based on <span class="strong"><strong>Third Person Template</strong></span>.</p><div class="section" title="Creating a new Matinee"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec37"/>Creating a new Matinee</h1></div></div></div><p>To open the Matinee UI, we first need to<a id="id326" class="indexterm"/> create the Matinee asset. You can create a Matinee asset by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Matinee</strong></span> button and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Add Matinee</strong></span> in the level editor toolbar. When you click on it, you might get a warning saying that Undo/Redo data will be reset. This is because, while you are in the Matinee mode, some changes are translated into keyframes and editor needs to clear the undo stack. Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Continue</strong></span> and a new Matinee Actor will be placed in the level and the Matinee editor will open. Let's take a closer look at the Matinee window:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03950_07_01.jpg" alt="Creating a new Matinee"/><div class="caption"><p>Creating new Matinee Actor</p></div></div><p>This is the Matinee Actor icon:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03950_07_02.jpg" alt="Creating a new Matinee"/><div class="caption"><p>Matinee Actor placed in world</p></div></div><p>After creating a new <a id="id327" class="indexterm"/>Matinee Actor, it will automatically open the <span class="strong"><strong>Matinee</strong></span> Window.

Make sure the <span class="strong"><strong>Cube</strong></span> is selected in world<a id="id336" class="indexterm"/> and right-click in the track list area and select <span class="strong"><strong>Add New Empty Group</strong></span>. You will now be prompted to type a name for your group.

This is because, when we created the group, we had the <span class="strong"><strong>Cube</strong></span> selected in world and whatever object you have selected in world will automatically be hooked to the group you create.</p><p>To move the cube in world, we need to add a <span class="strong"><strong>Movement Track</strong></span> to our <span class="strong"><strong>Cube_Movement</strong></span> group. To create this track:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Right-click on our <span class="strong"><strong>Empty Group</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>Cube_Movement</strong></span>).</li><li class="listitem">Select <span class="strong"><strong>Add New </strong></span><a id="id337" class="indexterm"/><span class="strong"><strong>Movement Track</strong></span>.</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03950_07_08.jpg" alt="Manipulating an object"/></div><p>This will add a new movement track to our <span class="strong"><strong>Empty Group</strong></span> and will set the current position of our cube as the first keyframe.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03950_07_09.jpg" alt="Manipulating an object"/><div class="caption"><p>The small triangle in the beginning of the timeline is the keyframe</p></div></div><p>Now, we want the cube to move to the right by some distance and, by the end of this sequence, it should <a id="id338" class="indexterm"/>come back to its default position. So let's scrub the time bar to the middle of the sequence (since the default length is 5 seconds long, we will move the time bar to <span class="strong"><strong>2.5</strong></span>) and go back to <span class="strong"><strong>Viewport</strong></span> editor. There, we select and move the cube by some distance to the right side (<span class="emphasis"><em>Y</em></span> axis) and press <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span>. Note that now Matinee has created a new keyframe for you at the time slot <span class="strong"><strong>2.5</strong></span> and you will see a dotted yellow line that represents the movement path of the cube.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03950_07_10.jpg" alt="Manipulating an object"/></div><p>To set the keyframe at the exact time (for example, precisely at <span class="strong"><strong>2.5</strong></span>) you can left-click on the key frame to select it and then right-click and select <span class="strong"><strong>Set Time</strong></span>. You will now be prompted to enter the new time to set the keyframe. Here, you can type and set <span class="strong"><strong>2.5</strong></span>.</p><p>If you scrub the time bar<a id="id339" class="indexterm"/> now, you will see the cube move from its original position to the new position that we keyframed at time <span class="strong"><strong>2.5</strong></span>. Now, to get the cube back to its original position at the end of the sequence, we can simply copy paste the first keyframe to the end of the sequence. To do so, click on the first keyframe and press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span>+<span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span> to copy it. Then, scrub the time bar to the end of the sequence and press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span>+<span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span> to paste it. The finished Matinee should look like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03950_07_11.jpg" alt="Manipulating an object"/></div><p>If you hit <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> in the toolbar now, you will see the cube move from its original location to the new location and then, by the end of sequence, it will go back to its original location.</p><p>Now that our Matinee is ready, we will see how to play the Matinee in game. What we are going to do is place a trigger box in level and, when our player overlaps it, Matinee will play. When our player <a id="id340" class="indexterm"/>steps out of the trigger box, Matinee will stop.</p><p>To place a trigger box in world, you need to drag it and drop it into the viewport from the <span class="strong"><strong>Modes</strong></span> tab (which is under <span class="strong"><strong>Place</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Volume</strong></span> category). If you don't have the <span class="strong"><strong>Modes</strong></span> tab, then:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Press <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span>+<span class="emphasis"><em>1</em></span> to open it (make sure your viewport is in focus).</li><li class="listitem">In the <span class="strong"><strong>Modes</strong></span> tab, go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Place</strong></span> mode (<span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span>+<span class="emphasis"><em>1</em></span>).</li><li class="listitem">Select the <span class="strong"><strong>Volumes</strong></span> tab.</li><li class="listitem">Drag and drop the <span class="strong"><strong>Trigger Volume</strong></span> box.</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03950_07_12.jpg" alt="Manipulating an object"/></div><p>Once the trigger box is placed in world (feel free to adjust the size of the trigger box), right-click on it and navigate<a id="id341" class="indexterm"/> to <span class="strong"><strong>Add Event</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>OnActorBeginOverlap</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03950_07_13.jpg" alt="Manipulating an object"/></div><p>This will add a new <span class="strong"><strong>Overlap Event</strong></span> for our <span class="strong"><strong>Trigger Volume</strong></span> in <span class="strong"><strong>Level Blueprint</strong></span>. Since we need to stop the Matinee after exiting the trigger, we will right-click again on the <span class="strong"><strong>Trigger Volume</strong></span> and navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Add Event</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>OnActorEndOverlap</strong></span>. We now have two events (<span class="strong"><strong>Begin Overlap</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>End Overlap</strong></span>) in our <span class="strong"><strong>Level Blueprint</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03950_07_14.jpg" alt="Manipulating an object"/></div><p>As you can see, both overlap events give us the actor that is currently overlapping this <span class="strong"><strong>Trigger Volume</strong></span>. We will use this information to play the Matinee only when a character is overlapping. To do so, we <a id="id342" class="indexterm"/>will have to follow this process:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Click and drag from the other Actor pin in the <span class="strong"><strong>OnActorBeginOverlap</strong></span> event.

To do so, select the Matinee icon in world and right-click inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Level Blueprint</strong></span>. From the resulting context window, select <span class="strong"><strong>Create a reference to Matinee Actor</strong></span>. This will add a new node, which is referred to the Matinee Actor in world. From this node, drag a new wire and type <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> and select it.</li><li class="listitem">Connect the output (unnamed) execution pin of the <span class="strong"><strong>Character</strong></span> node to the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> node of Matinee.</li><li class="listitem">To stop the Matinee<a id="id343" class="indexterm"/> when exiting the trigger, you can do the same setup as previously, but instead of the play node, use the <span class="strong"><strong>Stop</strong></span> node.</li></ol></div><p>The final graph should look like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03950_07_15.jpg" alt="Manipulating an object"/></div><p>Now, when you play the game and overlap the trigger, our Matinee will play.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03950_07_16.jpg" alt="Manipulating an object"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Cutscene camera"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec69"/>Cutscene camera</h2></div></div></div><p>Since you have learned how to<a id="id344" class="indexterm"/> create a Matinee and move an object, it is time to learn how to create a simple cut-scene. In this section, we will create a camera that focuses on the cube when Matinee is triggered.</p><p>To create a camera, let's first <a id="id345" class="indexterm"/>position the viewport camera at the right location. In your editor <span class="strong"><strong>Viewport</strong></span>, navigate to the place where you want the Matinee camera to be. In the following screenshot, you can take a look at where I placed the camera:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03950_07_17.jpg" alt="Cutscene camera"/></div><p>After navigating to <a id="id346" class="indexterm"/>your desired location, open the <span class="strong"><strong>Matinee</strong></span> window. On the<a id="id347" class="indexterm"/> toolbar, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span> button (this will prompt you to enter a new group name) to create a camera at your current <span class="strong"><strong>Viewport</strong></span> camera location.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03950_07_18.jpg" alt="Cutscene camera"/></div><p>This will also create a new <span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span> group with two tracks. They are <span class="strong"><strong>Field of View</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>FOV</strong></span>) and <span class="strong"><strong>Movement</strong></span>. Since we don't use the FOV track, you can right-click on it and select <span class="strong"><strong>Delete Track</strong></span>, or simply press <span class="emphasis"><em>Delete</em></span> to remove it from the track list.</p><p>With the <span class="strong"><strong>Movement Track</strong></span> of the camera selected, scrub the time bar to the end of the sequence. Then in the editor <span class="strong"><strong>Viewport</strong></span>, select the camera created by Matinee and move it to a new location. In this example, I moved the camera to the right side and rotated it by 30 degrees. In the following screenshots, you can see the initial location of the camera and the new location at the<a id="id348" class="indexterm"/> end of the sequence.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03950_07_19.jpg" alt="Cutscene camera"/></div><p>This is the new location of the <a id="id349" class="indexterm"/>camera:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03950_07_20.jpg" alt="Cutscene camera"/></div><p>If you play now and trigger the Matinee from the <span class="strong"><strong>Trigger Volume</strong></span> we placed earlier, you will see the<a id="id350" class="indexterm"/> cube moving as usual but you will not see it from the camera perspective. To see it through the<a id="id351" class="indexterm"/> camera we placed now, you need to add a <span class="strong"><strong>Director Track</strong></span> to your Matinee. Let's take a look at what a <span class="strong"><strong>Director Group</strong></span> is.</p><div class="section" title="Director group"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl3sec27"/>Director group</h3></div></div></div><p>Director group serves the<a id="id352" class="indexterm"/> main function of controlling the visual and audio of your Matinee. The important function of this group is to control which camera group is chosen to be seen in the sequence. We use this group to cut between one camera and the next when we have multiple cameras in Matinee.</p><p>To create a new <span class="strong"><strong>Director Group</strong></span>, right-click on the track list and select <span class="strong"><strong>Add New Director Group</strong></span>. A new separate group will be opened on top of all other groups.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03950_07_21.jpg" alt="Director group"/></div><p>Since we only have one camera in this group, we will add that one to our director track. Select the director track and press <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span>. A new pop up will ask you which track to choose, so select <span class="strong"><strong>MyCamera</strong></span> group (this is the group we created using the <span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span> button in Matinee toolbar). The name <span class="strong"><strong>MyCamera</strong></span> was something I chose. A new keyframe will be added to the director track that says <span class="strong"><strong>MyCamera [Shot0010]</strong></span>. This means that whenever this Matinee is played, you will see through the <span class="strong"><strong>MyCamera</strong></span> group. Later, if you add more cameras, you can switch between cameras in <span class="strong"><strong>Director Group</strong></span>.</p><p>The end result should look like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03950_07_22.jpg" alt="Director group"/></div><p>Now, if you play the<a id="id353" class="indexterm"/> Matinee in the game, you will see it through the new <span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span> view.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03950_07_23.jpg" alt="Director group"/></div><p>Sometimes, when cutscenes are played, it's better to disable <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span> movement (so that when the cutscene is active all player inputs, such as moving around, will be disabled) and HUD and all that. To do these, select the<a id="id354" class="indexterm"/> Matinee Actor in world and then in the <span class="strong"><strong>Details</strong></span> panel, you can set the necessary options.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03950_07_24.jpg" alt="Director group"/></div></div></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec38"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>Matinee is a very powerful tool to create in game cinematics. With multiple cameras and other visual/audio effects, you can create good-looking and professional cinematics.
