I asked him "Why don't you read the documentation?". His answer was, "I do not know much and I do not know where to start. Boost is huge; I have no time to read all about it."</p><p>Well, that was a good hint but such a book would be of interest only to beginners. Professionals would find nothing interesting in it unless I added some C++11 stuff and compared the existing Boost libraries with the new C++ standard. </p><p>I could also add answers to common questions that arise in Boost mailing lists but are hard to find or not covered by the documentation. Spice it up with performance notes and we'd get a book that would be interesting to almost everyone.</p><p>This book will take you through a number of clear, practical recipes that will help you to take advantage of some readily available solutions.</p><p><em>Boost C++ Application Development Cookbook</em> starts out teaching the basics of the Boost libraries that are now mostly part of C++11 and leave no chance for memory leaks. Managing resources will become a piece of cake. We'll see what kind of work can be done at compile time and what Boost containers can do. Do you think multithreading is a burden? Not with Boost. Do you think writing portable and fast servers is impossible? You'll be surprised! Compilers and operating systems differ too much? Not with Boost. From manipulating images to graphs, directories, timers, files, and strings – everyone will find an interesting topic.</p><p>You will learn everything needed for the development of high-quality, fast, and portable applications. Write a program once and you can use it on Linux, Windows, Mac OS, and Android operating systems.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Starting to Write Your Application">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Starting to Write Your Application</em>, covers some recipes for everyday use. We'll see how to get configuration options from different sources and what can be cooked up using some of the datatypes introduced by Boost library authors.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Converting Data">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Converting Data</em>, explains how to convert strings, numbers, and user-defined types to each other, how to safely cast polymorphic types, and how to write small and large parsers right in C++ source files.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Managing Resources">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Managing Resources</em>, provides guidance to easily managing resources and how to use a datatype capable of storing any functional objects, functions, and lambda expressions. After reading this chapter your code will become more reliable and memory leaks will become history.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Compile-time Tricks">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Compile-time Tricks</em>, walks you through some basic examples on how Boost libraries can be used in compile-time checking, for tuning algorithms and in other metaprogramming tasks.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Multithreading">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Multithreading</em>, discusses threads and everything connected with them.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Manipulating Tasks">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Manipulating Tasks</em>, explains that we can split all of the processing, computations, and interactions to functors (tasks) and process each of those tasks almost independently. Moreover, we need not block on some slow operations such as receiving data from socket or waiting for timeout, but instead provide a callback task and continue processing other tasks.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Manipulating Strings">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Manipulating Strings</em>, covers different aspects of changing, searching, and representing strings. We'll see how some common string-related tasks can easily be done using Boost libraries.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Metaprogramming">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Metaprogramming</em>, is devoted to some cool and hard-to-understand metaprogramming methods. Those methods are not for everyday use, but they will be a real help for development of generic libraries.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Containers">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Containers</em>, covers Boost containers and everything directly connected to them. This chapter provides information about Boost classes that can be used in everyday programming and that will make your code much faster and development of new applications easier.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Gathering Platform and Compiler Information">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Gathering Platform and Compiler Information</em>, provides different helper macros used to detect compiler, platform, and Boost features. Those macros are widely used across Boost libraries and are essential for writing portable code that is able to work with any compiler flags.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Working with the System">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Working with the System</em>, takes a closer look at the filesystem and at creating and deleting files. We'll see how data can be passed between different system processes, how to read files with maximum speed, and how to do other tricks.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Scratching the Tip of the Iceberg">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Scratching the Tip of the Iceberg</em>, is devoted to some of those big libraries, giving the basics to start with. Some of the Boost libraries are small and meant for everyday use, others require a separate book to describe all of their features.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is great for developers who are new to Boost, and who are looking to improve their knowledge of Boost and see some undocumented details or tricks. It's assumed that you will have some experience in C++ already, as well as being familiar with the basics of STL. A few chapters will require some previous knowledge of multithreading and networking. You are expected to have at least one good C++ compiler and compiled version of Boost (1.53.0 or later is recommended), which will be used during the exercises within this book.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "It means that you can catch almost all Boost exceptions using <code class="literal">catch (const std::exception&amp; e)</code>."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">#include &lt;boost/variant.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

int main()
{
    typedef boost::variant&lt;int, const char*, std::string&gt; my_var_t;
    std::vector&lt;my_var_t&gt; some_values;
    some_values.push_back(10);
    some_values.push_back("Hello there!");
    some_values.push_back(std::string("Wow!"));
    std::string&amp; s = boost::get&lt;std::string&gt;(some_values.back());
    s += " That is great!\n";
    std::cout &lt;&lt; s;
    return 0;
