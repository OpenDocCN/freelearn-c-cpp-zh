    There are other alternatives, such as **Zwoptex** ([http://zwopple.com/zwoptex/](http://zwopple.com/zwoptex/)),
    and they usually offer some features for free. Cocos2d-x now offers a free program
    called **CocosStudio**, which is somewhat similar to **SpriteBuilder** (previously
    **CocosBuilder**), and it offers ways to build sprite sheets, bitmap fonts, as
    well as a number of other goodies. At the time of writing this, the Windows version
    is somewhat superior to the Mac version, but they are free!'

- en: 'A tool to help build particle effects: I''ll use Particle Designer ([http://www.71squared.com/en/particledesigner](http://www.71squared.com/en/particledesigner)).
    Depending on your operating system, you may find free tools online for this. Cocos2d-x
    comes bundled with some common particle effects that you can customize. But doing
    it blindly is a process I do not recommend. CocosStudio also allows you to create
    your own particle effects, but you may find its interface a bit daunting. It certainly
    requires its own book of tutorials!'

- en: 'A tool to help build bitmap fonts: I''ll use Glyph Designer ([http://www.71squared.com/en/glyphdesigner](http://www.71squared.com/en/glyphdesigner)).
    But there are others: bmGlyph (which is not as expensive) and FontBuilder (which
    is free). It is not extremely hard to build a bitmap font—not nearly as hard as
    building a particle effect from scratch—but doing it once is enough to convince
    you to get one of these tools fast. Once again, you might give CocosStudio a go.'

    also learned enough of the structure of a basic Cocos2d-x application to start
    building your first game and you know how to deploy to both iOS and Android.
