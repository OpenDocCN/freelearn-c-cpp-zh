Then, be introduced to PhAT (Physics Asset Tool) within Unreal Engine 4 to learn more about developing physics objects for your game world. Next, dive into Unreal Engine 4's collision generation, physical materials, blueprints, constraints, and more to get hands-on experience with the tools provided by Epic Games to create the effect of the real physical world in Unreal Engine 4. Lastly, you will create a working Vehicle Blueprint that uses all the concepts covered in this book, and also cover topics related to advanced physics.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
