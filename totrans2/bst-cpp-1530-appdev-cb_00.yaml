- en: A few years ago one of my friends was looking for a book about the Boost libraries.
    I asked him "Why don't you read the documentation?". His answer was, "I do not
    know much and I do not know where to start. Boost is huge; I have no time to read
    all about it."
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well, that was a good hint but such a book would be of interest only to beginners.
    Professionals would find nothing interesting in it unless I added some C++11 stuff
    and compared the existing Boost libraries with the new C++ standard.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I could also add answers to common questions that arise in Boost mailing lists
    but are hard to find or not covered by the documentation. Spice it up with performance
    notes and we'd get a book that would be interesting to almost everyone.

- en: '*Boost C++ Application Development Cookbook* starts out teaching the basics
    of the Boost libraries that are now mostly part of C++11 and leave no chance for
    memory leaks. Managing resources will become a piece of cake. We''ll see what
    kind of work can be done at compile time and what Boost containers can do. Do
    you think multithreading is a burden? Not with Boost. Do you think writing portable
    and fast servers is impossible? You''ll be surprised! Compilers and operating
    systems differ too much? Not with Boost. From manipulating images to graphs, directories,
    timers, files, and strings – everyone will find an interesting topic.'

    to Write Your Application*, covers some recipes for everyday use. We''ll see how
    to get configuration options from different sources and what can be cooked up
    using some of the datatypes introduced by Boost library authors.'

    in C++ source files.'

    provides guidance to easily managing resources and how to use a datatype capable

    history.'

    explains that we can split all of the processing, computations, and interactions
    to functors (tasks) and process each of those tasks almost independently. Moreover,
    we need not block on some slow operations such as receiving data from socket or
    waiting for timeout, but instead provide a callback task and continue processing
    other tasks.'

    to improve their knowledge of Boost and see some undocumented details or tricks.
    It's assumed that you will have some experience in C++ already, as well as being
    familiar with the basics of STL. A few chapters will require some previous knowledge
    of multithreading and networking. You are expected to have at least one good C++
    compiler and compiled version of Boost (1.53.0 or later is recommended), which
    will be used during the exercises within this book.
