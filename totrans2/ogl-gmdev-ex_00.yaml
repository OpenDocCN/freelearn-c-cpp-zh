- en: Welcome to *OpenGL Game Development Blueprints*! We are excited that you chose
    this book as your guide to both OpenGL and game development. This section will
    provide you with a brief preview of each chapter, followed by the technologies
    that are required to complete the work that is presented in the book. Finally,
    we will discuss the target audience for this book so that you will know whether
    this book is right for you.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Building the Foundation"), *Building the
    Foundation*, guides you through creating the code framework for the game. Games
    use a particular structure that is known as the *game loop*. By the end of this
    chapter, you will understand and have created the game loop for the game as well
    as initialized the required OpenGL elements.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Your Point of View"), *Your Point of View*,
    introduces you to the first project in the book—creating a 2D platform game. The
    first step in this project will be to define the type of view that is required
    by OpenGL, and render the background of the game.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. A Matter of Character"), *A Matter of Character*,
    covers the creation of sprites that move on the screen. 2D frame-based animations
    are the core of any 2D game, and you will learn how to create simple graphics
    and render them to the screen.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Control Freak"), *Control Freak*, teaches
    you how to build an input system that will allow you to control the main character
    and other aspects of the game. You will also create a basic user interface that
    allows you to start the game and navigate to various options.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Hit and Run"), *Hit and Run*, covers collision
    detection. You will learn how to stop the character from falling through the ground,
    how to land on objects, and how to detect whether enemies have hit you or have
    been hit by player weapons. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to play
    the game for the first time.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Polishing the Silver"), *Polishing the Silver*,
    covers the topics that make a game presentable (but are often overlooked by novice
    developers). You will learn how to implement a scoring system, game over and game
    won scenarios, and simple level progression. This chapter will conclude the 2D
    project of the book.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Audio Adrenaline"), *Audio Adrenaline*, guides
    you through implementing sound effects and music in the game. We will provide
    links to some audio files that you can use in your game.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Expanding Your Horizons"), *Expanding Your
    Horizons*, will start the second project of the book—a 3D first-person space shooter.
    At the end of this chapter you will have created a new project, starting the framework
    for a 3D game.'

- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Super Models"), *Super Models*, introduces
    you to the concepts of 3D art and modeling, and then guides you through the process
    of loading 3D models into the game environment. Although you will be able try
    your hand at creating a 3D model, the resources that are required for the game
    will be provided online.'

    on many of the concepts that were covered in the 2D segment of the book and applies
    them to a 3D world. Movement and collision detection are revamped to take this
    new dimension into consideration. An input scheme to move in 3D space is implemented.
    By the end of this chapter, you will be able to control a 3D model in 3D space.'

- en: '[Chapter 11](ch11.html "Chapter 11. Heads Up"), *Heads Up*, guides you through
    creating a 2D user interface on top of the 3D world. You will create a menu system
    to start and end the game, as well as a heads-up-display (HUD) that shows the
    score and stats in game. By the end of this chapter, you will have created a playable
    3D shooter game.'

    introduces you to some of the more advanced concepts that were beyond the scope
    of the book, and it gives you some direction to advance your skills.'

    exercise is a building block toward creating your first game using OpenGL. It
    is vitally important that you actually write the code. In our experience, you
    can't learn any kind of computer programming without actually writing code. Don't
    just read the book, do the book!

- en: If you are reading this book, it is pretty obvious that you are interested in
    game development. You have either heard of OpenGL or perhaps even used it, and
    you want to learn more. Finally, you are already a programmer in some computer
    language or you want to be.

    the C++ computer language. If you have programmed in some other language, such
    as C#, Java, JavaScript, or PHP, then you are pretty familiar with the constructs
    of the C++ language. Nevertheless, if have never programmed in C++ then you may
    need to brush up on your skills. You can try *Microsoft Visual C++ Windows Applications
    by Example*, also published by *Packt Publishing*. If you feel comfortable with
    programming in general, but have not coded in C++, you can look at the free online
    C++ tutorials at [http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/).

- en: We don't assume that you have any knowledge of OpenGL—that is what this book
    is going to give you. We start by explaining the basic concepts of OpenGL and
    move through more advanced concepts by example. As you learn, you will also code,
    providing you with the opportunity to put what you have learned into practice.
    This book won't make you an OpenGL expert overnight, but it will give you the
    foundation to understand and use OpenGL. At the end of this book, we will give
    you some pointers to other resources that will allow you to learn even more about
    OpenGL.

    is rather unique in that it provides you with a primer to learn OpenGL and a primer
    to learn game development. There are many books out there that teach OpenGL, but
    most do so within a more academic or theoretical framework. We felt that it was
    better to teach you OpenGL while you were using it to create an actual game. Actually,
    you will code two games: one in 2D, and one in 3D. Two for the price of one!'
