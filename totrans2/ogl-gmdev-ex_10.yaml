    there really isn't a camera that you move around in the scene. Instead, the camera
    is always located at coordinates (**0.0, 0.0, 0.0**), or the world's origin. This
    means that our ship will always be located at the origin. Instead of moving the
    ship, we will actually move the other objects in the opposite direction. When
    we turn the ship, we will actually rotate the world in the opposite direction.

    to the cylinder to achieve this.

    Blender exports a model, it exports it as either quads or triangles. The loader

    in `m_primitive`. We then use that to determine whether this particular object
    must be rendered using triangles or quads.

    If we drew every object using these points, then they would all be drawn at the
    origin. You will recall that we want to place each object in the game relative
    to the ship. So, we draw the ship at the origin, and we draw every other object
    in the game based on the position of the ship. We move the universe, not the ship.

    to the collision detection used in RoboRacer2D. We simply added the z dimension
    to the equations.

- en: If the asteroid has collided with the ship, we set `IsCollideable` for the asteroid
    to `false`. This stops the collision from occurring multiple times as the ship
    passes through the asteroid. For our game, we only need to collide with each asteroid
    once, so this is sufficient.

- en: We covered a lot of code in this chapter. You implemented a simple, yet effective
    framework to create and manage 3D objects in the game. This class included necessary
    features to load the model, position the model in 3D space, and check for collisions.

    slalom race, requiring you to navigate through each asteroid.

    make this a more complete game.
