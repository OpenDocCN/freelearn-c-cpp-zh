In this chapter, you will learn how to download Unreal Engine's source version and launcher version. After that, we will get familiar with the Unreal Engine 4 UI and Content Browser.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec08"/>Unreal Engine 4 download</h1></div></div></div><p>Unreal Engine 4 is<a id="id0" class="indexterm"/> completely free (including all future updates!) to download and use. You get all the Unreal Engine tools, free sample contents, complete C++ source code which includes code for the entire editor, and all of its tools; you also get access to official documentation that includes tutorials and support resources, plus you get access to UE4 marketplace, which offers tons of free and commercial content.</p><p>Unreal Engine 4 can be <a id="id1" class="indexterm"/>downloaded in two different versions. One is a binary version (launcher) and the other is the source version (GitHub). The differences between the GitHub and launcher version are as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Launcher (binary) version</strong>: These are<a id="id2" class="indexterm"/> compiled by Epic and are available through launcher. You will also get all source files (<code class="literal">*.cpp</code>) with the launcher version, but you cannot make<a id="id3" class="indexterm"/> any modifications to Unreal Engine since launcher versions do not generate a solution file.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>GitHub version</strong>: These do<a id="id4" class="indexterm"/> not have any binary files so you have to compile the Engine yourself. You get the entire source and<a id="id5" class="indexterm"/> you can modify virtually anything in Unreal Engine. You can add new Engine features, modify existing features or remove them (which no one does), and create a pull request on GitHub so if Epic likes it, they will integrate it officially into Unreal Engine.</li></ul></div><p>In this guide, I'll show you how to get both versions.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec07"/>Downloading the launcher version</h2></div></div></div><p>To download the<a id="id6" class="indexterm"/> launcher version of<a id="id7" class="indexterm"/> Unreal Engine, you obviously need the launcher. To download the launcher, follow these steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">First go<a id="id8" class="indexterm"/> to <a class="ulink" href="https://www.unrealengine.com/">https://www.unrealengine.com/</a> and log in using your credentials.</li><li class="listitem">Once you log in, you can download the launcher by clicking on the big orange <strong>Download</strong> button under <strong>Get Unreal Engine</strong>.<div><img src="img/B03950_01_01.jpg" alt="Downloading the launcher version"/></div></li></ol></div><p>When you open the launcher for the first time after installation, it should automatically download the latest version of Unreal Engine 4. If it doesn't, then go to the <strong>Library</strong> tab and click on <strong>Add Engine</strong>. A new Engine slot will now appear and here, you can select your Unreal Engine version and install it.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_01_02.jpg" alt="Downloading the launcher version"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08"/>Downloading the GitHub version</h2></div></div></div><p>To download the source <a id="id9" class="indexterm"/>of Unreal<a id="id10" class="indexterm"/> Engine 4, follow these steps</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">First create a GitHub account (it's free!).</li><li class="listitem">After that, you need<a id="id11" class="indexterm"/> to go to <a class="ulink" href="https://www.unrealengine.com/dashboard/settings">https://www.unrealengine.com/dashboard/settings</a> and update your GitHub account name and click on <strong>Save</strong>:<div><img src="img/B03950_01_03.jpg" alt="Downloading the GitHub version"/></div></li></ol></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec01"/>Forking Unreal Engine repository</h3></div></div></div><p>After you have <a id="id12" class="indexterm"/>successfully linked your GitHub account with your Unreal Engine account, you need to log in to GitHub and navigate to the Unreal Engine repository.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"/>Note</h3><p>Make sure you have linked your GitHub account to your Unreal Engine account. Otherwise, you will not be able to see the Unreal Engine repository.</p></div></div><p>When you are at the repository page:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>Fork</strong> at the top right of the page.</li><li class="listitem">Select your username to fork it to your GitHub repository.</li><li class="listitem">Then, you need to download GitHub for Windows (if you are on Windows) or GitHub for Mac (if you are on Mac) and install it.</li></ol></div><p>You need this Git client to clone (download) your forked repository, make your own changes to Unreal Engine, and submit the changes as a pull request to Epic to integrate them into the editor.</p><p>To clone your forked repository follow these steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Start GitHub and <a id="id13" class="indexterm"/>log in using your credentials.</li><li class="listitem">Click on the plus (<strong>+</strong>) sign on the top left corner of the Git client.</li><li class="listitem">Then, click on the <strong>Clone</strong> tab and select your <strong>username</strong> (you should now see Unreal Engine).</li><li class="listitem">Now, click on <strong>Clone</strong> Unreal Engine and choose a folder where you want to save your Unreal Engine repository.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">You should now see GitHub cloning Unreal Engine to your hard disk.<div><img src="img/B03950_01_04.jpg" alt="Forking Unreal Engine repository"/></div></li></ol></div><p>Once cloning is complete, navigate to that directory and run the <code class="literal">Setup.bat</code> file.</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">This will download all the necessary files that are needed to compile the engine and will also install all the required prerequisites for the Engine.</li><li class="listitem">This might take <a id="id14" class="indexterm"/>some time depending on your Internet speed because it has to download more than 2 GB of files.</li></ol></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec02"/>Compiling Unreal Engine</h3></div></div></div><p>Once <code class="literal">Setup.bat</code> has finished, run <code class="literal">GenerateProjectFiles.bat</code>, which will generate the Visual Studio <a id="id15" class="indexterm"/>Solution file. Open the <code class="literal">UE4.sln</code> file and now, you are all set to compile your own copy of Unreal Engine 4☺. Now, right-click on UE4 in the <strong>Solution Explorer</strong> and click on <strong>Build</strong>.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_01_05.jpg" alt="Compiling Unreal Engine"/></div><p>This will take from 15 minutes to 1 hour depending on your system hardware. So sit back, grab a cup of coffee, and wait till Engine finishes compiling.</p></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec09"/>Getting familiar with Unreal Engine</h1></div></div></div><p>Once your Engine finishes <a id="id16" class="indexterm"/>compiling (or downloading, if you are using launcher) it's time to start it:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Starting your custom build</strong>: You can either press <em>F5</em> in Visual Studio to start debugging the Engine or navigate to the directory where you downloaded it <a id="id17" class="indexterm"/>and go to <code class="literal">Engine\Binaries\Win64</code> folder and double-click on <code class="literal">UE4Editor.exe</code>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Starting launcher build</strong>: Simply<a id="id18" class="indexterm"/> click on that big <strong>Launch</strong> button and you're good to go.</li></ul></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note03"/>Note</h3><p>You might experience long loading time when you start the Engine for the first time after compiling. This is because Unreal Engine will optimize the contents for your platform to derive data cache. This is a one-time process.</p></div></div><p>After the splash screen, you <a id="id19" class="indexterm"/>should now see the Unreal project browser. Perform the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Select the <strong>New Project</strong> tab, and this is where you create your new projects.</li><li class="listitem">For this book, we will stick with a <strong>Blank Blueprint Project</strong>. So, in the <strong>Blueprint</strong> tab, select <strong>Blank</strong> project.</li><li class="listitem">You can choose which platform you want for your project. There are two platforms available: <strong>Desktop/Console</strong> and <strong>Mobile/Tablet</strong>. Feel free to change this setting for your project. The second setting determines the graphics settings for your platform. If you choose <strong>Desktop/Console</strong>, it's better to stick with <strong>Maximum Quality</strong> and if your project is targeting <strong>Mobile/Tablets</strong>, you should choose scalable 3D or 2D, which is aimed at low-end GPUs. The third and final setting lets you add some <strong>Starter Content</strong> from Epic, which contains some basic meshes, materials, and textures. You can choose not to include <strong>Starter Content</strong> so the project will only contain essential elements for the selected project.</li><li class="listitem">Note that it is not recommended to include <strong>Starter Content</strong> when creating a project for the <strong>Mobile/Tablet</strong> platform. This can significantly increase the package size of your project.</li><li class="listitem">Choose a name for your project and the location where you want to save it.</li><li class="listitem">Finally, click on <strong>Create Project</strong> to start Unreal Engine 4 with your project:<div><img src="img/B03950_01_06.jpg" alt="Getting familiar with Unreal Engine"/></div></li></ol></div><p>This is how the Unreal <a id="id20" class="indexterm"/>Engine user interface looks:</p><div><img src="img/B03950_01_07.jpg" alt="Getting familiar with Unreal Engine"/></div><p>Once Unreal Engine<a id="id21" class="indexterm"/> starts up, you should see a scene similar to the preceding screenshot. This is the scene that will be displayed by default, if you choose to include <strong>Starter Content</strong>. If you skip <strong>Starter Content</strong>, then the startup scene will be different.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec09"/>The viewport toolbar</h2></div></div></div><p>The viewport toolbar contains various tools that<a id="id22" class="indexterm"/> you will use throughout your<a id="id23" class="indexterm"/> level design process. Let's take a quick look at them:</p><div><img src="img/B03950_01_08.jpg" alt="The viewport toolbar"/></div><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Transform Tools</strong>: These three tools are the move tool, the rotate tool, and the scale tool.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Coordinate System</strong>: This allows you to move, rotate, or scale your Actor either on world axes (world space) or on its own local axes (local space). By default, Unreal editor starts in world axes but you can toggle by clicking on the icon. The globe icon<a id="id24" class="indexterm"/> means world space and the cube icon means local space.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Snapping and Move Grid</strong>: Snapping allows you to snap one Actor to another Actor's surface, and<a id="id25" class="indexterm"/> move grid allows you to snap to a three-dimensional implicit grid within the scene.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Rotation Grid</strong>: This provides incremental rotation snaps.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Scale Grid</strong>: This snaps to additive increments.<div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip02"/>Tip</h3><p>Snapping preferences for move, rotate, and scale can be adjusted in <strong>Editor Preferences</strong>. Go to <strong>Edit</strong> | <strong>Editor Preferences</strong> | <strong>Viewports</strong> and then scroll to <strong>Grid Snapping Category</strong>.</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Camera Speed</strong>: This lets you control how fast the camera moves in viewport.<div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip03"/>Tip</h3><p>You can fine-tune the camera speed by holding down the right mouse button (while using <em>WASD</em> controls) and scrolling the mouse wheel up or down to speed up or slow down the camera's movement.</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Maximize Viewport</strong>: This toggles between a single viewport and a 4-view split style.<div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip04"/>Tip</h3><p>You can adjust the layout of <strong>Viewport</strong> by changing the <strong>Layout</strong> option, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/B03950_01_09.jpg" alt="The viewport toolbar"/></div></div></div></li></ul></div><p>Later in this chapter, you will<a id="id26" class="indexterm"/> learn how to use <strong>Binary Space Partitioning (BSP)</strong> and change some project <a id="id27" class="indexterm"/>settings such as <strong>Splash</strong> screen, game <strong>Icon</strong>, and so on.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10"/>Modes</h2></div></div></div><p>The <strong>Modes</strong> tab contains all five <a id="id28" class="indexterm"/>modes of the editor. They are as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Place</strong> mode (shortcut key is <em>Shift</em> + <em>1</em>): <strong>Place</strong> mode allows you to quickly place your<a id="id29" class="indexterm"/> recently placed objects and also Engine primitives such as lights, geometries, triggers, volumes, and so on.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Paint</strong> mode (shortcut key is <em>Shift</em> + <em>2</em>): <strong>Paint</strong> mode (also known as <strong>Mesh Paint</strong>) allows you to interactively paint vertex colors on <strong>Static Mesh</strong> in <strong>Level Viewport</strong>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Landscape</strong> mode (shortcut key is <em>Shift</em> + <em>3</em>): <strong>Landscape</strong> mode lets you create a new landscape entirely in Unreal Editor or import a height map from an external program, such as <strong>World Machine</strong>, <strong>TerreSculptor</strong>, and so on, and make modifications to it.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Foliage</strong> mode (shortcut key is <em>Shift</em> + <em>4</em>): <strong>Foliage</strong> mode allows you to paint or erase multiple static meshes on <strong>Landscapes</strong>, other static meshes, and so on. An example workflow is to paint grass, trees, and so on on a large area.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Geometry Editing</strong> mode (shortcut key is <em>Shift</em> + <em>5</em>): <strong>Geometry</strong> mode allows you to edit BSP brushes.</li></ul></div><div><img src="img/B03950_01_10.jpg" alt="Modes"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec11"/>Content Browser</h2></div></div></div><p>
<strong>Content Browser</strong> is what you call the<a id="id30" class="indexterm"/> heart of your project. This is where you create, import, view, edit, organize, and <a id="id31" class="indexterm"/>modify all the assets for your game. It also lets you rename, delete, copy, and move assets across other folders just like you do in Windows Explorer. Additionally, Content Browser also lets you search for specific assets based on keywords or asset type and you can exclude assets from your search by adding '-' (hyphen) as the prefix.</p><p>You can also create <strong>Collections</strong> to arrange your commonly used assets for quick access.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip05"/>Tip</h3><p>Collections are just references to assets and are not moved into collections. That means a single asset can exist in multiple collections and you can create an unlimited number of collections.</p></div></div><p>There are three types <a id="id32" class="indexterm"/>of collections:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Shared collection</strong>: These are visible to you and to other users. This option is active only if you have <strong>Source </strong><a id="id33" class="indexterm"/><strong>Control</strong> (for example: Perforce, Subversion and so on.) enabled.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Private collection</strong>: These are <a id="id34" class="indexterm"/>visible only to those who are invited to view the collection. This option is active only if you have <strong>Source Control</strong> (for example: Perforce, Subversion and so on.) enabled.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Local collection</strong>: These<a id="id35" class="indexterm"/> are only for you. That means they only exist on your local machine.</li></ul></div><p>If you want to transfer an asset from<a id="id36" class="indexterm"/> one project to another, you can right-click on the asset and choose <strong>Migrate…</strong>, which will copy that asset and all its dependencies to your new project.</p><p>
<strong>Content Browser</strong> can be accessed by pressing <em>Ctrl</em>+<em>Shift</em>+<em>F</em> or from the <strong>Windows</strong> menu on the menu bar. You can also have four instances of <strong>Content Browser</strong> at the same time. </p><p>This can be really useful when you want to move assets to different folders or to preview various assets in different folders.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_01_11.jpg" alt="Content Browser"/></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec03"/>Content Browser view options</h3></div></div></div><p>View options<a id="id37" class="indexterm"/> lets you do the following:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Change the thumbnail size</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Change the view style</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Modify the 3D thumbnail, and more</li></ul></div><p>
<strong>View Options</strong> can<a id="id38" class="indexterm"/> be accessed from the bottom-right corner of <strong>Content Browser</strong>.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_01_12.jpg" alt="Content Browser view options"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec04"/>World outliner</h3></div></div></div><p>
<strong>World Outliner</strong> shows <a id="id39" class="indexterm"/>all the Actors within the level in a tree view. Actors can be selected and modified from world outliner. Right-clicking on an Actor in <strong>World Outliner</strong> will show the same context menu used in <strong>Viewport</strong> so you can modify it without having to navigate to them in <strong>Viewport</strong>. You can drag an Actor to another Actor and attach them together.</p><p>World outliner allows you to search for a specific Actor. You can exclude a specific Actor by adding <strong>- </strong>(hyphen) before the search term and you can force a term to match exactly by adding <strong>+</strong> before the search term.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_01_13.jpg" alt="World outliner"/></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec12"/>Details panel</h2></div></div></div><p>The <strong>Details</strong> panel shows all the information, utilities, and functions specific to the selection in the viewport. It displays all the editable properties for the selected Actor and provides additional functionality <a id="id40" class="indexterm"/>based on the selected Actor. For example, if you select a <strong>Blueprint</strong>, the <strong>Details</strong> panel will show everything related to that Blueprint, that is exposed variables, Blutility events, and so on. If you select a <strong>Static Mesh</strong> actor, the <strong>Details</strong> panel will show which material was applied, the collision<a id="id41" class="indexterm"/> settings, the physics settings, the rendering settings, and more. The <strong>Details</strong> panel can be locked to the selected Actor so it does not change based on Actor selection. Just like <strong>Content Browser</strong>, you can have four instances of <strong>Details</strong> panel open at the same time.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec13"/>Navigating the Viewport</h2></div></div></div><p>You can navigate the viewport easily using the mouse and keyboard. A high-level explanation of <a id="id42" class="indexterm"/>navigating the viewport can be found here: <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Viewports/ViewportControls/index.html">https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Viewports/ViewportControls/index.html</a>
</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip06"/>Tip</h3><p>At the bottom-left corner of<a id="id43" class="indexterm"/> the viewport, there is a small question mark button. If you click on that, you will see some commonly used viewport shortcut keys.</p></div></div><div><img src="img/B03950_01_14_edited.jpg" alt="Navigating the Viewport"/></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec10"/>BSP</h1></div></div></div><p>Now that we have some solid understanding of Engine UI, let's use BSP to create a simple level. BSP is a geometry tool (also known as <strong>Geometry Brush</strong> or simply <strong>Brush</strong>) used for quickly prototyping levels (also known as blocking out levels). Some developers prefer to call this <a id="id44" class="indexterm"/>
<strong>Constructive Solid Geometry</strong> (<strong>CSG</strong>), which is the more accurate term since geometry in Unreal editor is created by adding and subtracting<a id="id45" class="indexterm"/> brushes. BSP has been there since the first release of Unreal. It was used for level designing long ago but later, this role has been passed to static meshes because BSP is more expensive in performance.</p><p>So basically, BSP should only be used to prototype a level. Once you have the basic idea of how a level should look, you should start replacing it with static meshes.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip07"/>Tip</h3><p>CSG and BSP are used interchangeably to refer the geometry in Unreal. Both are the same.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec14"/>Creating BSP</h2></div></div></div><p>Unreal Engine 4 comes <a id="id46" class="indexterm"/>with seven Brushes and all of them can be customized in <strong>Details</strong> panel. They are as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Box</strong>: You can adjust the <em>X</em>, <em>Y</em>, and <em>Z</em> axes and set it to <strong>Hollow</strong>, which is a fast way to make a room, and adjust <strong>Wall Thickness</strong>, which defines the thickness of the inside walls.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Cone</strong>: You can customize the number of sides, height, and both outer and inner radius in <strong>Details</strong> panel. You can also set this to <strong>Hollow</strong> and adjust <strong>Wall Thickness</strong> to define the thickness of the inside walls.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Cylinder</strong>: You can customize the number of sides, height, and both outer and inner radius in <strong>Details</strong> panel. You can also set this to <strong>Hollow</strong> and adjust <strong>Wall Thickness</strong> to define the thickness of the inside walls.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Curved Stair</strong>: This creates a staircase shape that bends around an angle but cannot wrap over itself.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Linear Stair</strong>: This creates a straight staircase that does not bend.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Spiral Stair</strong>: This creates a spiral staircase that can repeatedly wrap over itself.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Sphere</strong>: This creates a sphere shape. The radius can be customized in <strong>Details</strong> panel.</li></ul></div><p>Just like any other actor, you can use <strong>Transform Tools</strong> to move, rotate, and scale as you see fit.</p><p>There are two types of <strong>Brushes</strong>. They are as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Additive</strong>: These brushes are solid. This will <em>add</em> geometry to the level. For example, you will use the <strong>Additive</strong> type to create walls, floors, ceilings, and so on.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Subtractive</strong>: These brushes are hollow. This will <em>subtract</em> solid space from a previously created <strong>Additive</strong> brush. For example, you will use the <strong>Subtractive</strong> type to create windows or doors on walls.</li></ul></div><p>You can also convert BSP geometry to <strong>Static Mesh</strong> and save them in <strong>Content Browser</strong>, but remember, they will have no UVs or additional Material elements. It is also worth mentioning that this is not a good or recommended workflow. You should only use BSP to block out your<a id="id47" class="indexterm"/> level and later, you should import your assets created from a DCC application.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip08"/>Tip</h3><p>You can go to <strong>Geometry Editing</strong> mode (<em>Shift</em>+<em>F5</em>) to edit vertices and create a custom shape.</p></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec11"/>Default starting level, splash screen, and game icon</h1></div></div></div><p>You can change the default <a id="id48" class="indexterm"/>starting level for both the game and editor. For example, for the game you may want the <strong>Main Menu</strong> map as the default and for editor <a id="id49" class="indexterm"/>you want another level as<a id="id50" class="indexterm"/> the default startup level.</p><p>It's easy to set them in Unreal editor:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>Edit</strong> in the menu bar.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>Project Settings</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Go to <strong>Maps &amp;</strong> <strong>Modes</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Here, you can change the game and editor default map.<div><img src="img/B03950_01_15_edited.jpg" alt="Default starting level, splash screen, and game icon"/></div></li></ol></div><p>You can adjust <strong>Splash</strong> <a id="id51" class="indexterm"/>screen through <strong>Project Settings</strong>:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to <a id="id52" class="indexterm"/><strong>Windows</strong> sections.</li><li class="listitem">Change the <strong>Splash</strong> <a id="id53" class="indexterm"/>screen and the game <strong>Icon</strong> from here.</li></ol></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip09"/>Tip</h3><p>The default dimensions for <strong>Splash</strong> screens are <strong>600 x 200</strong> and requires a <strong>.bmp</strong> image. The game <strong>Icon</strong> requires a <strong>256 x 256</strong> <code class="literal">.ICO</code> file.</p></div></div><div><img src="img/B03950_01_16.jpg" alt="Default starting level, splash screen, and game icon"/></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec12"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>Now that you understand the basics of Unreal Engine, it's time to import some assets from a DCC application such as 3ds Max, Maya, or Blender. In the next chapter, we will create a simple mesh in 3ds Max and import it into Unreal Engine and go through various options, such as setting up materials, collisions, and LODs.</p></div></body></html>
