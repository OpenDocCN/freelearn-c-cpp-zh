- en: This chapter will introduce you to the powerful features of the Arduino Yún
    microcontroller board. In this chapter, you will learn how to create a simple
    weather station that will send data to the cloud using the features of the web-based
    service **Temboo**. Temboo is not 100 percent free, but you will be able to make
    1000 calls to Temboo per month using their free plan. You will learn how to connect
    sensors that measure temperature, humidity, and light level to your Arduino Yún.
    These sensors will first be separately tested to make sure that the hardware connections
    you made are correct.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, we are going to use the Temboo Arduino libraries to send these measurements
    to the cloud and to different web services so that they can be accessed remotely
    regardless of where you are in the world. Temboo is a web-based service that allows
    you to connect different web services together and proposes ready-to-use libraries
    for the Arduino Yún.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, the first thing we are going to do with Temboo is to send the data
    from your measurements to a Google Docs spreadsheet, where they will be logged
    along with the measurement data. Within this spreadsheet, you will be able to
    plot this data right in your web browser and see the data that arrives getting
    stored in your Google Docs account.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, we will use Temboo again to send an automated e-mail based on the recorded
    data. For example, you would like to send an alert when the temperature drops
    below a certain level in your home, indicating that a heater has to be turned
    on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, we will finish the chapter by using Temboo to post the data at regular
    intervals on a Twitter account, for example, every minute. By doing this, we can
    have a dedicated Twitter account for your home that different members of your
    family can follow to have live information about your home.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After completing this chapter, you'll be able to apply what you learned to other
    projects than just weather-related measurements. You can apply what you see in
    this chapter to any project that can measure data, in order to log this data on
    the Web and publish it on Twitter.

    with a micro USB cable to do the initial programming and testing. Also, we recommend
    that you have a power socket to the micro USB adapter so that you can power on
    your Arduino Yún directly from the wall without having your computer lying around.
    This will be useful at the end of the project, as you will want your Arduino Yún
    board to perform measurements autonomously.

- en: You will then need the different sensors which will be used to sense data about
    the environment. For this project, we are going to use a DHT11 sensor to measure
    temperature and humidity and a simple photocell to measure light levels. DHT11
    is a very cheap digital temperature and humidity sensor that is widely used with
    the Arduino platform. You can also use a DHT22 sensor, which is more precise,
    as the Arduino library is the same for both sensors. There are several manufacturers
    for these sensors, but you can find them easily, for example, on SparkFun or Adafruit.
    For the photocell, you can use any brand that you wish; it just needs to be a
    component that changes its resistance according to the intensity of the ambient
    light.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To make the DHT11 sensor and photocell work, we will need a 4.7k Ohm resistor
    and a 10k Ohm resistor as well. You will also need a small breadboard with at
    least two power rails on the side and some male-male jumper wires to make the
    electrical connections between the different components.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the software side, you will need the latest beta version of the Arduino IDE,
    which is the only IDE that supports the Arduino Yún board (we used Version 1.5.5
    when doing this project). You will also need the DHT library for the DHT11 sensor,
    which can be downloaded from [https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library).

    individually. By doing this, we will ensure that you make all the hardware connections
    correctly, and this will help a lot if you encounter problems in the next sections

    on the breadboard. This pull-down resistor will ensure that during the operation,
    if there is no light at all, the voltage seen by the Arduino board will be 0V.
    Then, connect the other end of the photocell to the red rail on the breadboard
    and the end of the resistor to the ground. Finally, connect the common pin to
    the Arduino Yún board analog pin A0.

    send its own messages on Twitter. You can even create a new Twitter account just

    dedicated Temboo libraries for the Yún. Using these libraries, we logged data
    in a Google Docs spreadsheet, created automated e-mail alerts based on our measurements,
    and published these measurements on Twitter.

    and also add many Arduino Yún boards to the project, for example, in two different
    areas of your home. In the next chapter, we are going to use the power of the
    Temboo libraries again to send power measurement data to the Web, so the energy
    consumption of your home can be monitored remotely.
