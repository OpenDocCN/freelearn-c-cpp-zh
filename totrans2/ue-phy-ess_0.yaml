- en: Giving readers practical insight into the principles of mathematics and physics
    necessary to properly implement physics within Unreal Engine 4, this book covers
    everything one needs to know in order to create a game world.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Discover how to manipulate physics within Unreal Engine 4 by learning from scratch
    the basic real-world concepts in mathematics and physics that assist in the implementation
    of physics-based objects in your game world. Then, be introduced to PhAT (Physics
    Asset Tool) within Unreal Engine 4 to learn more about developing physics objects
    for your game world. Next, dive into Unreal Engine 4's collision generation, physical
    materials, blueprints, constraints, and more to get hands-on experience with the
    tools provided by Epic Games to create the effect of the real physical world in
    Unreal Engine 4\. Lastly, you will create a working Vehicle Blueprint that uses
    all the concepts covered in this book, and also cover topics related to advanced
    physics.
