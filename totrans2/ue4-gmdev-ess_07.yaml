- en: Matinee provides the ability to keyframe various properties of actors over time,
    either dynamically in gameplay or in cinematic game sequences. The system is based
    on specialized tracks in which you can place keyframes on certain properties of
    an actor. The **user interface** (**UI**) of Matinee is similar to other nonlinear
    video editing software, which makes it easier and familiar for video editors.
