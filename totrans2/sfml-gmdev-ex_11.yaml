    user interface assembly in the course of the last chapter. Although that might
    seem like lots of code, a lot more goes into making it tick. Proper management
    of interfaces, good support from the rest of the code base, and user-friendly
    semantics of the GUI system itself are all paramount. Let's finish our goal set
    in [Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Can I Click This? – GUI Fundamentals"),
    *Can I Click This? – GUI Fundamentals*, and finally provide our users with a means
    of interfacing.

    to store the interface data. The interface data containers also need to be grouped
    by game states, which is what the next type definition is for. Similarly, GUI
    events need to be indexed by their relevant game state. The events themselves
    are stored in a `std::vector`.

    much like we did before, a factory type definition is created. The main difference
    here is that the `lambda` functions we'll be storing need to take in a pointer
    to the owner interface in order to be constructed correctly.

    to be used due to the presence of a `RegisterElement` method. It stores a `lambda`
    function with an owner interface pointer as its sole argument, which returns a
    `GUI_Element` type with a blank name, constructed from a given type denoted by
    the `l_id` argument. Its private method friend, `CreateElement`, will use the
    stored `lambda` functions and return pointers to newly created memory.

    the existence of a `LoadStyle` method that takes in a `GUI_Element` type. The
    manager class is responsible for de-serializing style files and properly setting
    up elements based on them to avoid cluttering up the element and interface classes.

    an iterator to the interface container is obtained and checked for validity. Every
    interface that belongs to the current state is then iterated over in reverse order,
    which gives newly added interfaces priority. If it is active and the mouse position
    falls within its boundaries, its `OnClick` method is invoked, with the mouse position
    passed in as the argument. The interface's `m_beingMoved` flag is then checked
    because the click might've been within the boundaries of its title bar. If so,
    the `BeginMoving` method is called to complete the drag operation. At this point,
    we simply return from the method in order to prevent a left click from affecting
    more than one interface at a time.

    Throughout this chapter, additional topics such as interface and event management,
    creation and integration of new element types, and expansion of existing code
    were covered in depth. The effectiveness of all the work that was put into the
    GUI cannot be measured in any other way but success. We are now left with a system
    that is capable of producing efficient, responsive, and fast results with the
    minimum amount of effort and code. Furthermore, you should now have the skills
