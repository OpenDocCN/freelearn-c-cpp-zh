    user interface assembly in the course of the last chapter. Although that might
    seem like lots of code, a lot more goes into making it tick. Proper management
    of interfaces, good support from the rest of the code base, and user-friendly
    semantics of the GUI system itself are all paramount. Let's finish our goal set
    in [Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Can I Click This? – GUI Fundamentals"),
    *Can I Click This? – GUI Fundamentals*, and finally provide our users with a means
    of interfacing.

    has to be the `GUI_Manager` class. It is responsible for storing all the interfaces
    in the application as well as maintaining their states. All mouse input processing
    originates from this class and is passed down the ownership tree. Let''s begin
    by getting some type definitions out of the way:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE0]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: We will use the `std::unordered_map` data structure that indexes them by name
    to store the interface data. The interface data containers also need to be grouped
    by game states, which is what the next type definition is for. Similarly, GUI
    events need to be indexed by their relevant game state. The events themselves
    are stored in a `std::vector`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, since we will be creating elements in a factory-like fashion,
    much like we did before, a factory type definition is created. The main difference
    here is that the `lambda` functions we'll be storing need to take in a pointer
    to the owner interface in order to be constructed correctly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, we're going to be mapping element type strings to actual enumeration
    values for the same. Once again, the `std::unordered_map` type comes to the rescue.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE1]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: Right off the bat, we can tell that the factory method for elements is going
    to be used due to the presence of a `RegisterElement` method. It stores a `lambda`
    function with an owner interface pointer as its sole argument, which returns a
    `GUI_Element` type with a blank name, constructed from a given type denoted by
    the `l_id` argument. Its private method friend, `CreateElement`, will use the
    stored `lambda` functions and return pointers to newly created memory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One last thing to note before diving into the implementation of this class is
    the existence of a `LoadStyle` method that takes in a `GUI_Element` type. The
    manager class is responsible for de-serializing style files and properly setting
    up elements based on them to avoid cluttering up the element and interface classes.

    registers three element types that we''re going to be working with. It also populates
    the element type map, which will be used for checks further down the line. Finally,
    it registers three callbacks: two for the left mouse button being pressed and

    made when a valid application state and an unused interface name is provided.
    Any issues when inserting are caught by the return value of the `emplace` method,
    which gets stored in the `i` variable. If it fails, the memory is de-allocated
    and `false` is returned to signify failure. Otherwise, `true` is returned.

    an iterator to the interface container is obtained and checked for validity. Every
    interface that belongs to the current state is then iterated over in reverse order,
    which gives newly added interfaces priority. If it is active and the mouse position
    falls within its boundaries, its `OnClick` method is invoked, with the mouse position
    passed in as the argument. The interface's `m_beingMoved` flag is then checked
    because the click might've been within the boundaries of its title bar. If so,
    the `BeginMoving` method is called to complete the drag operation. At this point,
    we simply return from the method in order to prevent a left click from affecting
    more than one interface at a time.

    the current application state is iterated over. If the interface is currently

    application state. If they're active, each re-draw flag is checked and the appropriate
    re-draw methods are invoked. Finally, a pointer to the `sf::RenderWindow` is passed
    into the `Draw` method of an interface so it can draw itself.

    a pointer of `GUI_Manager` is passed as its second argument. In the case of any
    other element type being passed in, the factory container is searched and the
    stored `lambda` function is invoked with the `l_owner` argument passed in to it.

    error is printed out and the file reading is stopped. Otherwise, a pointer to
    this freshly added window is obtained and its overloaded **>>** operator is used
    to read in additional information from the stream, which we covered back in the
    interface section of this chapter.

    argument to the `LoadInterface` method. The `AddElement` method of the obtained
    interface is called in order to create the appropriate element type on the heap.
    If it''s successful, the element is obtained by name and its additional information

    that any given event can be represented simply by a numeric value. Most SFML events,
    such as key bindings, fit into that category but a lot of other event types, especially
    custom events, require additional information in order to be processed correctly.

    of union restrictions. While that only applies to GUI-related events, this memory
    still needs to be de-allocated. When a binding is being destroyed, all of the
    event information is iterated over and checked to see if it is any of the four
    GUI event types, in which case the memory is safely de-allocated.

    the type inside the binding, additional information is checked in the `EventInfo`
    structure, namely the interface and element names. If those match too, they are
    recorded as event details and the event count is incremented.

    GUI Fundamentals"), *Can I Click This? – GUI Fundamentals*, our main goal was
    to achieve a simple yet powerful means of interfacing with our own application.
    Throughout this chapter, additional topics such as interface and event management,
    creation and integration of new element types, and expansion of existing code
    were covered in depth. The effectiveness of all the work that was put into the
    GUI cannot be measured in any other way but success. We are now left with a system
    that is capable of producing efficient, responsive, and fast results with the
    minimum amount of effort and code. Furthermore, you should now have the skills
    necessary to build even more element types that will enable this system to do
    amazing things.
