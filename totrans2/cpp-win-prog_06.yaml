    In `edit` mode, we just set the alignment of the edit paragraph. Remember that
    this method can only be called when the paragraph has another alignment. In `mark`
    mode, we traverse the marked paragraphs and set the alignment on those paragraphs
    that do not have the alignment already in question. Also remember that this method
    can only be called if at least one paragraph does not hold the alignment in question.
    The paragraphs that have changed alignment need to be recalculated. However, the
    new alignment does not affect the height of the paragraph, which implies that
    we do not need to call the `CalculateDocument` method for the remaining paragraphs.
