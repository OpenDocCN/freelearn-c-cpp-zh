- en: A **Graphical User Interface** (**GUI**) is a mechanism that allows the user
    to visually interact with a software through graphical objects such as icons,
    text, buttons, and so on. Internally, a GUI handles some events and binds them
    to functions, mostly called callbacks. These functions define the reaction of
    the program.

    such as buttons, windows, labels, and layouts. I don't think I need to explain

    what a layout is.

    objects on the screen. Simply put, its goal is to take care of the size and the
    position of the objects by managing a part of them. It's like a table that makes
    sure none of these objects are on top of the others, and which adapts their size
    to fill the screen as proportionately as possible.
