<span class="strong"><strong>JUCE</strong></span>
<a id="id0" class="indexterm"/>supports the development of C++ applications for a range of target platforms. These include Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, iOS, Linux, and Android. In general, <a id="id1" class="indexterm"/>this book covers the development of C++ applications using JUCE for <a id="id2" class="indexterm"/>Windows and Mac OS X, but it is relatively straightforward to apply this knowledge to build applications for the other supported target platforms.</p><p>In order to<a id="id3" class="indexterm"/> compile JUCE-based code for these platforms, typically an <span class="strong"><strong>Integrated Development Environment</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>IDE</strong></span>)<a id="id4" class="indexterm"/> is required. To compile code for Windows, the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE<a id="id5" class="indexterm"/> is recommended (supported variants are Microsoft Visual Studio 2008, 2010, and 2012). Microsoft Visual Studio<a id="id6" class="indexterm"/> is available to <a id="id7" class="indexterm"/>download from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio">http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio</a> (the free Express versions are sufficient for non-commercial development). To compile code for <a id="id8" class="indexterm"/>Mac OS X or iOS, the Xcode IDE<a id="id9" class="indexterm"/> is required. Generally, the latest public version of Xcode is recommended. This can be downloaded for free from the Mac App Store from within Mac OS X.</p><p>JUCE is provided as source code (rather than prebuilt libraries) divided into discrete but interconnected <span class="strong"><strong>modules</strong></span>. The <code class="literal">juce_core</code> module<a id="id10" class="indexterm"/> is licensed under the <span class="strong"><strong>Internet Systems Consortium</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>ISC</strong></span>) license<a id="id11" class="indexterm"/>, allowing it to be used freely in commercial and open source projects. All the other JUCE modules are dual licensed. For open source development, JUCE may be licensed under the terms of the <span class="strong"><strong>GNU General Public License</strong></span>
<a id="id12" class="indexterm"/> (Version 2 or later) or the <span class="strong"><strong>Affero General Public License</strong></span>
<a id="id13" class="indexterm"/> (Version 3). JUCE may also be used for closed-source, commercial projects using separate commercial licenses for a fee. More information on JUCE licensing<a id="id14" class="indexterm"/> is available at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.juce.com/documentation/commercial-licensing">http://www.juce.com/documentation/commercial-licensing</a>.</p><p>Unless there are very specific reasons for using a particular version of JUCE, it is recommended to use the current development version available from the project's GIT repository. This version is almost always kept stable and often includes useful new features and bug fixes. The source code<a id="id15" class="indexterm"/> is available for download, using any GIT client software, at <a class="ulink" href="http://git://github.com/julianstorer/JUCE.git">git://github.com/julianstorer/JUCE.git</a> or <a class="ulink" href="http://git://git.code.sf.net/p/juce/code">git://git.code.sf.net/p/juce/code</a>. Alternatively, the code for the current development version may be downloaded as a ZIP file from <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/julianstorer/JUCE/archive/master.zip">https://github.com/julianstorer/JUCE/archive/master.zip</a>.</p><p>You should keep the JUCE source code in its top-level <code class="literal">juce</code> directory, but you should move this directory to a sensible location on your system that suits your workflow. The <code class="literal">juce</code> directory has the following structure (directories are shown using a trailing <code class="literal">/</code>):</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>amalgamation/</strong></span>

<span class="strong"><strong>juce.h</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>modules/</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>README.txt</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Although all of these files are important, and the actual code for the JUCE library itself is located in the <code class="literal">juce/modules</code> directory, each module is contained within its own subdirectory. For example, the <code class="literal">juce_core</code> module mentioned previously is in the <code class="literal">juce/modules/juce_core</code> directory. The remainder of this chapter examines some important projects available in the <code class="literal">juce/extras</code> directory.

The following screenshot shows the <span class="emphasis"><em>Widgets</em></span> demo (as it looks on Mac OS X). This is available by navigating to the menu item <span class="strong"><strong>Demo</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Widgets</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3316_01_02.jpg" alt="The JUCE Demo application overview"/></div><p>The <a id="id24" class="indexterm"/>Widgets demonstration shows many of the commonly needed <span class="strong"><strong>Graphical User Interface</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GUI</strong></span>) controls provided by JUCE for application development.

<a id="id25" class="indexterm"/> and this is the focus of <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Building User Interfaces">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Building User Interfaces</em></span>. There are a range of sliders, dials, buttons, text display, radio buttons, and other components, which are all customizable. There are other demonstrations available by default in the <span class="strong"><strong>Demo</strong></span> menu, covering features such as <span class="strong"><strong>Graphics Rendering</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Fonts and Text</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Multithreading</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Treeviews</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Table Components</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Audio</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Drag-and-drop</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Interprocess comms</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Web Browser</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Code Editor</strong></span>.

The title bars can be configured to use the native operating system appearance. The following screenshot shows the title bar of the JUCE Demo application as it appears on the Windows platform. Notice that even though the appearance of the buttons is the same as on Mac OS X, their positions should be more familiar to users on Windows.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3316_01_03.jpg" alt="Customizing the look and feel"/></div><p>By navigating<a id="id28" class="indexterm"/> to the menu item <span class="strong"><strong>Look-and-feel</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Use native window title bar</strong></span>, the title bar can use the standard appearance available on the operating system. The following screenshot shows the appearance of the native title bar on Mac OS X:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3316_01_04.jpg" alt="Customizing the look and feel"/></div><p>The default<a id="id29" class="indexterm"/> menu bar appearance, whereby the menu items appear within the application window below the title bar, should be familiar to Windows users. Of course, this is not the default location for application menus on the Mac OS X platform. Again, this can be specified as an option demonstrated in the JUCE Demo application by navigating to the menu item <span class="strong"><strong>Look-and-feel</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Use the native OSX menu bar</strong></span>. This moves the menu bar to the top of the screen, which will be more familiar to Mac OS X users. All of these options are customizable within JUCE-based code.</p><p>JUCE also provides a mechanism to customize the look and feel of many of the built-in components using its <code class="literal">LookAndFeel</code> class. This look and feel can apply to only some of the components of a particular type or globally across the application. JUCE itself, and the JUCE Demo application, come with two look and feel options: the <span class="emphasis"><em>default</em></span> look and feel and the <span class="emphasis"><em>old, original</em></span> (that is, "old school") look and feel. In the JUCE Demo application, this can be accessed via the <span class="strong"><strong>Look-and-feel</strong></span> menu.</p><p>You should explore the JUCE Demo application before moving onto the next section, where you will build the Introjucer application that eases the management of multi-platform projects.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Building and running the Introjucer application"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec10"/>Building and running the Introjucer application</h1></div></div></div><p>The Introjucer application<a id="id30" class="indexterm"/> is a JUCE-based application for creating and managing multi-platform JUCE projects. <a id="id31" class="indexterm"/>The Introjucer application is able to generate the Xcode projects for Mac OS X and iOS, the Microsoft Visual Studio projects (and solutions) for Windows projects, and the project files for all the other supported platforms (and other IDEs, such as the cross-platform IDE CodeBlocks). The Introjucer application performs a number of tasks<a id="id32" class="indexterm"/> that make managing such projects much easier, such as:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Populating all the native IDE project files with the source code files for your project</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Configuring the IDE project settings to link to the necessary libraries on the target platform</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Adding any preprocessor macros to some or all of the target IDE projects</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Adding the library and header search paths to the IDE projects</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Naming the product and adding any icon files</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Customizing the debug and release configurations (for example, code optimization settings)</li></ul></div><p>These are<a id="id33" class="indexterm"/> all helpful when setting up a project for the first time, but even more valuable when changes need to be made later in a project. Even changing the name of the product is relatively tedious if this needs to be done in several, separate projects. With the Introjucer application, most project settings can be set within the Introjucer project file itself. When saved, this will then modify the native IDE projects with any new settings. You should be aware that this would also override any changes made to the native IDE projects. Therefore, it is wise to make all the required changes within the Introjucer application.</p><p>In addition to this, the Introjucer application includes a GUI editor for arranging any GUI components. This reduces the amount of coding required for certain types of GUI development. This part of the Introjucer application generates the C++ code required to reconstruct the GUI when your application runs.</p><p>The Introjucer application is provided as source code; you will need to build it before it can be used. The source code is located in <code class="literal">juce/extras/Introjucer</code>. In a similar way to building the JUCE Demo application, there are various IDE projects available in <code class="literal">juce/extras/Introjucer/Builds</code> (understandably there are no Introjucer builds for iOS or Android). It is preferable to build the Introjucer application in its release configuration to take advantage of any code optimizations.</p><div class="section" title="Building the Introjucer application on Windows"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10"/>Building the Introjucer application on Windows</h2></div></div></div><p>Open <a id="id34" class="indexterm"/>the appropriate solution file in <code class="literal">juce/extras/Introjucer/Builds</code> into Microsoft Visual Studio.

At this point, you should add an alias to your <code class="literal">~/Desktop</code>, or whatever suits your typical workflow.</p></div><div class="section" title="Examining the JUCE Demo Introjucer project"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec12"/>Examining the JUCE Demo Introjucer project</h2></div></div></div><p>To illustrate the <a id="id39" class="indexterm"/>structure and functionality of an Introjucer project, let's examine the Introjucer project for the JUCE Demo application. Open the Introjucer application you have just built on your system. In the Introjucer application, navigate to the menu item <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Open…</strong></span> and navigate to open the JUCE Demo Introjucer project file (that is, <code class="literal">juce/extras/JuceDemo/Juce Demo.jucer)</code>.</p><p>An Introjucer project uses a typical <span class="strong"><strong>master-detail</strong></span> interface,<a id="id40" class="indexterm"/> as shown in the following screenshot. On the left, or the master section, there are either the <span class="strong"><strong>Files</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Config</strong></span> panels, which are selectable using either the on-screen tabs or via the <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> menu. On the right, or the detail section, there are the settings associated with the selected, specific item in the master section. With the project name selected in the <span class="strong"><strong>Config</strong></span> panel in the master section, the global settings for the whole JUCE Demo project are shown in the detail section. The <span class="strong"><strong>Config</strong></span> panel shows the hierarchy of the project's available target builds for the different native IDEs.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3316_01_06.jpg" alt="Examining the JUCE Demo Introjucer project"/></div><p>In addition to these sections in the hierarchy of the <span class="strong"><strong>Config</strong></span> panel that are concerned with the native <a id="id41" class="indexterm"/>IDE targets, there is one item named <span class="strong"><strong>Modules</strong></span>. As mentioned previously, the JUCE codebase is divided into loosely coupled modules. Each module generally encapsulates a specific range of functionality (for example, graphics, data structures, GUI, video). The following screenshot shows the available modules and the modules that are enabled or disabled for the JUCE Demo project.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3316_01_07.jpg" alt="Examining the JUCE Demo Introjucer project"/></div><p>Modules may be enabled or disabled for a particular project that is based on the functionality required for the final application. For example, a simple text-editing app may not need any video or audio functionality, and the modules related to that functionality could be disabled.</p><p>Each module <a id="id42" class="indexterm"/>also has its own settings and options. In many cases, these are where there might be the option to use native libraries for certain functionality (where performance on each platform may be a high priority) or whether the cross-platform JUCE code should be used for that functionality instead (where consistency across multiple platforms is a higher priority). Each module may have a dependency on one or more other modules, in which case it will be highlighted if it has missing dependencies (and selecting the module will explain which modules need to be enabled to resolve this). To illustrate this, try turning off the checkbox for the <code class="literal">juce_core</code> module. All the other modules depend on this <code class="literal">juce_core</code> module, which, as its name suggests, provides the core functionality of the JUCE library.</p><p>Each module has a copying mode (or <span class="strong"><strong>Create local copy</strong></span>) option. With this turned <span class="emphasis"><em>on</em></span> (or set to <span class="strong"><strong>Copy the module into the project folder</strong></span>), the Introjucer application will copy the source code from the JUCE source tree into the project's local project hierarchy. With this option turned <span class="emphasis"><em>off</em></span>, the native IDE will be instructed to refer to the JUCE source files directly in the JUCE source tree. Your preference here is a matter of taste and your individual circumstances.</p><p>The left-hand <span class="strong"><strong>Files</strong></span> panel shows the hierarchy of all the source code that will be available in the native IDEs, and the binary files (for example, images, audio, XML, ZIP) that will be transformed into cross-platform source code (and included in the native IDE projects by the Introjucer application). The top-level file structure for the JUCE Demo project is shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3316_01_08.jpg" alt="Examining the JUCE Demo Introjucer project"/></div><p>Selecting a file in the <span class="strong"><strong>Files</strong></span> panel enables you to edit the file directly in the Introjucer application. It is currently more convenient to undertake the majority of the code editing in a native IDE that has features such as code completion, error checking, and so on.</p><p>Now that we are familiar with the Introjucer application, let's use it to create a project from scratch.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Creating a JUCE project with the Introjucer application"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec11"/>Creating a JUCE project with the Introjucer application</h1></div></div></div><p>This <a id="id43" class="indexterm"/>section will guide you through creating a new Introjucer project, creating a native IDE project from this, and running your<a id="id44" class="indexterm"/> first JUCE application. First, close any open Introjucer projects by navigating to the menu item <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Close Project</strong></span>. Next, choose the menu item <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>New Project…</strong></span>, and the Introjucer application will present its new project window. Using the <span class="strong"><strong>Project Folder</strong></span> section of the window, navigate to where you would like to save the project (bearing in mind the project actually comprises a folder containing a hierarchy of code and possibly binary files). As shown in the following screenshot, name the project <code class="literal">TestProject001</code> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project Name</strong></span> field, and select the <span class="strong"><strong>Create a Main.cpp</strong></span> file and a basic window option from the <span class="strong"><strong>Files to Auto-generate</strong></span> menu:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3316_01_09.jpg" alt="Creating a JUCE project with the Introjucer application"/></div><p>Finally, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Create…</strong></span> button and a familiar Introjucer project should be presented, similar to that shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3316_01_10.jpg" alt="Creating a JUCE project with the Introjucer application"/></div><p>Initially, the <a id="id45" class="indexterm"/>Introjucer application <a id="id46" class="indexterm"/>creates only one target IDE platform for the user's current platform. Right-click (on Mac OS X, press <span class="emphasis"><em>control</em></span> and click) on the project name in the <span class="strong"><strong>Config</strong></span> panel. This presents a range of options for adding the target platforms to the project, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3316_01_11.jpg" alt="Creating a JUCE project with the Introjucer application"/></div><p>Select the <span class="strong"><strong>Files</strong></span> panel and notice that the Introjucer application created three files for this basic project:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">Main.cpp</code>: This<a id="id47" class="indexterm"/> manages the lifetime of the application and includes the main entry point of the application. It also includes the code to present the main application window to the user. This window in turn presents a <code class="literal">MainContentComponent</code> object in this window, which is specified in the remaining two files.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">MainComponent.cpp</code>: This<a id="id48" class="indexterm"/> includes the code to draw content into this main application window. In this case, this is simply a "Hello world!" message, but could comprise a complex and hierarchical user interface.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">MainComponent.h</code>: The <a id="id49" class="indexterm"/>header file for the <code class="literal">MainComponent.cpp</code> file.</li></ul></div><p>It is recommended that you add any new files to the projects using this Introjucer project page. As discussed earlier, this ensures that any new files are added to all the projects for all the target platforms, rather than you having to manage this separately. In this example you will not be adding any files. Editing source files in the native IDE is not a problem even though these exact same files are used to compile on all the other platforms your project supports (that is, these files are not copied separately for each platform). You may need to be aware of some differences between compilers, but relying on the JUCE classes where possible (where this has already been taken into account) will help in this regard.</p><p>To open the project in your native IDE, first save the project by navigating to the menu item <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Save Project</strong></span>. Then, choose the appropriate option from the <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> menu to open the native project in the IDE. On Mac OS X, this menu item is <span class="strong"><strong>Open in Xcode…</strong></span>, and on Windows it is <span class="strong"><strong>Open in Visual Studio…</strong></span>. There is also a <span class="strong"><strong>Menu</strong></span> option that combines these two operations, and a shortcut button for it at the bottom of the <span class="strong"><strong>Config</strong></span> panel.</p><p>Once the <a id="id50" class="indexterm"/>project is loaded into your IDE, you should build and run the project as you did with the JUCE Demo project earlier. When this succeeds, you should be presented with a window as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3316_01_12.jpg" alt="Creating a JUCE project with the Introjucer application"/></div><p>The three source files added to the project by the Introjucer application can be seen in your native IDE. The following screenshot shows the project structure in Xcode on Mac OS X. This is similar in Microsoft Visual Studio.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3316_01_13.jpg" alt="Creating a JUCE project with the Introjucer application"/></div><p>Edit the <code class="literal">MainComponent.cpp</code> file (by single-clicking in Xcode or double-clicking in Microsoft Visual Studio). Examine the <code class="literal">MainContentComponent::paint()</code> function. This contains four function calls to draw into the <code class="literal">Component</code> object's <code class="literal">Graphics</code> context:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">Graphics::fillAll()</code>: This fills the background with a particular color</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">Graphics::setFont()</code>: This sets the font to a given font and size</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">Graphics::setColour()</code>: This sets the foreground drawing color to a particular color</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">Graphics::drawText()</code>: This draws some text at a specified location</li></ul></div><p>Experiment with changing some of these values, and build the application again.</p></div>

<a class="ulink" href="http://www.juce.com/juce/api/">http://www.juce.com/juce/api/</a>
</p><p>All the JUCE classes are documented using the <span class="strong"><strong>Doxygen</strong></span> application<a id="id53" class="indexterm"/> (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.doxygen.org">http://www.doxygen.org</a>), which turns specially formatted code comments into readable documentation pages. For this reason, you can also read the comments from within the JUCE source code header files if you prefer. This is sometimes more convenient, depending on your IDE, because you can navigate to the documentation easily from within the code text editor. Throughout the remainder of this book, you will be directed to the documentation for the key classes being discussed.</p><p>JUCE is used by a number of commercial developers for applications and audio plugins in particular.

<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec13"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>This chapter has guided you through installing JUCE for your platform, and by this point you should have a good grasp of the structure of the source code tree. You should be familiar with the capabilities of JUCE through exploring the JUCE Demo project. The Introjucer application that you will have installed and used provides a basis for creating and managing projects using JUCE and the remaining chapters of this book. You will also know where to find the JUCE documentation via the JUCE website, or within the source code. In the next chapter, you will be exploring the <code class="literal">Component</code> class in more detail to create a range of user interfaces and to perform drawing operations.</p></div></body></html>
