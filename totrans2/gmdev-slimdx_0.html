<html><head></head><body><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pref05"/>Preface</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is a quick, hands-on guide to the basics of game programming with SlimDX. SlimDX is a managed wrapper for DirectX, allowing us to use the full power of DirectX in managed languages such as C# (pronounced C Sharp). This is a huge benefit since managed languages such as C# are much nicer to work in than lower-level languages such as C++, which increases productivity since many things can be done quicker.</p><p>As you read this book, you will take a journey from creating a basic framework, to building all of your future game development projects in that framework, to handling user inputs, 2D graphics, sound, and 3D graphics. By the end of the book, you will have discovered the basics in each of these major areas of game development, enough to get you started on your first basic games.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Getting Started</em>, gets things started with SlimDX by creating a game window and basic framework for us to work in for the rest of the book, and covers some of the basics of SlimDX.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Responding to Player Inputs">Chapter 2</a>,<em> Responding to Player Inputs</em>, explains how to handle user inputs using both DirectInput and XInput to make things happen in our game.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Rendering 2D Graphics">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Rendering 2D Graphics</em>, covers drawing 2D graphics using Direct2D to create quick 2D tech demos or 2D games.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Adding Sound">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Adding Sound</em>, covers how to add sound and music to our games using both DirectSound and XAudio2.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Rendering Simple 3D Graphics">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Rendering Simple 3D Graphics</em>, dives into the world of 3D graphics. We will learn the basics of 3D graphics and how to get them on the screen using Direct3D.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Where to Go from Here">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Where to Go from Here</em>, rounds things off with a discussion of where to go from here to continue learning the art of game development, as well as brief discussions of a few other important topics.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>To work along with this book, you will need two pieces of software. The first one is Visual Studio 2012 and the second is the 2012 release of SlimDX. The first two sections of <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Getting Started</em>, guide you through getting both of these installed and where to download them from.</p><p>Graphics and sound resources are provided in the downloadable code for this book, so you do not need any software for creating them.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is for anyone who loves video games and has a desire to create their own from scratch. It is for anyone who thinks games are truly an art form that brings together a plethora of other arts (such as graphics, sounds, music, stories, level designs, and character designs) into one final product. It is also for those who enjoy programming, since programming is a big aspect for creating video games.</p><p>It will be beneficial for you to have some basic programming experience, but it is not required. This book tries to explain things well so that even if you have no experience in the topic, you will understand what's happening and why it is happening. We will use C# in this book, which is a fairly easy language to learn as well.</p><p>So basically, if you have a passion for video games and think the idea of creating your own virtual 2D or 3D worlds in the computer sounds really cool, then this book is for you. It will help you to learn the basics of the major programming areas in game development so that you can get started on your first basic games.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "We can include other SlimDX components through the use of the <code class="literal">using</code> keyword."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">public virtual void FormClosed(object o, FormClosedEventArgs e)
{
  if (!m_IsDisposed)
    Dispose();
}</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">public UserInput()
{
  InitDirectInput();
<strong>  InitXInput();</strong>

  m_KeyboardStateCurrent = new KeyboardState();
  m_KeyboardStateLast = new KeyboardState();

  m_MouseStateCurrent = new MouseState();
  m_MouseStateLast = new MouseState();

  m_Joy1StateCurrent = new JoystickState();
  m_Joy1StateLast = new JoystickState();

<strong>  m_Controller1StateCurrent = new Gamepad();</strong>
<strong>  m_Controller1StateLast = new Gamepad();</strong>
}</pre></div><p>
<strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "Click on the <strong>Install Developer SDK</strong> button."</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>
