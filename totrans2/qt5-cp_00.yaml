- en: Qt has been developed as a cross-platform framework and has been provided free
    to the public for years. It's mainly used to build GUI applications. It also provides
    thousands of APIs for easier development.

- en: Qt 5, the latest major version of Qt, has once again proven to be the most popular
    cross-platform toolkit. With all these platform-independent classes and functions,
    you only need to code once, and then you can make it run everywhere.

- en: In addition to the traditional and powerful C++, Qt Quick 2, which is more mature,
    can help web developers to develop dynamic and reliable applications, since QML
    is very similar to JavaScript.
