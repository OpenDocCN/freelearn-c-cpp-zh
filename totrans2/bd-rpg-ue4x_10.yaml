- en: In the previous chapter, we covered how to create and apply equipment to the
    player, which when equipped, affects the stats of the player. In this chapter,
    we will allow the player to level up by setting up an experience system for each
    party member, allowing party members to gain experience from enemies when winning
    in combat. When each party member gains enough experience, they will level up
    and their stats will increase at each level that the party member has gained.
    We will also fix the combat damage settings so that attacks in combat will utilize
    character stats rather than hardcoded values. Once we have fixed the combat logic,
    we will then move on to creating an ability for our character that will be activated
    by gaining a level.
