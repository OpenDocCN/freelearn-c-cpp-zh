    is a diverse range of games with wildly different mechanics and controls.

    kind of RPG you want to make, how the game is played, whether the game should
    be turn-based or real-time, and what stats the player will have to concern themselves
    with.

    files with others very easy, as long as they also have a Google account. You can

    a rough sketch, nearly all games start from some sort of a rough concept or design
    document.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A design document's purpose is to describe nearly everything about a game. In
    the case of an RPG, it would describe how the player moves around the game world,
    how the player interacts with enemies and NPCs, how combat works, and more. The
    design document becomes the basis upon which all the game code is built.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Usually, a game starts with a very rough concept.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, let's consider the RPG we'll be making in this book. I might have
    the idea that this game would be a linear turn-based RPG adventure. It's a very
    rough concept, but that's OK—while it may not be a terribly original concept,
    it's enough to begin fleshing out and creating a design document from.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Design
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The design document for the game is based on the previous rough concept. Its
    purpose is to elaborate on the rough concept and describe how it works. For example,
    while the rough concept was *linear turn-based RPG adventure*, the design document's
    job is to take that further and describe how the player moves around the world,
    how the turn-based combat works, combat stats, game over conditions, how the player
    advances the plot, and a lot more.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should be able to give your design document to any person and the document
    should give them a good idea of what your game will be like and how it works.
    This, in fact, is one of the big strengths of a design document—it's incredibly
    useful, for example, as a way of ensuring that everyone on a team is on the same
    page so to speak.

    phase, how do you actually describe how the game works?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are really no rules for how to do this, but you can divide your theoretical
    game into the important core bits and think about how each one will work, what
    the rules are, and so on. The more information and the more specific, the better
    it is. If something is vague, you'll want to expand on it.

    While the actual stats can vary, it's common to have stats such as max health,
    max MP, strength, defense, and more.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As players progress through the game, these stats also improve. Their character
    becomes better in a variety of ways, reaching maximum potential at (or near) the
    end of the game. The exact way in which this is handled can vary, but most games
    implement experience points or XP that are earned in combat; when enough XP has
    been gained, a character's *level* increases, and with it, their stats increase
    as well.

    every time they use one of their special abilities. Additionally, these abilities
    cannot be cast if the character does not have enough magic (the term for this
    varies—it might also be called *mana*, *stamina*, or *power*—really, anything

    which ability will be learned and at what level that ability is learned. When
    the character levels up, any abilities in the table that has the given level will
    be added to that character's known abilities.

- en: In the preceding sections, the design of this sample game describes a small
    range of stats for characters in the game. It also outlines a variety of formulas
    for calculating damage, leveling up, and so on.

- en: One thing to keep in mind is that these stats, values, and formulas are simply
    there to show you how to implement the core functionality of an RPG. These are
    not the be-all-end-all of stats or formulas. In fact, the design has intentionally
    used a limited set of stats and simple formulas to keep the scope simple.

- en: With this in mind, when you're working on your own game, you will have to decide
    these things for yourself—what stats your characters use, how combat works, and
    what formulas the game will use to calculate the outcome of battle. So, how do
    you come up with all of these things on your own?

- en: Unfortunately, the answer is "it depends". There's no silver bullet to balance
    your game and keep it fun. What stats you use depends on how your combat works
    (it makes no sense to have a "hit chance" stat if, for instance, your game takes
    place from a first-person perspective using guns).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another thing to keep in mind is that the actual values and formulas you use
    don't matter. What does matter is that the end result is fun, fair, and balanced.
    It doesn't matter if it takes one, one hundred, or one million experience points
    to level up if the end result is still fun and feels fair.

    the RPG of your dreams, how important it is to design your game before you begin
    developing, how to come up with a rough concept and design, and how to describe
    your game's mechanics. We've also seen an overview of the game that we will be
    developing over the course of this book.
