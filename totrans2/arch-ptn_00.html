<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>Heterogeneity, along with the multiplicity factor, leads to heightened complexity for any system development and operation. The enigmatic yet exemplary</span> software engineering (SE<span>) space is being stuffed and sandwiched with innumerable and heterogeneous technologies and tools. Their intended and insightful use seems a bit challenging, but their contributions are mesmerizing and meteoric indeed if utilized properly.</span></p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>Interestingly, every kind of asset and artifact in our personal, professional, and social environments is being embedded and emboldened by pioneering software libraries. With continuous software penetration and participation in everything we touch, feel, and use, we are to have a bevy of sophisticated and smarter applications in plenty. Precisely speaking, we are heading toward the promised software-defined world. However, the developmental and operational complexities of next-generation software applications are literally threatening. That is, leveraging the various delectable advancements in the software engineering domain actually turns out to be a difficult affair. Therefore, there is a clarion call for unearthing easy to understand and use approaches to moderate software engineering complexity.</span></p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>Accentuating, assimilating, and articulating architecturally sound principles for high-quality software implementation and delivery has been pronounced by technology experts, exponents, and evangelists as a workable way out of this dilemma. Elegantly employing architectural patterns, along with design, deployment, integration, and other specialized patterns, is the way forward for producing and running next-generation software solutions. An arsenal of software patterns (architecture, design, deployment, integration, and so on.) come in handy for the risk-free and rewarding production of highly reliable, scalable, available, performant, adaptive, and secure software systems. This book has been produced with the sole and simple aim of enumerating and expressing prominent and dominant software patterns for its readers. The various chapters and their unique contributions are briefly explained here.</span></p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><a href="25ff3818-4844-41b1-9c0a-4facdaacb222.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Demystifying Software Architecture Patterns</em>, illustrates the context for the book and describes the need for software patterns. The various architectural patterns are listed and explained in detail in order to convey the what, why, where, and how of architectural patterns.</p>
<p><a href="7ec23064-5a89-42ac-bd8b-3475eeafdcaf.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Client/Server Multi-Tier Architectural Patterns</em>, covers the client-server architecture pattern, which is one of the oldest patterns in the enterprise architecture space. There are several variants available in this architectural space, such as two-tier client-server architecture patterns, three-tier patterns, and <em>n</em>-tier patterns. With the evolution of several new types of architecture for enterprises, client-server architecture has taken a back seat in enterprise architecture. The second part of this chapter covers web application patterns. The key types of web application patterns covered in this chapter are MVC, MVP, and MVVM. Several examples of each type of pattern are also provided in this chapter.</p>
<p><a href="3e743795-bd1a-4ae3-bee9-5041ea2aeff6.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Object-Oriented Software Engineering Patterns</em>, covers object-oriented (OO) software engineering patterns. This chapter serves to give you a refresher on the fundamentals of OO design principles and best practices. We believe that OO programming patterns are the basis of the modern software design paradigm and help you get a better understanding of other patterns. This chapter covers various prominent creational, structural, and behavioral OO patterns, along with concurrency architectural patterns such as half-sync/half-async, and leader/followers as well.</p>
<p><a href="33629424-06c7-4e1c-87f8-367f303d49e5.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Enterprise Integration Patterns</em>, describes the various enterprise integration patterns. In the modern world, there are a plethora of commercial applications. Some of them are commercial off-the-shelf applications, while others are legacy applications that are custom built as per the requirements of the organization. Since there are so many silos of applications within an enterprise, it becomes necessary to integrate them to ensure they work seamlessly. This chapter covers the key patterns that are available for enterprise integration. The key types of enterprise integration patterns that are covered in this chapter are messaging patterns, mobile integration patterns, and API management patterns.</p>
<p><span><a href="3bee4f54-fb06-49c9-96d9-7f3009da0fbb.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, </span><em>Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Principles and Patterns</em><span>, illustrates </span><strong>domain-driven design</strong><span> (</span><strong>DDD</strong><span>) principles and patterns. This chapter helps you learn about DDD principles, practices, and a few critical patterns, and how they support technology and business excellence brought together to create sophisticated software. We focus on the domain, ubiquitous language communication, bounded contexts, aggregates, and more DDD aspects. This chapter covers a few critical and prominent DDD patterns to help you learn about strategic, tactical, legacy integration, distributed contexts, and also learn about two emerging patterns, domain events and event sourcing.</span></p>
<p><a href="ea8c8c24-d3ed-4a18-b731-44035f164caf.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Enterprise Architecture Platforms and Tools</em>, presents the unique capabilities of enterprise architecture platforms and tools. Enterprise architecture helps to map all software-related processes in an enterprise into a framework in such a way that all the objectives of the enterprise are fulfilled. This chapter discusses two prominent enterprise architecture frameworks that are widely used in the IT industry landscape: TOGAF and Zachman's framework. Some prominent architecture platforms and tools, such as Enterprise Architect, Dragon, and Abacus, are also discussed in this chapter.</p>
<p><a href="45460494-ac40-47e3-9d76-731dd2a48e12.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)</em>, demystifies the popular <strong>service-oriented architecture</strong> (<strong>SOA</strong>) patterns that produce service-oriented applications. This chapter provides details on the principles, best practices, and characteristics of SOA. You will also learn about the most common SOA patterns that deal with web service security, inter-service communication, messaging, service versioning, and service refactoring. This chapter has a table that helps you understand various patterns and their associated SOA principles.</p>
<p><a href="dd57ac86-dadf-486b-9ecd-068e1f8ffc59.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Event-Driven Architectural Patterns</em>, covers emerging and evolving event-driven architecture patterns. Modern organizations are agile in nature and want to adopt architectural styles that permit them to work in an agile manner. Event-driven architectural patterns were developed mainly to meet this need. This chapter provides exhaustive coverage of popular event-driven patterns. Recent trends in the event-driven architecture space are also discussed in this chapter.</p>
<p><a href="45854889-267b-45bb-b951-a54c22f5d850.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Microservices Architecture Patterns</em>, explains the various <strong>microservices architecture</strong> (<strong>MSA</strong>). With containerization spreading its wings wider, the roles and responsibilities of microservices in producing enterprise-scale, elastic, extensible, and dynamic applications is bound to increase. The various architecture and design patterns are explained, along with use cases.</p>
<p><a href="b804250c-b28b-4057-ae1d-c95a252bb60a.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Patterns for Containerized and Highly Reliable Applications</em>, talks about the distinct contributions of various design patterns for producing containerized and highly reliable applications. The convergence of containers and microservices, along with the arrival of various container and cluster management and orchestration platforms, guarantees the realization of highly resilient microservices that in turn lead to reliable applications.</p>
<p><a href="ea7a81f1-7483-4865-8de3-b61675199994.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Software-Defined Clouds - Architecture and Design Patterns</em>, provides information about cloud application architecture and its various design patterns. As we all know, all kinds of legacy and monolithic applications are being modernized and migrated to cloud environments. This chapter prescribes the ways and means of smartly leveraging the patterns for swift and sagacious cloud adoption.</p>
<p><a href="f7942d4d-0f3c-4aed-ac2c-42a61867d40b.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Big Data Architecture and Design Patterns</em>, provides you with a head start with big data architecture patterns and big data design patterns. The patterns are grouped by layers, such as the data ingestion layer, data storage layer, and data access layer, to help you learn about unified architecture involving data sources, data messaging, data analysis, and consumption. A few of the prominent patterns covered in this chapter are data lakes, lambda architecture, short summaries for workload patterns, polyglots, and connectors. <span>This chapter also covers a few of the fundamentals of big data.</span></p>
