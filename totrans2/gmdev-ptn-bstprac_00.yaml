- en: As your programs get larger, it is critical that you understand how to write
    code in such a way that classes and modules can communicate with each other in
    an intelligent way. Knowing how to write code that is clean and extensible is
    critical for the success of medium to large scale projects, especially if there
    are multiple programmers involved. We don't want to spend time rewriting another
    programmer’s code because it is easier than figuring out how the original code
    works. Likewise, we don’t want other programmers to be confused by our code and
    rewrite solutions to problems that we already solved.

- en: This book explores the ins and outs of the most common ways to design code so
    that it can be understood, reused, maintained, and extended if necessary. These
    common design patterns will make communication between classes simple and clean.
    Whether you are using a commercial game engine or writing your own from scratch,
    knowledge of these patterns will make your game project more likely to succeed.

- en: Each chapter of this book explores one of the most used design patterns for
    games. Together we discuss the problems that we are trying to solve and how a
    specific pattern can be of use to us. Within each chapter, we also cover the pros
    and cons of the pattern so you are better equipped to know when to use it. This
    book is not a "cook book". Using a pattern in your project isn’t as simple as
    copying some code that we provide. Instead of learning recipes for code, we are
    going to learn the fundamentals of how a game engine should be written.

- en: We will do this by looking at lots of code examples. As we said, these example,
    can’t simply be copy and pasted into any project. However, by understanding how
    these examples fit into the specific project for this book, you can implement
    them in any project.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To write code, all you really need is a text editor, but for serious development
    you'll need to use an IDE (Integrated Developer Environment). We use Microsoft
    Visual Studio 2015 and C++ in this book using a Windows computer but, the concepts
    taught can be used within any programming language as well. For those of you that
    do not have Visual Studio installed, but are using Windows we do go over how to
    install the free Visual Studio Community version and set it up with our project
    in [Chapter 1](part0020.html#J2B80-04600e4b10ea45a2839ef4fc3675aeb7), *Introduction

- en: This book is for anyone who wants to learn how to write better, cleaner code. 
    While design patterns in general do not require any specific programming language,
    the examples in this book are written in C++.  Readers will get much more out
    of this book if they are already familiar with C++ and STL containers.  The project
    that is included with this book was written and compiled using Microsoft Visual
    Studio 2015, so familiarity with that IDE will be very helpful as well.
