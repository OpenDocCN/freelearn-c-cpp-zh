JUCE itself comprises of a wide range of classes that solve common problems encountered when developing software systems. These include handling graphics, sound, user interaction, networks, and so on. Due to its level of audio support JUCE is popular for developing audio applications and audio plugins, although this is by no means limits its use to this domain. It is relatively easy to get started with JUCE, and each JUCE class offers few surprises. At the same time, JUCE is powerful and customizable with little effort.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Installing JUCE and the Introjucer Application">Chapter 1</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Installing JUCE and the Introjucer Application</em></span>, guides the user through installing JUCE and covers the structure of the source code tree, including some of the useful tools available for creating JUCE projects. By the end of this chapter, the user will have installed JUCE, created a basic project using the Introjucer application and be familiar with the JUCE documentation.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Building User Interfaces">Chapter 2</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Building User Interfaces</em></span>, covers the JUCE <code class="literal">Component</code> class, which is the main building block for creating graphical user interfaces in JUCE. By the end of this chapter, the user will be able to create basic user interfaces and perform fundamental drawing within a component. The user will also have the skills required to design and build more complex interfaces.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Essential Data Structures">Chapter 3</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Essential Data Structures</em></span>, describes JUCE's important data structures, many of which could be seen as replacements for some of the standard library classes. This chapter also introduces the essential classes for JUCE development. By the end of this chapter, the user will be able to create and manipulate data in a range of JUCE's essential classes.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Using Media Files">Chapter 4</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Using Media Files</em></span>. JUCE provides its own classes for reading and writing files and many helper classes for specific media formats. This chapter introduces the main examples of these classes. By the end of this chapter, the user will be able to manipulate a range of media files using JUCE.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Helpful Utilities">Chapter 5</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Helpful Utilities</em></span>. In addition to the essential classes introduced in earlier chapters, JUCE includes a range of classes for solving common problems in application development. By the end of this chapter, the user will have an awareness of some of the additional, helpful utilities offered by JUCE.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>You will need a Mac OS X or Windows computer that supports an appropriate <span class="strong"><strong>Integrated Development Environment</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>IDE</strong></span>). Any relatively recent computer should be sufficient. On Mac OS X, you should be running the Mac OS X 10.7 "<span class="emphasis"><em>Lion</em></span>" operating system (or later). Most relatively recent Windows computers will support an appropriate version of the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE. Setting up the IDE for JUCE development is covered in <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Installing JUCE and the Introjucer Application">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Installing JUCE and the Introjucer Application</em></span>.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is for programmers with a basic grasp of C++. The examples start from a basic level, making few assumptions beyond fundamental C++ concepts. For example, not even an understanding of the C++ Standard Library is needed. Those without any experience with C++ should be able to follow and construct the examples, although may need further support to understand the fundamental concepts. Experienced programmers should also find they get to grips the JUCE library more quickly.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Conventions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish among different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text are shown as follows: "We can include other contexts through the use of the <code class="literal">include</code> directive."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">class MainContentComponent : public Component
{
public:
  MainContentComponent()
