    in game development. Some of these tools can be used in Cocos2d-x. With the use
    of these tools, you can quickly and efficiently develop your game. You can, for
    example, use original fonts and create sprite sheets, a map like a role-playing
    game, complex physical objects, and so on. In this chapter, you will learn how
    to use these extra tools in your game development.

    be at the location. For example, (0,0) is a road, (0,1) is a grass, (0,2) is a
    river and so on. Tiled maps are very useful but they are pretty hard to create
    by hand. **Tiled** is a tool that can be used to just create tiled maps. Tiled
    is a free application. However, this application is a very powerful, useful and
    popular tool. There are various kinds of Tiled Map, for example, 2D maps such
    as Dragon Quest, Horizontal scrolling game map such as Super Mario and so on.
    In this recipe, you can basically use texture packer.

- en: In games, you have to use text frequently. In which case, if you used the system
    font to display the text, you will have some problems. That's why there are different
    fonts for each device. The bitmap fonts are faster to render than the TTF fonts.
    So, Cocos2d-x uses the bitmap font to display the fps information in the bottom-left
    corner. Therefore, you should add the bitmap font into your game to display the
    text. In this recipe, you will learn how to use **Glyph Designer** which is the
    tool to make the original bitmap font and how to use the bitmap font in Cocos2d-x.
