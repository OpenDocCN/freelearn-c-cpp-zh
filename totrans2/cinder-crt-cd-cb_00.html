It is developed in C++ for increased performance and allows for the fast creation of visually complex and interactive applications. The big advantage of Cinder is that it can target many platforms such as Mac, Windows, and iOS with the exact same code.</p><p><em>Cinder Creative Coding Cookbook</em> will show you how to develop interactive and visually dynamic applications using simple-to-follow recipes.</p><p>You will learn how to use multimedia content, draw generative graphics in 2D and 3D, and animate them in compelling ways.</p><p>Beginning with creating simple projects with Cinder, you will use multimedia, create animations, and interact with the user.</p><p>From animation with particles to using video, audio, and images, the reader will gain a broad knowledge of creating creative applications using Cinder.</p><p>With recipes that include drawing in 3D, image processing, and sensing and tracking in real-time from camera input, this book will teach you how to develop interactive applications that can be run on a desktop computer, mobile device, or be a part of an interactive installation.</p><p>This book will give you the necessary knowledge to start creating projects with Cinder that use animations and advanced visuals.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Getting Started</em>, teaches you the fundamentals of creating applications using Cinder.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Preparing for Development">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Preparing for Development</em>, introduces several simple recipes that can be very useful during the development process.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Using Image Processing Techniques">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Using Image Processing Techniques</em>, consists of examples of using image processing techniques implemented in Cinder and using third-party libraries.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Using Multimedia Content">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Using Multimedia Content</em>, teaches us how to load, manipulate, display, save, and share videos, graphics, and mesh data.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Building Particle Systems">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Building Particle Systems</em>, explains how to create and animate particles using popular and versatile physics algorithms.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Rendering and Texturing Particle Systems">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Rendering and Texturing Particle Systems</em>, teaches us how to render and apply textures to our particles in order to make them more appealing.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Using 2D Graphics">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Using 2D Graphics</em>, is about how to work and draw with 2D graphics using the OpenGL and built-in Cinder tools.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Using 3D Graphics">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Using 3D Graphics</em>, goes through the basics of creating graphics in 3D using OpenGL and some useful wrappers that Cinder includes in some advanced OpenGL features.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Adding Animation">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Adding Animation</em>, presents the techniques of animating 2D and 3D objects. We will also introduce Cinder's features in this field such as Timeline and math functions.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Interacting with the User">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Interacting with the User</em>, creates the graphical objects that react to the user using both mouse and touch interaction. It also teaches us how to create simple graphical interfaces that have their own events for greater flexibility, and integrate with the popular physics library Bullet Physics.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Sensing and Tracking Input from the Camera">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Sensing and Tracking Input from the Camera</em>, explains how to receive and process data from input devices such as a camera or a Microsoft Kinect sensor.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Using Audio Input and Output">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Using Audio Input and Output</em>, is about generating sound with the examples, where sound is generated on object's collision in physics simulation. We will present examples of visualizing sound with audio reactive animations.</p><p><em>Appendix</em>, <em>Integrating with Bullet Physics,</em> will help us learn how to integrate Bullet Physics library with Cinder.</p><p>This chapter is available as a downloadable file at: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/downloads/Integrating_with_Bullet_Physics.pdf">http://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/downloads/Integrating_with_Bullet_Physics.pdf</a></p></div></div>
