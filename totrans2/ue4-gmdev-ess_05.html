They are:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Directional Light</strong>: Simulates<a id="id192" class="indexterm"/> light from a source that is infinitely far away. Since all shadows cast by this light will be parallel, this is the ideal choice for simulating sunlight.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Spot Light</strong>: Emits <a id="id193" class="indexterm"/>light from a single point in a cone shape. There are two cones (inner cone and outer cone). Within the inner cone, light achieves full brightness and between the inner and outer cone a falloff takes place, which softens the illumination. That means after the inner cone, light slowly loses its illumination as it goes to the outer cone.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Point Light</strong>: Emits<a id="id194" class="indexterm"/> light from a single point to all directions, much like a real-world light bulb.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Sky Light</strong>: Does <a id="id195" class="indexterm"/>not really emit light, but instead captures the distant parts of your scene (for example, Actors that are placed beyond <a id="id196" class="indexterm"/><strong>Sky Distance Threshold</strong>) and applies them as light. That means you can have lights coming from your atmosphere, distant mountains, and so on. Note that <strong>Sky Light</strong> will only update when you rebuild your lighting or by pressing <strong>Recapture Scene</strong> (in the <strong>Details</strong> panel with <strong>Sky Light</strong> selected).</li></ul></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec49"/>Common light settings</h2></div></div></div><p>Now <a id="id197" class="indexterm"/>that we know how to place lights into a scene, let's<a id="id198" class="indexterm"/> take a look at some of the common settings of a light. Select your light in a scene and in the <strong>Details</strong> panel you will see these settings:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Intensity</strong>: Determines the intensity (energy) of the light. This is in lumens so, for example, 1700 lm corresponds to a 100 W bulb.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Light Color</strong>: Determines the color of the light.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Attenuation Radius</strong>: Sets the limit of the light. It also calculates the falloff of the light. This setting is only available in <strong>Point Lights</strong> and <strong>Spot Lights</strong>.<div><img src="img/B03950_05_03.jpg" alt="Common light settings"/><div><p>Attenuation Radius from left to right: 100, 200, 500.</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Source Radius</strong>: Defines the size of specular highlights on surfaces. This effect can be subdued by adjusting the <strong>Min Roughness</strong> setting. This also affects building light using <strong>Lightmass</strong>. A larger<strong> Source Radius</strong> will cast softer shadows. Since this is processed by <strong>Lightmass</strong>, it will only work on <strong>Lights</strong> with mobility set to <strong>Static</strong>.<div><img src="img/B03950_05_04.jpg" alt="Common light settings"/><div><p>Source Radius 0. Notice the sharp edges of the shadow.</p></div></div><div><img src="img/B03950_05_05.jpg" alt="Common light settings"/><div><p>Source Radius 5. Notice the soft edges of the shadow.</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Source Length</strong>: Same as <strong>Source Radius</strong>.</li></ul></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec50"/>Light mobility</h2></div></div></div><p>Light mobility<a id="id199" class="indexterm"/> is an important setting to keep in mind when <a id="id200" class="indexterm"/>placing lights in your level because this changes the way light works and impacts on performance. There are three settings that you can choose. They are as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Static</strong>: A <a id="id201" class="indexterm"/>completely static light that has no impact on performance. This type of light will not cast shadows or specular on dynamic objects (for example, characters, movable objects, and so on). Example usage: Use this light where the player will never reach, such as distant cityscapes, ceilings, and so on. You can literally have millions of lights with static mobility.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Stationary</strong>: This <a id="id202" class="indexterm"/>is a mix of static and dynamic lights and can change its color and brightness while running the game, but cannot move or rotate. Stationary lights can interact with dynamic objects and are used where the player can go.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Movable</strong>: This<a id="id203" class="indexterm"/> is a completely dynamic light and all properties can be changed at runtime. Movable lights are heavier on performance so use them sparingly.</li></ul></div><p>Only four or fewer stationary lights are allowed to overlap each other. If you have more than four stationary lights overlapping each other, the light icon will change to red X, which indicates that the light is using dynamic shadows at a severe performance cost!</p><div><img src="img/B03950_05_06.jpg" alt="Light mobility"/></div><p>In the following screenshot, you can easily see the overlapping light.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_05_07_revised.jpg" alt="Light mobility"/></div><p>In <strong>View</strong> Mode, you <a id="id204" class="indexterm"/>can change to <strong>Stationary Light Overlap</strong> to see which light is causing an issue.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec27"/>Lightmass Global Illumination</h1></div></div></div><p>Lightmass is the <a id="id205" class="indexterm"/>high-quality static Global Illumination solver created by Epic games. <strong>Global Illumination</strong> (<strong>GI</strong>) means the process that simulates indirect lighting (for example, light bouncing and color bleeding from surfaces). In Unreal Engine, light bounces by default with Lightmass and is based on the base color of your material, which controls how much light should bounce from the surface of the object. Even though a more highly saturated color will bounce more light, and a less saturated color will bounce less, it all depends on the scene. In a simple room-like scene, this can be noticeable, whereas if it's an outdoor day scene this might not be that noticeable.</p><p>Let's take a quick look at the following scene:</p><div><img src="img/B03950_05_08.jpg" alt="Lightmass Global Illumination"/></div><p>This is a <a id="id206" class="indexterm"/>simple scene in unlit mode.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_05_09.jpg" alt="Lightmass Global Illumination"/></div><p>Now I added <a id="id207" class="indexterm"/>one <strong>Directional Light</strong> and this is how it looks with no GI. That means there is only direct lighting and no indirect lighting (meaning there is no light bouncing).</p><div><img src="img/B03950_05_10.jpg" alt="Lightmass Global Illumination"/></div><p>The previous screenshot is with static GI and you can see how the whole scene came to life with GI. Notice how the pillars are casting shadows. These are called <a id="id208" class="indexterm"/>
<strong>Indirect Shadows</strong> since they are from <a id="id209" class="indexterm"/>
<strong>Indirect Light</strong>.</p><p>The intensity and color of indirect light depends on the light and base color of the material that the light is bouncing off. To illustrate this effect, let's take a look at the following two screenshots:</p><div><img src="img/B03950_05_11.jpg" alt="Lightmass Global Illumination"/></div><p>Here I applied a pure red material (the red value is 1.0) to the sphere and you can see bounced lighting picked up the base color of the red sphere changing the environment. This is called color bleeding and is most noticeable with highly saturated colors.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_05_12.jpg" alt="Lightmass Global Illumination"/></div><p>In this screenshot, I changed the value of red to 0.1 and rebuilt the lighting. And since red is more dark now, less light is bouncing. This is because darker colors will absorb the light instead of reflecting it.</p><p>Now that we know what Lightmass is, let's take a look at how we can prepare our assets to use Lightmass and learn more about Lightmass settings.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec51"/>Preparing your assets for precomputed lighting</h2></div></div></div><p>In <a id="id210" class="indexterm"/>order for your asset to have clean light and shadow details, it is necessary to have uniquely unwrapped UV to represent its own space to receive dark and light information. One rule of thumb when creating lightmap UVs is that the UV face should never overlap with any other face within the UV space. This is because if they are overlapping, then after light building, the lightmap corresponding to that space will be applied to both faces, which will result in inaccurate lighting and shadow errors. Overlapping faces are good for normal texture UVs since the texture resolution will be higher for each face, but the same rule does not apply for lightmap UVs. In a 3D program, we unwrap lightmap UVs to a new channel and use that channel in Unreal Engine 4.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_05_13.jpg" alt="Preparing your assets for precomputed lighting"/></div><p>Here, you<a id="id211" class="indexterm"/> can see I'm using the second channel in my mesh for lightmap.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note11"/>Note</h3><p>Unreal starts counting from 0 while most 3d programs count from 1. That means UV channel 1 in the 3d program is UV channel 0 in Unreal, and UV channel 2 means UV channel 1 in Unreal. Here, in the previous screenshot, you can see the <strong>Light Map Coordinate Index</strong> is <strong>1</strong>, which means it is using the 2nd UV channel in mesh.</p></div></div><p>Even though you can generate lightmap UVs in Unreal Engine 4, it is highly recommended to create these UVs in a 3d program (for example, Autodesk Maya, Autodesk 3dsmax, Modo, and so on) in order to have clean lightmaps. Before creating a lightmap UV you have to set up the grid setting in your 3d app's UV editor. For example, if you have an asset that requires a lightmap resolution of 128, then your grid setting should be <em>1/126</em>, which is <em>0.00793650</em>. 128 will be the lightmap texture resolution. Higher values, such as 256, 512, 1024, and so on, will result in high-quality lightmaps but will also increase <a id="id212" class="indexterm"/>memory usage. Once we decide what lightmap resolution we need for our asset, we subtract 2 (you can also use 4) from that resolution. The reason behind this is that in order for Lightmass to calculate correctly without any filter bleeding errors, it is recommended to have a minimum of 2 pixel gaps between UVs. So if your asset is going to use a lightmap resolution of 128, it will be <em>128 – 2 = 126</em>. The reason why we divide it by 1 is that by default, Lightmass uses a 1 pixel border for filtering purposes.</p><p>Once you import your mesh into Unreal Engine 4, you set the Light Map Resolution for your Static Mesh. This value controls how good the shadow will look when another object casts a shadow onto this object.</p><p>Lightmaps are textures generated by Unreal Engine and overlayed on top of your scene. Since this is a texture, it should be in power of two (for example, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, etc.).</p><div><img src="img/B03950_05_14.jpg" alt="Preparing your assets for precomputed lighting"/></div><p>The floor <a id="id213" class="indexterm"/>in the preceding screenshot has a lightmap resolution of <strong>32</strong>. Notice inaccurate shadows on the floor.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_05_15.jpg" alt="Preparing your assets for precomputed lighting"/></div><p>The floor in the preceding screenshot has a lightmap resolution of <strong>256</strong>. Notice better shadows on the floor.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note12"/>Note</h3><p>Even though increasing the lightmap resolution gives accurate shadows, it is not a good idea to increase it for every mesh in your level as it will severely increase build times and may even crash the whole editor. For smaller objects, it is always a good idea to keep it low.</p></div></div><p>In Unreal <a id="id214" class="indexterm"/>Engine 4, you can generate lightmap UVs when importing your mesh by enabling <strong>Generate Lightmap UVs</strong>.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_05_16.jpg" alt="Preparing your assets for precomputed lighting"/></div><p>In case you miss this option, you can still generate lightmap UVs after importing. To do that perform the <a id="id215" class="indexterm"/>following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Double-click on the <strong>Static Mesh</strong> in <strong>Content Browser</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Then, under the <strong>LOD</strong> tab, enable <strong>Generate Lightmap UVs</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Select <strong>Source Lightmap Index</strong>. Most of the time this will be <strong>0</strong> since that is normal texture UVs, and Unreal generates your lightmap UVs from texture UVs.</li><li class="listitem">Set <strong>Destination Lightmap Index</strong>.

In order to have high-quality static Global Illumination (aka <strong>Precomputed Lighting</strong>), you need to have a <strong>Lightmass Importance Volume</strong> in your scene. This is because in many maps, we have areas large enough and the playable area is actually smaller. So instead of calculating lighting for the whole scene, which can increase light building heavily, we limit the area by using <strong>Lightmass Importance Volume</strong>. </p><p>Once we have a <strong>Lightmass Importance Volume</strong> in the scene and start light building, Lightmass will only calculate lighting within the volume. All objects outside the volume will only get one bounce of light with low quality.</p><p>To enclose the playable area in <strong>Lightmass Importance Volume</strong> you just have to drag and drop it from the <strong>Modes</strong> tab. Just like other objects, you can use transform tools (<em>W</em> to move, <em>E</em> to rotate, and <em>R</em> to scale) to adjust <strong>Lightmass Importance Volume</strong> in your scene. Once that is done, all you have to do is build the lighting from the <strong>Build</strong> button.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_05_19.jpg" alt="Building a scene with Lightmass"/></div><p>Alternatively, you can simply press the <strong>Build</strong> button, which will build the lighting. Lightmass has four different quality levels that you can choose from. They are <strong>Preview</strong>, <strong>Medium</strong>, <strong>High</strong>, and <strong>Production</strong>.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_05_20.jpg" alt="Building a scene with Lightmass"/></div><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Preview</strong>: Can be used while developing and this results in building the light faster.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Production</strong>: When<a id="id218" class="indexterm"/> your project is near-complete or ready to ship you should use the production setting since it makes the scene more realistic and corrects various light bleed errors.</li></ul></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip20"/>Tip</h3><p>Lighting quality are just presets.

Let's take a look at these settings:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Static Lighting Level</strong>: This setting calculates the detail when building the light. Smaller values will have more detail but greatly increase build time! Larger values can be used for huge levels to lower build times.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Num Indirect Lighting Bounces</strong>: This determines how many times the light should bounce off surfaces. 0 is direct lighting only, meaning there will be no Global Illumination, and 1 is one bounce of indirect lighting, and so on. Bounce 1 contributes most to the visual quality, and successive bounces are nearly free but do not add very much light since bounced light gets weaker after each bounce.<div><img src="img/B03950_05_23.jpg" alt="Tweaking Lightmass settings"/><div><p>Num Indirect Lighting Bounces set to 1</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Indirect Lighting Quality</strong>: Higher<a id="id222" class="indexterm"/> settings result in fewer artifacts such as noise, splotchiness, and so on, but will also increase build time. Using this setting with <strong>Indirect Lighting Smoothness</strong> helps to get detailed indirect shadows and ambient occlusion.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Indirect Lighting Smoothness</strong>: Higher values will cause Lightmass to smooth out indirect lighting but will lose detailed indirect shadows.<div><img src="img/B03950_05_24.jpg" alt="Tweaking Lightmass settings"/><div><p>Indirect Lighting Quality and Smoothness set to 1.0</p></div></div><div><img src="img/B03950_05_25.jpg" alt="Tweaking Lightmass settings"/><div><p>Indirect Lighting Quality: 4.0 and Indirect Lighting Smoothness: 0.5.

<strong>Volume Light Samples</strong> are placed by Lightmass in the level after light building, and are used for dynamic objects such as characters, since Lightmass only generates lightmaps for static objects. This is also called <a id="id226" class="indexterm"/>
<strong>Indirect Lighting Cache</strong>.</p><p>In the following screenshots, you <a id="id227" class="indexterm"/>can see how the movable object (red sphere) is lit using <strong>Indirect Lighting Cache</strong>:</p><div><img src="img/B03950_05_28.jpg" alt="Tweaking Lightmass settings"/><div><p>With Indirect Lighting Cache</p></div></div><div><img src="img/B03950_05_29.jpg" alt="Tweaking Lightmass settings"/><div><p>Without Indirect Lighting Cache</p></div></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note15"/>Note</h3><p>
