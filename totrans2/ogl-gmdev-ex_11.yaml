    example, we will create a state manager later in the chapter that will manage
    different states, or modes, in the game. Another way to define state is a set
    of conditions. For example, when we set things up to render in 3D, this is one
    set of conditions or state. When we set up things to render in 2D, this is another
    set of conditions or state.

    one state, and then change to another state. OpenGL saves state in matrices. In
    order to change from one state to another, we need a way to save the current matrix,
    set up another matrix, and then return to the previous matrix once we are done.

    the full state engine.

- en: Yep, we've seen all this before. If you recall, the `Input` class assigns a
    command enum to each button that can be clicked. This code simply processes the
    command, if there was any, and sets the state based on which button was just clicked.

    special case to handle the splash screen. If we are in the `GS_Splash` game state,
    we then load the rest of the resources for the game and change the game state
    to `GS_Loading`.

- en: We covered a lot of code in this chapter. The main lesson in this chapter was
    learning how to render 2D and 3D at the same time. We then added code to load
    all of our 2D resources as sprites. We also added the ability to render text,
    and now we can see our score, stats, and credits.

- en: We implemented that state machine for the game and wired that into the input,
    update, render, and game loop systems. This included creating states for a splash
    screen, loading resources, playing the game, and displaying various game screens.

    In the next and final chapter, we will learn a few new tricks, then the rest is
    up to you!
