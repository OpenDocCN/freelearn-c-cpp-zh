- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Introduction to Unreal Engine 4"), *Introduction
    to Unreal Engine 4*, is where we begin our journey on *Unreal Engine 4 Game Development
    Essentials*. In this chapter, the reader will learn how and where to download
    Unreal Engine as well as the difference between the source version and launcher
    version. After the Engine''s installation (or compilation, if it was the source
    version) we will get comfortable with the user interface of Unreal Engine. We
    will also learn about the basics of Content Browser, BSP, and how to change the
    splash screen and the icons for your game.'

    how to import your custom FBX assets into Unreal Engine once we get the Engine
    up and running. You will learn about collisions, materials, and the level of detail.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Materials"), *Materials*, teaches you about
    the Material editor and some common nodes used to create shaders for your assets.
    After learning the basics of Material, we will create an example material function
    that can change the intensity of a normal map.'

    to post-processing after teaching you about materials. In this chapter, you will
    learn how to override the default post process settings. After that, we will learn
    how to add our own post process volume and learn a simple but very powerful feature
    called LUT. After that, we will create a special material that can be used with
    post process, and this material will have the ability to highlight user-defined
    objects in the world.'

    our *Unreal Engine 4 Game Development Essentials* journey, and this chapter will
    introduce you to the lighting system. We start of by covering the basics, such
    as placing lights and going through the common settings. You will then learn more
    about the Lightmass Global Illumination system, including how to properly prepare
    a UV channel for your asset to be used with Lightmass. By the end of this chapter,
    you will learn how to build your scene with Lightmass as well as Lightmass settings.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Blueprints"), *Blueprints*, teaches you what
    Blueprints are and about the various types of Blueprints that are available in
    the Engine. Blueprints are Unreal Engine''s number one tool that allows artists
    and designers to quickly prototype their game (or even make one!). You will also
    learn about the different graph types, such as event graph, function graph, macro
    graph, and so on, and how to spawn a Blueprint dynamically at runtime.'

    side of Unreal Engine 4 and the tool associated with it, called Matinee. You will
    learn what Matinee is, how to create one, and get familiar with the UI. After
    the basics, we will learn how to manipulate objects in Matinee as well as create
    a very basic cutscene, which we will trigger using Blueprints.'

    Graphics*, teaches you to create a basic HUD that shows the health of the player.
    Unreal Motion Graphics (UMG) is the UI authoring tool in Unreal Engine. UMG is
    used to create Player HUD, Main Menu, Pause Menu, and so on. You will also learn
    how to create 3D widgets, which can be placed in the world or attached to an actor
    class.'

    powerful and robust tool called cascade particle editor and creates a particle
    system, as no game is good without good visual effects. We then combine this with
    simple Blueprint scripting to create randomly bursting particles.'

    4 Game Development Essentials* journey. In this chapter, you will learn how to
    get Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition and learn the basics of C++ by inspecting
    the Third Person Template character class. We will then extend this class to add
    support for health and the health regeneration system. You will also learn how
    to expose variables and functions to Blueprint Editor.'
