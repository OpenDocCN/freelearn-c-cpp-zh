- en: In today's information-centric globalized world, telecommunications have become
    an essential part of our lives. They penetrate and play crucial roles in almost
    every aspect of our day-to-day activities, from personal to professional. Sometimes,
    a failure to communicate information correctly and on time may lead to significant
    loss of material assets or even casualties.

- en: Therefore, it is very important to provide the highest level of reliability
    when it comes to developing telecommunication software. However, it can be a really
    challenging task due to the inherent complexity of the domain and accidental complexity
    of the low-level tools provided by modern operating systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Boost.Asio library is aimed at reducing accidental complexity by introducing
    type systems and exploiting object-oriented methods, and decreasing the development
    time by providing high degrees of reusability. In addition to this, because the
    library is cross-platform, the applications implemented with it can be built on
    multiple platforms, which enhances software qualities even more, while decreasing
    its costs.

- en: This book contains more than 30 recipes—step-by-step solutions to various tasks
    that often (and not so often) arise in the area of network programming. All recipes
    take advantage of facilities provided by the Boost.Asio library, demonstrating
    best practices of applying the library to execute typical tasks and solve different
    problems.
