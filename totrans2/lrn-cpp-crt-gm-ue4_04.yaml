    if you have a set of actions that must be done repeatedly to accomplish some goal.
    For example, the `while` loop in the following code repeatedly prints the value
    of the variable `x` as it is incremented from 1 to 5:'

    Then, we go the `while` condition. The `while` condition says that while `x` is
    less than or equal to 5, you must stay in the block of code that follows.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each iteration of the loop (an iteration means going once around the loop) gets
    a little more done from the task (of printing the numbers 1 to 5). We program
    the loop to automatically exit once the task is done (when `x <= 5` is no longer
    true).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Similar to the `if` statement of the previous chapter, entry into the block
    below the `while` loop is only allowed if you meet the condition within the brackets
    of the `while` loop (in the preceding example, `x <= 5`). You can try mentally
    subbing an `if` loop in the place of the `while` loop, as shown in the following
    code:'

    like an `if` statement, only it has this special property of automatically repeating
    itself until the condition between the brackets of the `while` loop becomes `false`.

- en: The only way past a `while` loop block is to not meet the entry condition. In
    the preceding example, once the value of `x` becomes 6 (so, `x <= 5` becomes false),
    we will not enter the `while` loop again. Since the orange portal is inside the
    loop, we'll be able to get to finished once `x` becomes 6.

    we will be stuck inside the body of the `while` loop. This is because the loop's
    exit condition (the value of `x` becomes 6) cannot be met if `x` does not change
    inside the loop body.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first statement of the `for` loop (`int x = 1`;) only gets executed once,
    when we first enter the body of the `for` loop. It is typically used to initialize
    the value of the loop's counter variable (in this case, the variable `x`). The
    second statement inside the `for` loop (`x <= 5`;) is the loop's repeat condition.
    As long as `x <= 5`, we must continue to stay inside the body of the `for` loop.
    The last statement inside the brackets of the `for` loop (`x++`;) gets executed
    after we complete the body of the `for` loop each time.
