- en: Creating games in C++ is a complicated process requiring a lot of time and dedication
    to achieve results. A good foundation of reusable classes can speed up development
    time and allow focus to be on creating a great game rather than struggling with
    low-level code. This book aims to show an approach to creating a reusable framework
    that could be used for any game, whether 2D or 3D.
