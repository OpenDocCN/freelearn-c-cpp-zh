- en: This book is a quick, hands-on guide to the basics of game programming with
    SlimDX. SlimDX is a managed wrapper for DirectX, allowing us to use the full power
    of DirectX in managed languages such as C# (pronounced C Sharp). This is a huge
    benefit since managed languages such as C# are much nicer to work in than lower-level
    languages such as C++, which increases productivity since many things can be done
    quicker.

    to building all of your future game development projects in that framework, to
    handling user inputs, 2D graphics, sound, and 3D graphics. By the end of the book,
    you will have discovered the basics in each of these major areas of game development,
    enough to get you started on your first basic games.

- en: To work along with this book, you will need two pieces of software. The first
    one is Visual Studio 2012 and the second is the 2012 release of SlimDX. The first
    two sections of [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Getting Started"), *Getting
    Started*, guide you through getting both of these installed and where to download
    them from.

- en: This book is for anyone who loves video games and has a desire to create their
    own from scratch. It is for anyone who thinks games are truly an art form that
    brings together a plethora of other arts (such as graphics, sounds, music, stories,
    level designs, and character designs) into one final product. It is also for those
    who enjoy programming, since programming is a big aspect for creating video games.

- en: It will be beneficial for you to have some basic programming experience, but
    it is not required. This book tries to explain things well so that even if you
    have no experience in the topic, you will understand what's happening and why
    it is happening. We will use C# in this book, which is a fairly easy language
    to learn as well.

    your own virtual 2D or 3D worlds in the computer sounds really cool, then this
    book is for you. It will help you to learn the basics of the major programming
    areas in game development so that you can get started on your first basic games.
