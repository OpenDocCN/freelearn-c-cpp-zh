- en: Application development has gained massive popularity because of the immense
    impact it has on various sectors. In this booming market, it has become critical
    to have the right set of tools to enable developers to build practical, user-friendly,
    and efficient applications. This book is focused on the use and implementation
    of Small Windows, which is a C++ object-oriented class library that eases the
    development of interactive Windows applications.

    introduction to Small Windows, which is a class library that encapsulates a part
    of the Win32 API.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Hello, Small World!"), *Hello, Small World!*,
    starts by building a (very) small application—the Small Windows version of the
    famous Hello World program. Then, we will continue with a (still rather small)
    application that handles circles in a window. The user can add and move circles,
    change their colors, and save and load circles.'

    a Tetris Application*, explores a version of the classic Tetris game. Seven different
    kinds of figure are falling down the screen and the user’s task is to move or
    rotate them so that as many rows as possible can be completely filled and removed.'

    with Shapes and Figures*, teaches you how to build a drawing program, which can
    be regarded as a more advanced version of the circle application. It is possible
    to create and remove figures as well as mark and drag figures.'

    continues to build the drawing program. We can define a class hierarchy with lines,
    arrows, rectangles, and ellipses.'

    and the registration of Windows classes. The Window class handles basic window
    functionality.'
