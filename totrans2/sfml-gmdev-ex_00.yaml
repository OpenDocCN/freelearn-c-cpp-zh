- en: Game development is one of the most interesting career choices to date. Apart
    from the many other fields that are incorporated in this process, it's also a
    realm where pure imagination comes to life. Even during the times when one may
    think that there's nothing new under the sun, ground-breaking ideas are still
    cemented in this medium, both as revolutionary milestones and exciting adventures
    that will make us feel child-like excitement yet again.

- en: Getting started with game programming is easier now than ever before! Documentation
    and tutorials aside, there even exist enthusiasts out there who actually put together
    libraries of code that can be used to eliminate the redundant or difficult parts
    of building different types of applications. As it so happens, one of these libraries
    is titled "Simple and Fast Multimedia Library", and it is the focal point of this
    publication.

- en: Throughout the course of this book, three projects are built from scratch, with
    each one having increased complexity compared to its preceding project. We will
    start with a basic clone of the classical arcade game—*Snake*, which introduces
    the basics of SFML and some of the framework that is going to persist until the
    very end. As difficult subjects are addressed, we will begin to cobble the second
    project together, turning it into a side-scrolling platformer. The remaining chapters
    of this book focus on building and polishing an online RPG-style game that can
    be played with your friends! No detail of any of these projects will remain undiscussed,
    as you will be guided through the entire process of planning and implementing
    every single aspect of these projects.
