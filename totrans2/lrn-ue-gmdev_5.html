<strong>artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong>AI</strong>).</p><p>Animation is what we need in order to see things move in a game. AI is what is required for characters (other than the player) to know how to behave and react while you are in the game.</p><p>We will cover the following topics in this chapter:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Definition of animation</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">3D animation</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Tools required for animation in Unreal Engine 4</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Learning to add animation to your game</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using an Animation Blueprint</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Learning about Blend Animation</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">AI in games</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Designing a<a id="id390" class="indexterm"/> <strong>Behavior Tree</strong> (<strong>BT</strong>)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using a Blueprint to implement AI in your game</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec58"/>What is animation?</h1></div></div></div><p>Animation<a id="id391" class="indexterm"/> is the simulation of movement through a series of images or frames.</p><p>Before computers came into the picture, animation was created using traditional techniques such as hand-drawn animation and stop-motion animation (or model animation). Hand-drawn animation, as the name suggests, involves hand-drawn scenes on paper. Each scene is repeated on the next sheet of paper with a slight change in the scene. All the papers are put together in sequence and the pages are turned very quickly, like a flipbook. The slight changes on the sheets of paper create 2D animation, and this can be filmed into a motion film. This technique is used very often in Disney cartoons and movies. As you can imagine, this is a very time-consuming way to produce animation, as you would need thousands of drawings to create seconds of the film.</p><p>Stop-motion animation<a id="id392" class="indexterm"/> involves creating models, moving them a little in each<a id="id393" class="indexterm"/> frame to mimic movement, and filming this sequence to construct an entire scene. The tedious process of capturing countless snippets has limited the use of this method in favor of more mainstream animation techniques today.</p><p>Computer animation<a id="id394" class="indexterm"/> is quite similar to stop-motion animation <a id="id395" class="indexterm"/>as computer graphics is moved a little in each frame; these frames are then rendered on screen. For computer games, we use computer animation by creating 3D models using tools, such as Maya and 3ds Max. Then, we animate these models to simulate life-like behavior and actions for the game. Animation is needed for all things in order to make them move. Characters need to be animated so that they can look real—they can be in an idle position, walk, run, or execute any other action that needs to be performed in the course of the game.</p><p>Motion capture<a id="id396" class="indexterm"/> is also another very popular way to animate characters these days. This technology basically uses recorded human actions to create the computer graphic character's behavior. If you have watched the movie <em>Avatar</em>, the blue avatar characters were, in fact, played by human actors and then enhanced to look the way they did using computer graphics. For the filming of the movie, they advanced the motion capture technology into what is now called<a id="id397" class="indexterm"/> <strong>performance capture</strong>. This advancement in technology has empowered film and game makers to capture the details in animation in such a way that can make a CG character stand out.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec59"/>Understanding how to animate a 3D model</h1></div></div></div><p>Although the<a id="id398" class="indexterm"/> objective of this book is not to teach you how to animate a model, it is important to understand how animation is done so that you can understand better how to get game characters in a game to move and behave according to design.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, we can animate 3D models using tools, such as Maya or 3ds Max. We can then record their changes and then render these animations on screen when needed.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec69"/>Preparing before animation</h2></div></div></div><p>In game <a id="id399" class="indexterm"/>development, the creation of animation<a id="id400" class="indexterm"/> falls under the responsibility of an animator. Before an animation can be first created, we need to first have a 3D model that's been created by a 3D modeler. The 3D modeler is responsible for giving the object its shape and texturing it. Depending on the type of object we're dealing with, the exact process to get an object properly rigged can be slightly different. Rigging needs to be done before handing over the object to the animator to create specific animations. Sometimes, animators also need to fine-tune the rigs for better control of the animation.</p><p>Rigging<a id="id401" class="indexterm"/> is a process where a skeleton is placed in the mesh and joints that are created for the skeleton. The collection of bones/joints is known as the <a id="id402" class="indexterm"/>
<strong>rig</strong>. The rig provides control points, which the animator can use to move the object in order to create the desired animation. I will use a human character model in my explanation here so that you can understand this concept easily.</p><p>The 3D or character modeler first shows how the face and body of a model are shaped. It then determines how tall the model is, creates all the required features by adding primitives to the model, and then textures it to give color to its eyes, hair, and so on. The model is now ready but still jelly on the inside because we have not given it any internal structure. Rigging is the process where we add bones to the body to hold it up. The arm can be rotated because we have given it a shoulder bone (scapula), arm bone (humerus), and a joint that can mimic the ball and socket joint. The joint we have in place for rigging is made up of a group of constraints that limit movement in various planes and angles. Hierarchies are also applied to the bone structure to help the bones link each other. The fingers are linked to the hand, which is linked to the arm. Such a relationship can be put in place so that movement looks real when one of parts moves and the rest of the parts naturally move together as well.</p><p>Tools, such as Maya and 3ds Max, provide some simplification to the rigging process, as you can use standard rigs as the base, and tweak this base according to the needs of the model. Some models are taller and require longer bones. A 3D model must have a simple skeletal structure that adheres closely to the shape and size of a 3D model. Similar sized 3D models<a id="id403" class="indexterm"/> can share the same skeletal structure.</p><p>To better <a id="id404" class="indexterm"/>understand how we can add animation to our game levels, let's learn how computer animation is created and how we can make these models move.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec70"/>How is animation created?</h2></div></div></div><p>Animation <a id="id405" class="indexterm"/>basically mimics how life moves in the real world. Many companies go to great lengths to make computer animation as accurate as possible through the use of motion capture. They film actual movements in real life and then recreate these movements using computer 3D models.</p><p>When creating animations, the animator makes use of the bones and joints created during the rigging process and adjusts them in place using as much detail as possible to mimic their natural movement. The joints and bones work together to affect the body posture. These movements are then recorded as short animation clips known as an animation sequence. Animation sequences form the most basic blocks of animation, and they can be played once or repeatedly to create an action. For example, a walking animation is only 1.8 seconds long but can be replayed over and over to simulate walking. When this sequence is repeated again, it is commonly known as an animation loop.</p><p>Animation sequences can also be linked to form a chain of actions. While transitioning from one sequence to another, some blending might be needed in order for the movement to look natural.</p></div></div>

This editor offers four different modes: <strong>Skeleton</strong>, <strong>Mesh</strong>, <strong>Animation</strong>, and <strong>Graph</strong>. These modes mainly exist so that you can jump straight into one of them to edit/create the animations more effectively. So, they are simply a loose group of functions that can be used to control the different aspects of animation. We will learn how to make use of the functions in Persona to add animation to our level.</p><p>To help improve team collaboration, Unreal Engine 4 also released a previously in-house-only toolset, which is a plugin for Maya (compatible for Maya 2013 and higher versions), known as <a id="id407" class="indexterm"/>
<strong>Animation and Rigging Toolset</strong> (<strong>ART</strong>). This toolset provides a user interface to allow the creation of a skeleton, placement of the skeleton, and rig creation within Maya itself. We will not go into the details of this toolset, but you can find more information on this in Unreal's online documentation at <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Content/Tools/MayaRiggingTool/index.html">https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Content/Tools/MayaRiggingTool/index.html</a>.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec71"/>Importing animation from Maya/3ds Max</h2></div></div></div><p>As many artists use<a id="id408" class="indexterm"/> Maya and 3ds Max to create 3D models and <a id="id409" class="indexterm"/>animation, Unreal Engine 4 has a great FBX <a id="id410" class="indexterm"/>Import pipeline that allows you to successfully<a id="id411" class="indexterm"/> import skeletal models, animation sequences, and morph targets. This makes it easy to transfer assets to the Unreal Editor and put them into the game. Unreal also tries to stabilize the import of art assets from other software, such as Blender and MODO.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec36"/>Tutorial – importing the animation pack from Marketplace</h3></div></div></div><p>Since 3D models and <a id="id412" class="indexterm"/>animation are first created outside <a id="id413" class="indexterm"/>Unreal Engine, for the purpose of learning about how animation works, we will import an animation pack that contains a 3D model with a number of animation sequences first, and we'll then learn how to make use of the different tools in the Unreal Editor for animation.</p><p>Unreal Engine offers a number of downloadable packs in Marketplace. Marketplace is in the start menu screen, which is under the <strong>Launch</strong> button.

You will see the character that you have just added to the level, is jogging.</p><p>This is the straightforward way to animate a character. However, the character continues to loop through this animation no matter what is happening around. We probably want the character to be able to react to the environment and conditions of the game. So, how can we do this?</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec73"/>Why do we need to blend animations?</h2></div></div></div><p>In the previous exercise, we <a id="id425" class="indexterm"/>learned how to make a skeletal mesh take on a single animation. But can we make the skeletal mesh start running in a straight line? The next few sections of animation exercises will explain how we can do this and, subsequently, add more to this basic animation.</p><p>First of all, you need to remember that animation sequences/poses are played when you tell them to. While animating character, you need to look into the details so that the character looks normal.</p><p>Now, let's quickly recap what we did in the previous exercise: the skeletal mesh character was a zombie with no animation attached. When we linked the run animation and set it to play, the character immediately seemed like it was running. So, if we want the character to stop running, we can remove the run animation. The character goes back to looking like a zombie that hasn't been animated. If we did this in a game, you would probably think that there is something very wrong with the animation. Zombie-&gt;Running-&gt;Zombie. Nothing realistic about it.</p><p>How can we improve this? We start with an idle pose for the character; an idle pose is one where the character stands at a fixed spot and breathes. Breathing is part of animation too. It makes the character look like it's alive. Next, we set it to play the run animation. To stop this animation, we allow the character to take the idle position again. Not a bad attempt for this iteration. The character doesn't look like a zombie now, but it looks and feels real.</p><p>What else can we do to make this even better? Let's use an analogy of someone driving a car normally (not a race car driver). When moving from the start position, you accelerate from a speed of 0 up to a comfortable cruising speed. When you want to stop, you reduce the cruising speed by stepping on the brakes and then gradually go back to 0 (to avoid a stopping suddenly and giving your passengers the unpleasant experience of being thrown forward). Similarly, we can use this to help us design our character's transition from a stationary position. We will use a tool called<a id="id426" class="indexterm"/> <strong>Blend Animation</strong> to create this transition so that we can make the movement of the character a little more realistic.</p><p>Blend Animation, as the name suggests, blends various types of animation using variables. It can be a simple one-dimensional relationship where we use speed as an axis to blend the animations or a two-dimensional relationship where we use both speed and direction to blend animations. Unreal Engine's Blend Animation tool is capable of setting up the blending of animations in different ways.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec38"/>Tutorial – creating a Blend Animation</h3></div></div></div><p>In this example, we will use <a id="id427" class="indexterm"/>speed as the parameter to blend the animation. Let's quickly cover the thought process here first before listing the steps to follow in the Unreal Editor to achieve this. This would help in your understanding of how this process works instead of simply following the process to make something happen.</p><p>At speed = 0, we assign the idle pose. As the speed increases, we should switch the animation from an idle to a walking animation. As the speed increases even more, the animation switches from walking to jogging, and then running. Here's an illustration of how the blend would look:</p><div><img src="img/B03679_05_07.jpg" alt="Tutorial – creating a Blend Animation"/></div><p>Next, let's identify which animation sequences we have in the animation pack and would be suitable for each of the stages:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Idle_Rifle_Hip</strong></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Walk_Fwd_Rifle_Ironsights</strong></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Jog_Fwd_Rifle</strong></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Sprint_Fwd_Rifle</strong></li></ul></div><p>To create a simple <a id="id428" class="indexterm"/>1D Blend Space, we can right-click on the <code class="literal">Character</code> folder, and go to <strong>Create Asset</strong> | <strong>Animation</strong> | <strong>Blend Space 1D</strong>. Alternatively, you can select the <code class="literal">Character</code> folder in <strong>Content Browser</strong>, click on the <strong>Create</strong> button at the top, go to <strong>Animation</strong>, and then <strong>Blend Space 1D</strong>.</p><div><img src="img/B03679_05_08.jpg" alt="Tutorial – creating a Blend Animation"/></div><p>Select <strong>HeroTPP_Skeleton</strong>; clicking <a id="id429" class="indexterm"/>on this creates a new Blend Space 1D. Rename <strong>newblendspace1d</strong> to <code class="literal">WalkJogRun</code>. Double-click on the newly created <strong>WalkJogRun</strong> to open the editor. This will propel you straight to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab of the editor. Notice that this part is highlighted in the following screenshot. In the <strong>SkeletonMesh</strong> field, we have <strong>HeroTPP_Skeleton</strong>, which was what we selected when creating the blend space earlier.</p><div><img src="img/B03679_05_09.jpg" alt="Tutorial – creating a Blend Animation"/></div><p>In the <strong>Animation</strong> editor, you <a id="id430" class="indexterm"/>have access to <strong>Asset Browser</strong> (which is, by default, in the bottom right-hand side of the screen). Clicking on the animation assets will allow you to preview how the animation looks.</p><p>Let's first set the <strong>X Axis Label</strong> to <code class="literal">Speed</code>. <strong>X Axis Range</strong> is from <code class="literal">0</code> to <code class="literal">375</code>. Leave <strong>X Axis Divisions</strong> as <strong>4</strong>.</p><p>The number of divisions creates segments in the speed graph that we have. Based on what we selected earlier for the Idle, Walk, Jog, and Run states, find the animation using <strong>Asset Browser</strong>, click and drop the animation into the <strong>WalkJogRun</strong> tab into the appropriate sections, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
<strong>Idle_Rifle_Hip</strong> is at speed = 0. Set <strong>Walk_Fwd_Rifle_Ironsights</strong> in the first division line. When you drag an animation into the graph, it creates a node and snaps at one of the division lines. Set <strong>Jog_Fwd_Rifle</strong> in the second division line and set <strong>Sprint_Fwd_Rifle</strong> at speed = 375. To preview how the animation blends, move the mouse over the graph along the vertical axis.</p><div><img src="img/B03679_05_10.jpg" alt="Tutorial – creating a Blend Animation"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec39"/>Tutorial – setting up the Animation Blueprint to use a Blend Animation</h3></div></div></div><p>Now we have created a<a id="id431" class="indexterm"/> Blend Animation <a id="id432" class="indexterm"/>that uses speed as a parameter. How do we make an NPC change speed and then link this animation to it so that as the speed changes and the animation that is played also changes?</p><p>For a simple implementation of getting the speed and animation to change, we will set up the Animation Blueprint. Go to <strong>Content Browser</strong>. Navigate to <strong>Animation</strong> | <strong>Character</strong>; then, navigate and click on <strong>Create Asset</strong> | <strong>Animation</strong> | <strong>Animation Blueprint</strong>:</p><div><img src="img/B03679_05_11.jpg" alt="Tutorial – setting up the Animation Blueprint to use a Blend Animation"/></div><p>Upon selecting <a id="id433" class="indexterm"/>

Name this Animation Blueprint <code class="literal">MyNPC_Blueprint</code>.</p><p>To check whether you have selected the correct target skeletal mesh, look in the <strong>Skeleton</strong> tab in the <strong>Blueprint</strong> window, as shown in the following screenshot. You should see <strong>HeroTPP_Skeleton</strong> in the box. The screenshot also shows the <strong>Graph</strong> tab that's been selected with the empty default AnimGraph showing. We will proceed through this exercise with the <strong>Graph</strong> tab selected, unless specified otherwise.</p><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl4sec10"/>AnimGraph</h4></div></div></div><p>This screenshot shows the default blank <a id="id437" class="indexterm"/>AnimGraph. <strong>Final Animation Pose</strong> will receive the output of the skeletal mesh that's been specified:</p><div><img src="img/B03679_05_13.jpg" alt="AnimGraph"/></div><p>First, we want to add a state machine by right-clicking within the AnimGraph and navigating to <strong>State Machines</strong> | <strong>Add New State Machine…</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/B03679_05_14.jpg" alt="AnimGraph"/></div><p>Rename the newly created state<a id="id438" class="indexterm"/> machine <strong>Movement</strong>:</p><div><img src="img/B03679_05_15.jpg" alt="AnimGraph"/></div><p>Double-click on <strong>Movement</strong>.

Go to the <strong>Asset Browser</strong> tab, look<a id="id439" class="indexterm"/> for <strong>WalkJogRun</strong> blendspace, which we created in the previous exercise, and click and drag it into the editor. Link <strong>WalkJogRun</strong> blendspace to the final animation, as shown in the following screenshot. Notice that speed = 0.00 is specified in the blendspace node; this was the variable that we defined to control the change of the animation when we created blendspace in the earlier exercise.</p><p>Next, we need to create a variable so that we can pass in a value to the <strong>WalkJogRun</strong> blendspace speed variable. To do so, we need to click and drag the green dot next to the <strong>Speed</strong> on the blendspace node to open up a contextual menu, look for <strong>Promote to Variable</strong>, and then click on it. This promotes speed in the blendspace node to a float variable, which we would set to control the speed and type of animation that will be played. Rename this new variable <strong>Speed</strong>. The following screenshot shows how we have created and connected a <strong>Speed</strong> variable to <strong>WalkJogRun</strong> blendspace, which is linked to <strong>Final Animation Pose</strong>:</p><div><img src="img/B03679_05_17.jpg" alt="AnimGraph"/></div><p>Now, go back to link <a id="id440" class="indexterm"/>
<strong>Movement</strong> to <strong>Final Animation Pose</strong>:</p><div><img src="img/B03679_05_18.jpg" alt="AnimGraph"/></div><p>Now, the entire AnimGraph is linked up. Click on <strong>Compile</strong>, and you would see the preview of the character model updated, as shown in the following screenshot. The white moving dots show how data flows through the system. The speed is 0 here.</p><div><img src="img/B03679_05_19.jpg" alt="AnimGraph"/></div><p>We can also use this tab to<a id="id441" class="indexterm"/> see live preview as we change the value to <strong>Speed</strong>. The following screenshot shows you when speed is 50. The character model assumes a walking pose.</p><div><img src="img/B03679_05_20.jpg" alt="AnimGraph"/></div><p>Through AnimGraph, we were able to set up <strong>Speed</strong> as a variable and link this variable to <strong>WalkJogRun</strong> blendspace, which, in turn, controls what animation to play at which speed. We need to now think about how to provide some logic to determine how the speed of the NPC changes.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl4sec11"/>EventGraph</h4></div></div></div><p>EventGraph<a id="id442" class="indexterm"/> is used to program logic into the Blueprint.</p><p>In this example, we will use EventGraph to create logic to change the speed values that will, in turn, affect the NPC's animation control.</p><p>To create a more complex intelligent decision-making process, which is termed as AI, we will need to use a set of AI-related nodes in EventGraph. We will learn more about creating AI in the next section.</p><p>The following screenshot shows the default new <strong>EventGraph</strong> tab in the Animation Blueprint.</p><p>The <strong>Event Blueprint Update Animation</strong> node can be thought of as the source that sends a pulse through the EventGraph network. As this pulse travels through the network, it goes through a series of questions that you design to determine which animation is played.</p><div><img src="img/B03679_05_21.jpg" alt="EventGraph"/></div><p>
<strong>Try Get Pawn Owner</strong> is to get the owner that Animation Blueprint is assigned to. This is simply used in combination with another node, <strong>IsValid</strong>, to ensure that we have a valid owner before setting values to change the animation.</p><p>To make <strong>MyNPC_Blueprint</strong> work for the <strong>Hero_TPP</strong> mesh that we have in the level, we will need to first delete the <strong>Try Get Pawn Owner</strong> node and replace it with <strong>Get Owning Component</strong>. Right-click on the EventGraph and type <code class="literal">Get</code>. In the contextual menu that is opened, scroll down to find <strong>Get Owning Component</strong>. This screenshot shows where the <strong>Get Owning Component</strong> node is:</p><div><img src="img/B03679_05_22.jpg" alt="EventGraph"/></div><p>In the same way, right-click in the editor<a id="id443" class="indexterm"/> and type <code class="literal">IsValid</code> to look for the node. This screenshot shows where to get the <strong>IsValid</strong> node:</p><div><img src="img/B03679_05_23.jpg" alt="EventGraph"/></div><p>Now, link the triangular output from <strong>Event Blueprint Update Animation</strong> to the <strong>Exec</strong> input of the <strong>IsValid</strong> node (which is also a triangular input).

AI is a programmable decision-making process for NPCs to govern their responses and behaviors in a game. A game character that is not controlled by a human player has no form of intelligence, and when these characters need to have a higher form of decision-making process, we apply AI to them.</p><p>AI in games has progressed tremendously over the years and NPCs can be programmed to behave in a certain way, sometimes, with some form of randomness, making it almost unpredictable so that players do not have a simple, straightforward strategy to win the level.</p><p>The decision-making process, which is also the logic of the NPCs, is stored in a data structure known as a Behavior Tree. We will first learn how to design a simple Behavior Tree then learn how to implement this in Unreal Engine 4.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec74"/>Understanding a Behavior Tree</h2></div></div></div><p>Learning how to design a <a id="id448" class="indexterm"/>good decision-making tree is very important. This is the foundation on which programmers or scripters rely to create the behavior of a character in a game. The Behavior Tree is the equivalent of a construction blueprint for architects who design your house.</p><p>A Behavior Tree has roots that branch out into layers of child nodes, which are ordered from left to right (this means that you always start from the left-most node when traversing the child nodes) that describe the decision-making process. The nodes that make up the Behavior Tree mainly fall into three categories: Composite, Decorator, or Leaf. Once you are familiar with a couple of the common types of nodes in each of the three categories, you would be ready to create your own complex behaviors:</p><div><table border="1"><colgroup><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left" valign="bottom"> </th><th style="text-align: left" valign="bottom">

<strong>Navigation Mesh</strong>. The Navigation Mesh is pretty much like a block volume; you could scale the size of the mesh to cover a specific area in the game level that an AI character can move around in.

Challenge yourself to create more complex behaviors using the knowledge gained in this section.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec80"/>Implementing AI in games</h2></div></div></div><p>I am sure you have noticed <a id="id512" class="indexterm"/>that we definitely need to create more complex behaviors<a id="id513" class="indexterm"/> to make a game interesting. In terms of implementation, it is often easier to implement more complex AI through a combination of programming and use the editor functions to take this a step further. So, it is important to know how AI can be triggered via the editor and how you can customize AI for your game.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec62"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>This chapter covers both animation and artificial intelligence. These are huge topics in game development and there is definitely more to learn about them. I hope that through this chapter, you now have a strong understanding of these two topics and will use your skills to further explore more functions in the Unreal Editor to create cooler stuff.</p><p>We learned a little about the history of animation, how animation is created today in 3D computer games through various 3D modeling software, and finally, how to import this animation into Unreal Engine to be used in games. An animation sequence is the format in which animation is stored/played in Unreal, and you've learned about a simple blend technique to combine different animation sequences.</p><p>Personally, I love how AI contributes to a game. In this chapter, you learned about the different components that make up AI logic. The main AI logic is executed through the Behavior Tree, and we learned how to construct a Behavior Tree in terms of logic as well as how to replicate this into the Unreal Editor itself through the use of BlackBoardData, Task, Composite, and other nodes.</p><p>Ending this chapter, we have covered a huge portion of what we need to create a game. In the next chapter, you will learn how to add sounds and particle effects into a game.</p></div></body></html>
