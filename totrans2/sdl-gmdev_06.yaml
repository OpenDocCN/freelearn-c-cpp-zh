- en: With the previous chapter adding the ability to create and handle game states,
    our framework has really begun to take shape. In this chapter, we will explore
    a new way to create our states and objects by removing the need to hardcode the
    creation of our objects at compile time. To do this we will parse through an external
    file, in our case an XML file, which lists all of the objects needed for our state.
    This will make our states generic as they can be completely different simply by
    loading up an alternate XML file. Taking `PlayState` as an example, when creating
    a new level we would need to create a new state with different objects and set
    up objects we want for that level. If we could instead load the objects from an
    external file, we could reuse the same `PlayState` and simply load the correct
    file depending on the current level we want. Keeping classes generic like this
    and loading external data to determine their state is called **Data-driven Design**.

    terrible solution but also not a particularly good one, as the factory will need
    to know about each type it needs to create and maintaining the switch statement
    for many different objects would be extremely tedious. Just as when we covered
    looping through game objects in [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Working with
    Game Objects"), *Working with Game Objects*, we want this factory not to care
    about which type we ask for. It shouldn't need to know all of the specific types
    we want it to create. Luckily this is something that we can definitely achieve.

    that will create any of our types. Distributed factories allow us to dynamically
    maintain the types of objects we want our factory to create, rather than hard
    code them into a function (like in the preceding simple example). The approach
    we will take is to have the factory contain `std::map` that maps a string (the
    type of our object) to a small class called `Creator` whose only purpose is the
    creation of a specific object. We will register a new type with the factory using
    a function that takes a string (the ID) and a `Creator` class and adds them to
    the factory's map. We are going to start with the base class for all the `Creator`
    types. Create `GameObjectFactory.h` and declare this class at the top of the file.

    the factory's `create` function which would then in turn pass it through to the
    `Creator` object. We have eliminated the need for this by having a specific function
    that handles parsing our loading values. This will make more sense once we start
    parsing our states from a file.
  prefs: []

- en: The texture clearing method is the same as in the previous states, so we will
    leave you to implement that yourself. In fact `onExit` is looking so similar between
    states that it would be a good idea to make a generic implementation for it in
    `GameState` and just use that; again we will leave that to you.

- en: You may have noticed the similarity between the `onEnter` functions. It would
    be great to have a default `onEnter` implementation but, unfortunately, due to
    the need to specify different callback functions, our callback implementation
    will not allow this and this is one of its main flaws.

    `LoaderParams` in its `load` function.

- en: We now have all of our states loading from the XML file and one of the biggest
    benefits of this is that you do not have to recompile the game when you change
    a value. Go ahead and change the XML file to move positions or even use different
    textures for objects; if the XML is saved then you can just run the game again
    and it will use the new values. This is a huge time saver for us and gives us
    complete control over a state without the need to recompile our game.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Loading data from external files is an extremely useful tool in programming
    games. This chapter enabled our game to do this and applied it to all of our existing
    states. We also covered how the use of factories enabled us to create objects
    dynamically at runtime. The next chapter will cover even more data-driven design
    as well as tile maps so that we can really decouple our game and allow it to use
    external sources rather than hardcoded values.
