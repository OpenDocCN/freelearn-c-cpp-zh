This book will help you learn the nitty-gritty of Qt and will equip you with the necessary toolsets to build apps and games. This book is designed as a beginner's guide to take programmers that are new to Qt from the basics, such as objects, core classes, widgets, and so on, and new features in version 5.4, to a level where they can create a custom application with best practices when it comes to programming with Qt.</p><p>With a brief introduction on how to create an application and prepare a working environment for both desktop and mobile platforms, we will dive deeper into the basics of creating graphical interfaces and Qt's core concepts of data processing and display before you try to create a game. As you progress through the chapters, you'll learn to enrich your games by implementing network connectivity and employing scripting. Delve into Qt Quick, OpenGL, and various other tools to add game logic, design animation, add game physics, and build astonishing UIs for games. Toward the end of this book, you'll learn to exploit mobile device features, such as accelerators and sensors, to build engaging user experiences.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Introduction to Qt">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introduction to Qt</em></span>, will familiarize you with the standard behavior that is required when creating cross-platform applications as well as show you a bit of history of Qt and how it evolved over time with an emphasis on the most recent architectural changes in Qt<span class="emphasis"><em>.</em></span>

<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Scripting">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Scripting</em></span>, shows you the benefits of scripting in applications. It will teach you how to employ a scripting engine for a game by using JavaScript. It will also suggest some alternatives to JavaScript for scripting that can be easily integrated with Qt.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Qt Quick Basics">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Qt Quick Basics</em></span>, will teach you to program resolution-independent fluid user interfaces using a QML declarative engine and Qt Quick 2 scene graph environment. In addition, you will learn how to implement new graphical items in your scenes.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Qt Quick">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Qt Quick</em></span>, will show you how to bring dynamics to various aspects of a UI. You will see how to create fancy graphics and animations in Qt Quick by using the particle engine, GLSL shaders and built-in animation, and state machine capabilities, and you will learn how to use these techniques in games.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Chapter 11</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Miscellaneous and Advanced Concepts</em></span>, covers the important aspects of Qt programming that didn't make it into the other chapters but may be important for game programming.
