- en: Video games are getting more and more intricate every day. It seems that innovative
    ideas are on the rise, especially with the increasing popularity of indie games,
    such as *Minecraft* and *Super Meat Boy*. While the game ideas themselves are
    getting more and more abstract, at least on the outside, the rigid skeleton behind
    the pretty skin that keeps it standing and helps it retain shape is still taking
    the place of the lowest common denominator in the eyes of game developers. Even
    if the focus of the game centers around two unicorns who spend their free time
    smoking fairy dust and helping Dracula make muffins so that Neptune doesn't blow
    up, that concept coming to life is going to depend greatly on the underlying logic
    of the game before anything else. If there are no entities in the game, there
    are no unicorns. If the entities are simply bouncing around a black screen, the
    game is not engaging. These are the most common game design elements that any
    project must be able to fall back on, otherwise it is doomed to fail.

    and draw it. Seems simple enough, but consider the following situation: you have
    a map that''s 1000x1000 tiles in size, and perhaps 25% of that map''s size is
    actual tiles that aren''t just air, which leaves you with the total amount of
    62,500 tiles to draw. Now imagine you''re storing a sprite with each tile. Granted,

  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: This `struct` essentially holds everything about every tile type that isn't
    unique. It stores the texture that it's using, as well as the sprite that will
    represent the tile. As you can see, in the constructor of this structure, we set
    the sprite to point to the tile sheet texture and then crop it based on its tile
    ID. This type of cropping is a little different than the one in the sprite sheet
    class, because now we only have the tile ID to work with, and we don't know which
    row the sprite is on. Using some basic math allows us to first figure out how
    many columns and rows the tile sheet has, by dividing our sheet dimensions by
    the tile size. In this case, a 256x256 px sized sprite sheet with tiles of 32x32
    px in size would have eight tiles per row and column. Obtaining the coordinate
    of a tile ID on an *x* axis can be done by using the modulus operator `%`. In
    a case of eight tiles per row, it would return values from 0 to 7, based on the
    ID. Figuring out the *y* coordinate is done simply by dividing the ID by the number
    of tiles per column. This gives us the top-left coordinate of the tile sprite
    in the tile sheet, so we finish the cropping by passing in the `Sheet::Tile_Size`.

    There is a catch though. Let's say that the view of our window is larger than
    the texture of the background. That would result in empty areas all around the
    background, which looks horrendous. Repeating the texture might remedy the empty
    areas, but the specific backgrounds we're going to be working with don't tile
    well, so the best solution is to scale the sprite enough to fit the view space
    fully, whether it's larger or smaller. The factors of the scaling can be obtained
    by multiplying the size of the view by the size of the texture. If, for example,
    we have a view that's 800x600 px large and a texture of a size 400x300 px, the
    scale factor for both axes would be 2 and the background is scaled up to twice
    its size.

    class that acts as a parent to all of its derivatives, which include the player,
    enemies, and perhaps even items, depending on how you want to implement that.
    Having these entirely different concepts share the same roots allows the programmer
    to define types of behavior that are common to all of them. Moreover, it lets
    the game engine act upon them in the same manner, as they all share the same interface.
    For example, the enemy can be pushed, and so can the player. All enemies, items,
    and the player have to be affected by gravity as well. Having that common ancestry
    between these different types allows us to offload a lot of redundant code and

    of the game map is obtained through the shared context. It is then used to obtain
    the gravity of the map, which was loaded from the map file. The entity's acceleration
    is then increased by the gravity on the *y* axis. By using the `AddVelocity` method
    and passing in the acceleration multiplied by delta time, the velocity is adjusted
    and the acceleration is set back to zero. Next, we must obtain the friction coefficient
    that the velocity will be damped by. The `m_referenceTile` data member, if it's
    not set to `nullptr`, is used first, in order to obtain the friction from a tile
    the entity's standing on. If it is set to `nullptr`, the entity must be in mid-air,
    so the default tile from the map is obtained to grab the friction values that
    were loaded from the map file. If that, for whatever reason, is also not set up,
    we default to the value set in the `EntityBase`'s constructor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before we get to calculating friction, it's important to clarify that the `m_speed`
    data member is not set up or initialized in this class, aside from being set to
    a default value. The speed is how much an entity is accelerated when it's moving
    and it will be implemented in one of the derived classes of `EntityBase`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you recall from the constructor of this class, we set up the default friction
    to be 0.8f. That is not just an incredibly small value. We're using friction as
    a factor in order to determine how much of the entity's speed should be lost.
    Having said that, multiplying the speed by a friction coefficient and multiplying
    that by delta time yields us the velocity that is lost during this frame, which
    is then passed into the `ApplyFriction` method in order to manipulate the velocity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, the change in position, called `deltaPos` is calculated by multiplying
    the velocity by delta time, and is passed into the `Move` method to adjust the
    entity's position in the world. The flags for collisions on both axes get reset
    to false and the entity calls its own private members for first obtaining and
    then resolving collisions.

    There is another intersection check here between the bounding box of the entity
    and the tile. This is done because resolving a previous collision could have moved
    an entity in such a way that it is no longer colliding with the next tile in the
    container. If there still is a collision, distances from the center of the entity's
    bounding box to the center of the tile's bounding box are calculated. The first
    purpose these distances serve is illustrated in the next line, where their absolute
    values get compared. If the distance on the x axis is bigger than on the y axis,
    the resolution takes place on the x axis. Otherwise, it's resolved on the y axis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the tile the entity is on. If the distance is positive, the entity is on the right
    side of the tile, so it gets moved in the positive x direction. Otherwise, it
    gets moved in the negative x direction. The *resolve* variable takes in the amount
    of penetration between the tile and the entity, which is different based on the
    axis and the side of the collision.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    passing in the depth of penetration. Killing the entity's velocity on that axis
    is also important, in order to simulate the entity hitting a solid. Lastly, the
    flag for a collision on a specific axis is set to true.

    order to keep the reference unchanged until the next time collisions are checked.

    need to loop, like the attack or hurt animation. The fact that they do not loop
    and are stopped when they reach the end frame gives us a hook to manipulate what

    state depends on it. Then, we check if the width and height of the attack bounding
    box aren't still at 0, which are the default values for them. If they aren't,
    it means the attack bounding box has been set up and can be updated. The rest
    of the update method pretty much just handles state transitions. If the entity
    isn't dying, attacking something, or taking damage, its current state is going
    to be determined by its velocity. In order to accurately depict an entity falling,
    we have to make the velocity on y axis take precedence over everything else. If
    the entity has no vertical velocity, it's checked for horizontal velocity instead
    and sets the state to `Walking` if the velocity is higher than the specified minimum.
    Using small values instead of absolute zero takes care of problems with animations
    being jittery sometimes.

    sheet animation is checked in order to see if it is still playing. If it isn't,
    the state is switched back to idle. Lastly, if the entity is dying and the dying
    animation is finished playing, we call the `Remove` method of our entity manager
    in order to remove this entity from the world.

    the attack region that is colliding with another entity. If it is and the player
    is in the attack state, we check if the attack animation in the sprite sheet is
    currently "in action." If the current frame is within range of the beginning and
    end frames when the action is supposed to happen, the last check is made to determine
    if the entity is either a player or an enemy. Finally, if it is one or the other,
    the opponent gets hit with a pre-determined damage value, and based on its position
    will have some velocity added to it for a knock-back effect. That's about as basic
    a game design as it gets.

    simple attempt at adding basic artificial intelligence to the game. All it will
    do is keep track of a destination position, which the `Update` method will randomize

    its attack region. Also, we ignore every single collision, unless it's colliding
    with a player entity, in which case the enemy's state is set to `Attacking` in
    order to display the attack animation. It inflicts damage of *1* point to the
    player and knocks them back just a little bit based on where the entity is. The
    sprite-sheet direction is also set based on the position of the enemy entity relative

    its update method first before doing anything. Then the most basic simulation
    of A.I. begins by first checking if the entity has a destination. If it does not,
    a random number is generated between 1 and 1000\. It has a 1/1000 chance to have
    its destination set to be anywhere within 128 pixels of its current position.
    The direction is decided by another random number generation, except much smaller
    this time. The destination finally is set and gets checked for being outside the
    world boundaries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If, on the other hand, the entity does have a destination, the distance between
    it and its current position is checked. If it is above 16, the appropriate method
    for moving in a specific direction is called, based on which direction the destination
    point is in. We must also check for horizontal collisions, because an enemy entity
    could easily be assigned a destination that's beyond a tile it cannot cross. If
    that happens, the destination is simply taken away.

    use the shared context to obtain the render window, which will be using the updated
    view. Now, we have an issue of the screen leaving the boundaries of the map, which
    can be resolved by checking the top-left corner of the view space. If it's below
    or equal to zero, we set the view's centre on the x axis to a position that would
    put its top-left corner at the very edge of the screen, in order to prevent scrolling
    infinitely to the left. If, however, the view is outside of the map in the opposite
    direction, the view centre's x coordinate is set up so that the right side of
    it is also at the very edge of the map's boundaries.
