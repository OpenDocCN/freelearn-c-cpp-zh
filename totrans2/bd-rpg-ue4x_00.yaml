- en: Now that Unreal Engine 4 has become one of the most cutting-edge game engines
    in the world, developers both AAA and Indie alike are looking for the best ways
    of creating games of any genre using the engine. Upon Unreal's first release,
    it was known as a great first-person shooter game engine, but with the success
    of games such as WB's *Mortal Kombat*, Chair Entertainment's *Shadow Complex*,
    and Epic Games' *Gears of War*, along with highly anticipated upcoming games such
    as Capcom's *Street Fighter 5*, Comcept's *Mighty No. 9*, and Square Enix's *Final
    Fantasy VII Remake*, Unreal has proven itself to be one of the greatest engines
    to use when creating virtually any genre of game. This book will lay the foundations
    of creating a turn-based RPG in Unreal Engine 4.
