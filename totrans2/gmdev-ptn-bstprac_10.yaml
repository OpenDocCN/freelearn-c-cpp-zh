    *Improving Performance with Object Pools*, and that they are great for avoiding
    slowdowns in our game due to dynamic memory allocation. But, there are still other
    steps that we can take to reduce the amount of memory that we use to begin with.

    objects on the screen at once. While computers have become much more powerful
    over the past few years, they still can't handle thousands of complex game objects
    on the screen by themselves.

    the memory load on their program. Using the Flyweight pattern, we abstract the
    common parts of our object and share them with only the data that's unique to
    each instance (such as position and current health) being created.

    2D sprites or simple 3D models that are created in order to simulate *fuzzy* things
    such as fires, explosions, and smoke trails to add visual flair to your projects.
    This visual flair is sometimes referred to as *juiciness*. Made popular by indie
    developers *Martin Jonasson* and *Petri Purho*, making a game *juicy* makes it
    more enjoyable to play and increases the feedback the player receives by playing
    the game.

    on some computers, but note that a large number of the variables that we have
    created hold data that will never change once we've initialized them. Now, generally
    in programming we would mark a variable that wouldn't change as `const`, but we
    don't set the variable until we read from a file. We could potentially make the
    variables static, but there's also the chance that we may want to have more particle
    systems in the future and I don't want to create an archetype for each one.

    had one particle system, but we may want the ability to have more as well, and
    it's when we start using it that some of the benefits of the Flyweight pattern
    become even more apparent. That's why we gave this class two virtual functions: `Init`
    and `Update`. We can have our extrinsic state call these functions, giving the
    function information about the particular object we're dealing with, and then
    we can modify it using these properties.
