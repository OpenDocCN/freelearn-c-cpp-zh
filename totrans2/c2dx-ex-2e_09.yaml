    stays out of memory after its first instantiation, therefore speeding up the time
    from level selection to the actual playing. This may not work for every game,
    however. As I mentioned earlier, when transitioning between scenes, both scenes
    stay in memory for a few seconds. But here we are adding to that problem by keeping
    one layer in memory the whole time. Eskimo, however, is not very big memory-wise.
    Note that we could still have the option of creating special conditions for when
    `GameLayer` should be destroyed, and conditions when it should not.'

    objects will listen to this defined message, and when such a message is dispatched,
    every `Platform` object will call the `onGravityChanged` method. This method does
    not need to be a block as I showed here, but it is more readable to have the handler
    appear as close to the `Add Listener` call as possible. So, simple blocks are
    a good way to organize listeners and their handlers.

    to keep values within a certain range. You can also find a variety of formulas

    to be or how responsive.
