We will learn about:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Getting familiar with Blueprint editor</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Various Blueprint graph types (for example, function graphs, event graphs, and so on)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Blueprint nodes</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">And, finally, we will create a simple Blueprint that can be placed in world or dynamically spawned while running the game</li></ul></div><p>Blueprint Visual Scripting in Unreal Engine 4 is an extremely powerful and flexible node-based interface to create gameplay elements and provides artists and designers with the ability to program their <a id="id231" class="indexterm"/>game and to quickly iterate gameplay within the editor without writing a single line of code! Using Blueprints you can create and tweak gameplay, characters, inputs, environments, and virtually anything in your game.</p><p>Blueprints work by using graphs that contain various nodes connected to each other, which defines what the Blueprint does. For example, it can be gameplay events, spawning new Actors, or anything really.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec29"/>Different Blueprint types</h1></div></div></div><p>Let's take a quick look at various Blueprint types that are<a id="id232" class="indexterm"/> available in Unreal Engine 4:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Level Blueprint</strong>: Level Blueprint is a special Blueprint that acts as a level-wide global event graph, which the user can neither remove nor create. Each level will have its own level <a id="id233" class="indexterm"/>Blueprint that the user can use to create events that pertain to the whole level. The user can use this graph to call events on a specific actor present in the level or play a Matinee sequence. Users who are familiar with Unreal Engine 3 (or UDK) should be familiar with this concept as this is similar to how Kismet worked in those Engines.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Class Blueprint</strong>: Commonly referred to as just Blueprint, is an asset that you create inside <strong>Content Browser</strong>. Once the asset is created, you define its behavior visually instead<a id="id234" class="indexterm"/> of typing any code. This Blueprint is saved as an asset in <strong>Content Browser</strong> so you can drag and drop this into your world as an instance or spawn dynamically in another Blueprint graph.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Animation Blueprint</strong>: These <a id="id235" class="indexterm"/>are specialized graphs that control the animation of a skeletal mesh by blending animations, controlling the bones directly, and outputting a final pose in each frame. Animation Blueprints will always have two graphs, namely <strong>EventGraph</strong> and <strong>AnimGraph</strong>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>EventGraph</strong>: This uses a <a id="id236" class="indexterm"/>collection of animation-related events to initiate a sequence of nodes, which updates the values used to drive animations within <strong>Animgraph</strong>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>AnimGraph</strong>: This is used to <a id="id237" class="indexterm"/>evaluate the final pose for your <strong>Skeletal Mesh</strong>. In this graph, you can perform animation blends or control bone transforms using <strong>SkeletalControls</strong>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Macro Library</strong>: These are<a id="id238" class="indexterm"/> containers that can hold various macros or graphs that you can use multiple times in any other Blueprint class. Macro libraries cannot contain variables or inherit from other Blueprints or be placed in the level. They are just a collection of graphs that you use commonly and can be a time-saver. If you are referencing a macro in your Blueprint then changes to that macro will not be applied to your Blueprint until you recompile your Blueprint. Compiling a Blueprint means converting all the properties and graphs into a class that Unreal can use.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Blueprint Interface</strong>: These are <a id="id239" class="indexterm"/>graphs that contain one or more functions without implementation. Other classes that add this interface must include the functions in a unique manner. This has the same concept of interface in programming where you can access various objects with a common interface and share or send data to one another. Interface graphs have some limitations in that you cannot create variables, edit graphs, or add any components.</li></ul></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec30"/>Getting familiar with the Blueprint user interface</h1></div></div></div><p>The Blueprint <strong>User Interface</strong> (<strong>UI</strong>) contains<a id="id240" class="indexterm"/> various tabs by default. In the following<a id="id241" class="indexterm"/> screenshot you can see the unified layout of the Blueprint UI:</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_01.jpg" alt="Getting familiar with the Blueprint user interface"/></div><p>Let's take a look at these tabs:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Components</strong></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>My Blueprint</strong></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Toolbar</strong></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Graph editor</strong></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Details panel</strong></li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec54"/>Components tab</h2></div></div></div><p>Most Blueprint classes can have <a id="id242" class="indexterm"/>different types of components. These can be light components, mesh components, UI components, and <a id="id243" class="indexterm"/>so on. In this section, we will see what they are and how we can use them in our Blueprint classes.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec17"/>What are components?</h3></div></div></div><p>Components are the bits and pieces that make up the whole Actor. Components cannot exist on their own but when added to an Actor, the Actor will then have access to all the functionalities provided by the <a id="id244" class="indexterm"/>component. For example, think about a car. The wheels, body, lights, and so on can be considered as components and the car itself as the Actor. Then in the graph, you can access the component and do the logic for your car Actor. Components are always instanced and each Actor instance will have its own unique instance of components. If this were not the case, then, if we place multiple car Actors in world and if one starts moving, all the others will also move.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec18"/>Adding a component</h3></div></div></div><p>To add a component to <a id="id245" class="indexterm"/>your Actor, click the <strong>Add Component</strong> button on the <strong>Components</strong> tab. After clicking the button it will show a list of various <strong>Components</strong> that you can add.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_02.jpg" alt="Adding a component"/></div><p>After adding a component, you<a id="id246" class="indexterm"/> will be prompted to give it a name. Components can also be directly added simply by dragging-and-dropping from <strong>Content Browser</strong> to the <strong>Components</strong> window.</p><p>To rename a component, you can select it in the <strong>Components</strong> tab and press <em>F2</em>.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note17"/>Note</h3><p>The drag-and-drop method only applies to <strong>StaticMeshes</strong>, <strong>SkeletalMeshes</strong>, <strong>SoundCues</strong>, and <strong>ParticleSystems</strong>.</p></div></div><p>With the component selected, you can delete it by pressing the <em>Delete</em> key. You can also right-click on the component and select <strong>Delete</strong> to remove it as well.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec19"/>Transforming the component</h3></div></div></div><p>Once the component is<a id="id247" class="indexterm"/> added and selected, you can use the transform tools (<em>W</em>, <em>E</em>, and <em>R</em>) to change the location, rotation, and scale of the component either by entering values in the <strong>Details</strong> panel or in the <strong>Viewport</strong> tab. When using moving, rotating, or scaling, you can press <em>Shift</em> to enable snapping, provided you have enabled grid snapping in the <strong>Viewport</strong> toolbar.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note18"/>Note</h3><p>If the Component has any child components attached to it then moving, rotating or scaling that component will propagate the transformation to all child components too.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec20"/>Adding events for components</h3></div></div></div><p>Adding events based on a<a id="id248" class="indexterm"/> component is very easy and can be done by different methods. Events created in this manner are specific to that component and need not be tested as to which component is involved:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Adding events from the details panel</strong>: When you select the component you will see all the events available for that component in the <strong>Details</strong> panel as buttons. When you <a id="id249" class="indexterm"/>click on any of them, the editor will create the event node specific for that component in the event graph.<div><img src="img/B03950_06_03.jpg" alt="Adding events for components"/></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Adding events by right-clicking</strong>: When you right-click on a component, you will see <strong>Add Event</strong> in the <a id="id250" class="indexterm"/>context menu. From there you can select any event you want and editor will create the event node specific to that component in the event graph.<div><img src="img/B03950_06_04.jpg" alt="Adding events for components"/></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Adding events in the graph</strong>: Once you select your component in the <strong>My Blueprints</strong> tab, you can<a id="id251" class="indexterm"/> right-click on the graph and get all the <strong>Events</strong> for that component.<div><img src="img/B03950_06_05.jpg" alt="Adding events for components"/></div></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec55"/>My Blueprints tab</h2></div></div></div><p>The <strong>My Blueprints</strong> tab displays a list of <strong>Graphs</strong>, <strong>Functions</strong>, <strong>Macros</strong>, <strong>Variables</strong>, and so on that are contained within <a id="id252" class="indexterm"/>your Blueprint. This tab is dependent on the type of Blueprint. For example, a class Blueprint will have <strong>EventGraph</strong>, <strong>ConstructionScript Graph</strong>, <strong>Variables</strong>, <strong>Functions</strong>, <strong>Macros</strong>, and so on. An interface <a id="id253" class="indexterm"/>will only show the list of functions within it. A <strong>Macro Library</strong> will show only the macros created within it.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec21"/>Creation buttons</h3></div></div></div><p>You can create new <a id="id254" class="indexterm"/>variables, functions, macros, event graphs, and event dispatchers inside the <strong>My Blueprints</strong> tab by clicking the shortcut button (<strong>+</strong>).</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_06.jpg" alt="Creation buttons"/></div><p>You can also add them<a id="id255" class="indexterm"/> by clicking the <strong>+Add New</strong> drop-down button.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec22"/>Searching in my Blueprint</h3></div></div></div><p>The <strong>My Blueprint</strong> tab also provides a search area to search for your variables, functions, macros, event graphs, and event <a id="id256" class="indexterm"/>dispatchers. You can search based on name, comment, or any other data.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec23"/>Categorizing in My Blueprint</h3></div></div></div><p>It is always a good practice to<a id="id257" class="indexterm"/> organize your variables, functions, macros, event dispatchers, and so on into various categories. In the <strong>My Blueprints</strong> tab, you can have as many categories with sub-categories. Check the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_07.jpg" alt="Categorizing in My Blueprint"/></div><p>Here you can see how I have organized everything into various categories and sub-categories. To set a category for your variables, functions, macros, and event dispatchers, simply select them <a id="id258" class="indexterm"/>and in the <strong>Details</strong> panel you can type your new category name or select from an existing category. If you need sub-categories then you need to separate your sub-category name with a vertical bar key (<strong>|</strong>). For example, if you want <strong>Health</strong> as a sub-category in <strong>Attributes</strong>, you can set it like this: <strong>Attributes</strong> | <strong>Health</strong>.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec56"/>Toolbar</h2></div></div></div><p>The toolbar provides access to common commands required while editing Blueprints. Toolbar buttons will be <a id="id259" class="indexterm"/>different depending on which mode (editing mode, play in editor mode, and so on) is active and which Blueprint type <a id="id260" class="indexterm"/>you are currently editing.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec57"/>Graph editor</h2></div></div></div><p>Graph editor is the main area of <a id="id261" class="indexterm"/>your Blueprint. This is where you<a id="id262" class="indexterm"/> add new nodes and connect them to create the network that defines the scripted behavior. More information on how to create new nodes and various nodes will be explained later on in this book.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec58"/>Details panel</h2></div></div></div><p>The <strong>Details</strong> panel provides<a id="id263" class="indexterm"/> access to properties of the <a id="id264" class="indexterm"/>selected <strong>Components</strong> or <strong>Variables</strong>. It contains a search field so you can search for a specific property.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec31"/>Blueprint graph types</h1></div></div></div><p>As we mentioned before, Blueprints are assets that are saved in <strong>Content Browser</strong> that are used to create new types of Actors or script gameplay logic, events, and so on, giving both designers and <a id="id265" class="indexterm"/>programmers the ability to quickly iterate gameplay without writing a single line of code. In order for a Blueprint to have scripted behavior, we need to define how it behaves using various nodes in graph editor. Let's take a quick look at various graphs:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Construction Script Graph</strong>: Construction graph is executed the moment the Blueprint is initialized<a id="id266" class="indexterm"/> and whenever a change happens to any variables within the Blueprint. This means that whenever you place an instance of the Blueprint in the level and <a id="id267" class="indexterm"/>change its transformation or any variable, the construction graph is executed. This graph is executed once every time it is constructed and again when any of the properties or Blueprint is updated. This can be used to construct procedural elements or to set up values before the game begins.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Event Graph</strong>: This is <a id="id268" class="indexterm"/>where all the gameplay logic is contained, including<a id="id269" class="indexterm"/> interactivity and dynamic responses. Using various event nodes as entry points to functions, flow controls, and variables, you can script the behavior of the Blueprint. Event graphs are only executed when you start the game.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Function Graph</strong>: By default, this graph contains one single entry point with the name of the function. This node <a id="id270" class="indexterm"/>can never be deleted but you can move it around freely. Nodes in this graph are only executed when you call this function in the construction<a id="id271" class="indexterm"/> or event graph or from another Blueprint that is referencing the Blueprint that this function belongs to.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Macro Graph</strong>: This is like a<a id="id272" class="indexterm"/> collapsed graph that contains <a id="id273" class="indexterm"/>your nodes. Unlike function graphs, macros can have multiple inputs or outputs.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Interface Graph</strong>: Interface graphs are<a id="id274" class="indexterm"/> disabled and you<a id="id275" class="indexterm"/> cannot move, create graphs, variables, or components.</li></ul></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note19"/>Note</h3><p>Only class Blueprints have <strong>Construction Script</strong> and it stops executing when gameplay begins and is considered completed before gameplay.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec59"/>Function graph</h2></div></div></div><p>Function graphs are node graphs created inside a Blueprint and can be executed from another graph (such as <strong>Event Graph</strong> or <strong>Construction Script</strong>) or from another Blueprint. By default, function graphs contain a single <a id="id276" class="indexterm"/>execution pin that is<a id="id277" class="indexterm"/> activated when the function is called, causing the connected nodes to execute.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec24"/>Creating functions</h3></div></div></div><p>Function graphs are<a id="id278" class="indexterm"/> created through <strong>My Blueprints</strong> tab and you can create as many functions as you want.</p><p>Inside <strong>My Blueprints</strong> tab you can hover your mouse over the functions header and click on <strong>+Function</strong> to add a new function</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_08.jpg" alt="Creating functions"/></div><p>Clicking that button (the yellow highlighted button) will create a new function and prompts you to enter a<a id="id279" class="indexterm"/> new name for it.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec25"/>Graph settings</h3></div></div></div><p>When you create<a id="id280" class="indexterm"/> a new function and select it, you will get some properties of that function, which you can change in the <strong>Details</strong> panel. Let's take a quick look at them.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_09.jpg" alt="Graph settings"/></div><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Description</strong>: Appears as a tooltip when you hover your mouse over this function in another graph.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Category</strong>: Keeps this function in its given category (for organizational purpose only).</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Access Specifier</strong>: Sometimes when you create functions, you don't want to access some of them in another Blueprint. Access specifiers let you specify what other objects can access this function.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Public</strong>: This means any object can access this function from anywhere. This is the default setting.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Protected</strong>: This means current Blueprint and any Blueprints derived from the current Blueprint can access this function.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Private</strong>: This setting<a id="id281" class="indexterm"/> means only the current Blueprint can access this function.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Pure</strong>: When enabled, this function is marked as a <strong>Pure Function</strong> and when disabled it is an <strong>Impure Function</strong>.<div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Pure Function</strong> will not modify state or members of a class in any way and is considered a <strong>Constant Function</strong> that only outputs a data value and does not have an execution pin. These are connected to other <strong>Data Pins</strong> and are automatically executed when the data on them is required.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Impure Function</strong> is free to modify any value in a class and contains an execution pin.</li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>The following is a screenshot showing the difference between <strong>Pure Function</strong> and <strong>Impure Function</strong>:</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_10.jpg" alt="Graph settings"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec26"/>Editing functions</h3></div></div></div><p>To define the functionality<a id="id282" class="indexterm"/> of the function you need to edit it. You can have as many inputs or outputs as you want, and can then create a node network between those inputs and outputs to define the functionality. To add input or output, you first need to select the function either in the <strong>My Blueprint</strong> tab or select the main pink node when you open the <strong>Function Graph</strong>. Then, in the <strong>Details</strong> panel, you will see a button labelled <strong>New</strong> that creates new inputs or outputs.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_11.jpg" alt="Editing functions"/></div><p>In this screenshot you can see how I added new inputs and outputs to <strong>Function Example</strong>.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note20"/>Note</h3><p>
<strong>ReturnNode</strong> is optional and will only appear if you have at least one output data pin. If you remove all output pins then <strong>ReturnNode</strong> is automatically removed and you can still use your function.</p></div></div><p>For example, in the<a id="id283" class="indexterm"/> following screenshot I created a Blueprint function that appends a prefix to my character name so I can use this one single function to change the prefix anytime I want.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_12.jpg" alt="Editing functions"/></div><p>Now, back in <strong>Event Graph</strong>, I call this function on the <strong>Begin Play</strong> event so I can set the character name when the<a id="id284" class="indexterm"/> game starts.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_13.jpg" alt="Editing functions"/></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec60"/>Macro graph</h2></div></div></div><p>Macro graphs are essentially collapsed graphs of nodes, which contain an entry point and exit point designated by<a id="id285" class="indexterm"/> tunnel nodes but cannot contain variables. Macro graphs can have any number of execution or data pins.</p><p>Macros can be created inside<a id="id286" class="indexterm"/> a <strong>Class Blueprint</strong> or <strong>Level Blueprint</strong> like functions or you can organize your <strong>Macros</strong> in a <strong>Blueprint Macro Library</strong>, which can be created in <strong>Content Browser</strong>.</p><p>
<strong>Blueprint Macro Library</strong> can contain all your <strong>Macros</strong> in one place so you can use them in any other Blueprint. These can be real time-savers as they can contain most commonly used nodes and can transfer data. But changes to a macro graph are only reflected when the Blueprint containing that macro is recompiled.</p><p>To create a macro library you need to right-click in <strong>Content Browser</strong> and select <strong>Blueprint Macro Library</strong> from the Blueprints sub-category.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_14.jpg" alt="Macro graph"/></div><p>Once you select that option you have to select a parent class for your Macro. Most of the time we select Actor as the parent class. After the selection, you will be prompted to type a name for your Macro library and save it.</p><p>If you just created your Macro<a id="id287" class="indexterm"/> library, the editor will create a blank Macro named <strong>NewMacro_0</strong> and will be highlighted for you to rename.</p><p>As you did with functions, you <a id="id288" class="indexterm"/>can type a description and define a <strong>Category</strong> for your Macro. You also get an option to define a color for your Macro using <strong>Instance Color</strong>.</p><p>In the following screenshot you can see I created a Macro with multiple outputs and defined a <strong>Description</strong>, <strong>Category</strong>, and <a id="id289" class="indexterm"/>an <strong>Instance Color</strong> for the Macro:</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_15.jpg" alt="Macro graph"/></div><p>In any other Blueprint I can<a id="id290" class="indexterm"/> now get this Macro and use it. If you hover you mouse over the Macro, you can see the description you set as a <strong>Tooltip</strong>.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_16.jpg" alt="Macro graph"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec61"/>Interface graph</h2></div></div></div><p>Interface graphs are a collection of functions without any implementation, which can be added to other Blueprints. Any Blueprint class implementing an interface will definitely contain all the functions from<a id="id291" class="indexterm"/> the interface. It is then up to the user to give functionality to the functions in that interface. Interface editor is similar to other Blueprints but you cannot add new variables, edit the graph, or add <a id="id292" class="indexterm"/>any components.</p><p>Interfaces are used to communicate between various Blueprints that share specific functionality. For example, if the player is having a <strong>Flame Thrower</strong> gun and in the game you have <strong>Ice</strong> and <strong>Cloth</strong>, both can take damage but one should melt and the other should burn. You can create a <strong>Blueprint Interface</strong> that contains a <strong>TakeWeaponFire</strong> function and have <strong>Ice</strong> and <strong>Cloth</strong> implement this interface. Then, in <strong>Ice Blueprint</strong>, you can implement the <strong>TakeWeaponFire</strong> function and make the ice melt and, in <strong>Cloth Blueprint</strong>, you can implement that same function and make the cloth burn. Now when you are firing your <strong>Flame Thrower</strong> you can simply call the <strong>TakeWeaponFire</strong> function and it calls them in those Blueprints.</p><p>To create a new interface, you<a id="id293" class="indexterm"/> need to right-click on the <strong>Content Browser</strong> and select <strong>Blueprint Interface</strong> from the Blueprints sub-category and then<a id="id294" class="indexterm"/> name it.</p><p>In the following example I named it <strong>BP_TestInterface</strong>:</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_17.jpg" alt="Interface graph"/></div><p>If you just created your interface the editor will create a blank function named <strong>NewFunction_0</strong>, which will be highlighted for you to rename. If you implement this interface on any Blueprint then it will have this function.</p><p>In this example, I <a id="id295" class="indexterm"/>created a function called <strong>MyInterfaceFunction</strong>. We will use this to simply print out the Actor<a id="id296" class="indexterm"/> name that implements this interface.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_18.jpg" alt="Interface graph"/></div><p>To create functionality for this function, we first need to implement this interface in a Blueprint. So open your Blueprint where you want this to be implemented and select <strong>Class Settings</strong> in the <strong>Toolbar</strong>.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_19.jpg" alt="Interface graph"/></div><p>Now the <strong>Details</strong> panel will show the settings for this Blueprint and, under the <strong>Interfaces</strong> section, you can add your interface.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_20.jpg" alt="Interface graph"/></div><p>Once you add that<a id="id297" class="indexterm"/> interface, the <strong>My Blueprints</strong> tab will update to<a id="id298" class="indexterm"/> show you the interface functions. Now all you have to do is double-click on the function to open the graph and add functionality.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_21.jpg" alt="Interface graph"/></div><p>The reason why <strong>MyInterfaceFunction</strong> appears in the <strong>My Blueprints</strong> tab is because that function contains an output <a id="id299" class="indexterm"/>value. If you have an interface function <a id="id300" class="indexterm"/>without an output then it won't appear in the <strong>My Blueprints</strong> tab. Instead it appears under <strong>Events</strong> when right-clicking in your Blueprint. For example, in that same interface I created another function without output data.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_22.jpg" alt="Interface graph"/></div><p>This <strong>AnotherInterfaceFunction</strong> will not appear in the <strong>My Blueprints</strong> tab because it has no output. So, to implement this<a id="id301" class="indexterm"/> function in your Blueprint, you have<a id="id302" class="indexterm"/> to add this as an event.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_23.jpg" alt="Interface graph"/></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec32"/>Blueprint node references</h1></div></div></div><p>The behavior of a Blueprint object is<a id="id303" class="indexterm"/> defined using various nodes. Nodes can be <strong>Events</strong>, <strong>Function Calls</strong>, <strong>Flow Control</strong>, <strong>Variables</strong>, and so on that are used in the graph. Even though each type of node has a unique function, the way they are created and used is common.</p><p>Nodes are added to the<a id="id304" class="indexterm"/> graph by right-clicking inside the graph panel and selecting the node from the <strong>Context Menu</strong>. If a component inside Blueprint is selected, events and functions supported by that component are also listed.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_24.jpg" alt="Blueprint node references"/></div><p>After a node is added you can select it and move it around using the left mouse button. You can use <em>Ctrl</em> to add or remove from the current selection of nodes. Clicking and dragging inside the graph creates a <strong>Marquee Selection</strong> that adds to the current selection.</p><p>Nodes can have multiple inputs and outputs and are of two types: <strong>Execution Pins</strong> and <strong>Data Pins</strong>.</p><p>Execution pins start the flow of execution and when the execution is completed it activates an output execution pin to continue the flow. Execution pins are drawn as outlines when not wired and solid white when connected.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_25.jpg" alt="Blueprint node references"/></div><p>Data pins are nodes that transfer (such as taking and outputting) data from one node to the other. These nodes are type <a id="id305" class="indexterm"/>specific. That means they can be connected to variables of the same type. Some data pins are automatically converted if you connect them to another data pin that is not of the same type. For example, if you connect a <code class="literal">float</code> variable to <code class="literal">string</code>, the Blueprint editor will automatically insert a <code class="literal">float</code> to a <code class="literal">string</code> conversion node. Like execution pins, they are drawn as an outline when not connected, and a solid color when connected.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_26.jpg" alt="Blueprint node references"/></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec62"/>Node colors</h2></div></div></div><p>Nodes in Blueprint have different <a id="id306" class="indexterm"/>colors that show what kind of node it is.</p><p>A red-colored node means it's an event node and this is where execution starts.</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_27.jpg" alt="Node colors"/></div><p>A blue-colored node means it can either be a function or an event being called.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec33"/>Creating our first Blueprint class</h1></div></div></div><p>Now that we have an idea of what <a id="id313" class="indexterm"/>Blueprint is and what it does, let's create a simple Blueprint actor that spins on its own and destroys itself after a few seconds with a particle effect and sound. After creating our Blueprint, we will drag and drop this into the world and we will also use the <strong>Level Blueprint</strong> to dynamically spawn this Blueprint while running the game.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec65"/>Creating a new Blueprint</h2></div></div></div><p>To create this Blueprint, first right-click inside <strong>Content Browser</strong> and select <strong>Blueprint Class</strong>. Once you click<a id="id314" class="indexterm"/> that you will be prompted to select a parent class for the Blueprint. You need to specify a parent class for your Blueprint as it will inherit all properties from that parent class.</p><p>Even though you can choose all existing classes (even other Blueprint classes), let's take a look at the most <a id="id315" class="indexterm"/>common parent classes:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Actor</strong>: An Actor-based Blueprint can be placed or spawned in the level</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Pawn</strong>: <strong>Pawn</strong> is what you can call an agent which you can possess and receives inputs from the controller</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Character</strong>: This is an extended version of <strong>Pawn</strong> with the ability to walk, run, jump, crouch, and more</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Player Controller</strong>: This is used to control the <strong>Character</strong> or <strong>Pawn</strong></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Game Mode</strong>: This defines the game being played</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Actor Component</strong>: This is a reusable component that can be added to any actor</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Scene Component</strong>: This is a component with scene transform and can be attached to other scene components</li></ul></div><p>In this example, we will use the <strong>Actor</strong> class as our parent because we want to place it in the level and spawn at runtime. So choose <strong>Actor</strong> class and Unreal will create and place your new Blueprint in <strong>Content Browser</strong>. Double-click on your newly created Blueprint and this will open the Blueprint editor. By default, it should open the <strong>Viewport</strong> tab but if it doesn't then simply select the <strong>Viewport</strong> tab. This is where you can see and manipulate all of your components.</p><p>Now we need a component that will spin when this Blueprint is spawned. On the <strong>Components</strong> tab, click <strong>Add Component</strong> and select <strong>Static Mesh</strong> component. After you add the component, rename it to <strong>Mesh Component</strong> (you can choose whatever name you want but, for this example, let's choose that name) and note how the <strong>Details</strong> panel has been populated with <strong>Static Mesh</strong> properties.</p><p>In the <strong>Details</strong> panel, you can find the section that corresponds to your component type where you can assign the asset to use.</p><p>But, in this example, instead of <a id="id316" class="indexterm"/>directly assigning a mesh in the <strong>Components</strong> tab, we <a id="id317" class="indexterm"/> create a <strong>Static Mesh</strong> variable and use that to assign the mesh in the graph. This way, we can change the mesh without opening the Blueprint editor.</p><p>In the <strong>My Blueprints</strong> tab, create a new variable and set the type to <strong>Static Mesh</strong> (make sure to select <strong>reference</strong>).</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip21"/>Tip</h3><p>In versions before Unreal Engine 4.9, you can search for <strong>Static Mesh</strong> and simply select the reference. There was no additional options to select before 4.9.</p></div></div><p>After that, rename that variable to <strong>My Mesh</strong>. Since this variable is used to assign the asset to use with our <strong>Static Mesh</strong> component, let's expose this variable so that we can change it in the <strong>Details</strong> panel after placing it in world. To expose this variable, select it and enable <strong>Editable</strong> in the <strong>Details</strong> panel inside the Blueprint editor. After making it editable, compile the Blueprint (shortcut key: <em>F7</em>) and you will be able to assign a default mesh for the <strong>My Mesh</strong> variable. For this example, let's add a simple cube <strong>Static Mesh</strong>.</p><p>Now that our variable is set, we can assign it to our <strong>Static Mesh</strong> component. Since we know that <strong>Construction Graph</strong> is executed every time this Blueprint is initialized and whenever a variable or property is changed, that is where we are going to assign the mesh for our <strong>Static Mesh</strong> component. So, open the <strong>Construction Graph</strong> and:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Right-click on the graph editor and search for the <strong>Get Mesh</strong> component.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Select <strong>Get Mesh</strong> component from the context menu.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Click and drag from the output pin and release it.

From this point, feel free to drag this Blueprint to the world and in the <strong>Details</strong> panel you can change <strong>My Mesh</strong> to any other <strong>Static Mesh</strong>.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip22"/>Tip</h3><p>Press <em>Ctrl</em>+<em>E</em> to open the associated editor of the object you have selected in world.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec66"/>Spinning static mesh</h2></div></div></div><p>In Blueprint editor, there are a couple of ways to rotate a mesh and in this section we will look into the simplest way, which is using a <strong>Rotate Movement</strong> component.</p><p>Open the Blueprint if you have<a id="id319" class="indexterm"/> closed it and add a new component called <strong>Rotating Movement</strong>. This component will make this Actor continuously rotate at a given rotation rate optionally around a specified point. This component has three main parameters that can be changed in the Blueprint graph. They are:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Rotation Rate</strong>: The speed at which this will update the <strong>Roll</strong>/<strong>Pitch</strong>/<strong>Yaw</strong> axis.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Pivot Translation</strong>: The pivot point at which we rotate. If set to zero then we rotate around the object's origin.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Rotation in Local Space</strong>: Whether rotation is applied in local space or world space.</li></ul></div><p>You can create two new variables (<strong>Rotator</strong> and <strong>Vector</strong> variables) and make them editable so you can change it in the <strong>Details</strong> panel in world. The final graph should look like this:</p><div><img src="img/B03950_06_35.jpg" alt="Spinning static mesh"/></div></div></div>
