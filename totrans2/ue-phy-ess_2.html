Imagine you drop a dice. Based on the reality of the physical rules in the world we live, the dice drops differently on wood, stone, glass, and carpet. The same can be said for glass, plastic ball, and enemy body (more complex). Using PhAT, you will learn how to simulate reality based on the physical rules that exist in the game world. This is kind of animated, but with more logics and tools.</p><p>In this chapter, you will first learn about the most important items in PhAT and then use them in a practical example.</p><div class="section" title="Navigating to PhAT"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec27"/>Navigating to PhAT</h1></div></div></div><p>Before we <a id="id87" class="indexterm"/>start working in <span class="strong"><strong>Unreal Editor</strong></span>, we will need to have a project to work with. Perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">First, open <span class="strong"><strong>Unreal Editor</strong></span> by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Launch</strong></span> button from Unreal Engine Launcher.</li><li class="listitem">Start a new project from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> browser by selecting the <span class="strong"><strong>New Project</strong></span> tab. Then, select <span class="strong"><strong>Third Person</strong></span> and make sure that <span class="strong"><strong>With Starter Content</strong></span> is selected. Give the project a name (<code class="literal">phat_test</code>). Once you are finished, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Create Project</strong></span>.</li></ol><div style="height:10px; width: 1px"/></div><p>After everything comes up on your screen, in <span class="strong"><strong>Content Browser</strong></span>, locate the <span class="strong"><strong>ThirdPersonBP</strong></span> folder and click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Character</strong></span> folder. Find <span class="strong"><strong>ThirdPersonSkelMesh</strong></span> and then right-click on the list and select <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Physics Asset</strong></span>, as shown in the following screenshot. Then, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Ok</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>New Asset</strong></span> window.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"/>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>ThirdPersonSkelMesh</strong></span> can be found by the name <span class="strong"><strong>SK_Mannequin</strong></span> in the newer version of Unreal Engine 4.</p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00201.jpeg" alt="Navigating to PhAT"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00202.jpeg" alt="Navigating to PhAT"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>Now, if everything works fine, you will find your selected mesh in <span class="strong"><strong>Physics Asset Tool</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>PhAT</strong></span>. This kind of <a id="id88" class="indexterm"/>editor allows you to put some custom controllers on parts of your character's mesh based on your bones. These controllers are sensitive to physical aspects, such as world gravity, movements of other parts, rotations on each part, and collisions between parts.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00203.jpeg" alt="Navigating to PhAT"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>We will select a human like mesh. Imagine that this is an enemy and a player should shoot this object. After <a id="id89" class="indexterm"/>shooting, on hit, the enemy character falls on the surface. For simulating this scenario, set your camera as shown in the following screenshot, and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Simulate</strong></span> from the top menu:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00204.jpeg" alt="Navigating to PhAT"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>Then, set your camera to this view and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Simulate</strong></span>.</p><p>In the preceding <a id="id90" class="indexterm"/>screenshot, you can see that the character falls, but the way it falls is not natural in many ways. The following image is a screenshot of this action. Here, you can see that the hands and backbones are in an unreal position. PhAT can solve all these problems by customizing each bone movement based on physical rules (such as gravity).</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00205.jpeg" alt="Navigating to PhAT"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>The problem <a id="id91" class="indexterm"/>persists on the back and hands as the mesh falls.</p><p>Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Simulate</strong></span> again to go back to the normal mode.</p><div class="section" title="The PhAT environment"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec13"/>The PhAT environment</h2></div></div></div><p>PhAT has a couple of <a id="id92" class="indexterm"/>gadgets and sections.

This is used for animation purposes. Some bones have a bold font, whereas some don't. When you assign a physical asset to a bone, Unreal Engine automatically makes it bold. This is useful for addressing the bones involved with a glance over them. You can turn it on/off using the <span class="strong"><strong>Windows</strong></span> button from the top menu.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>: This saves the current asset on the model.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Find in CB</strong></span>: This locates the current asset in <span class="strong"><strong>Content Browser</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Simulate</strong></span>: This runs the simulation.</li><li class="listitem">Little arrow in front of <span class="strong"><strong>Simulate</strong></span>: This changes the simulation mode between the <span class="strong"><strong>Real</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>No Gravity</strong></span> types of simulation.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Selected Simulation</strong></span>: When you select one bone and then hit simulate, the only selected bone and its branch (or children) will react to simulation.

There is a quick method to perform this, that is, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> from the top menu bar and then on <span class="strong"><strong>Select All Objects</strong></span>. Now, click on <span class="emphasis"><em>Delete</em></span> on your keyboard. Try this and then click on <span class="strong"><strong>Undo</strong></span> from the same menu. You can also try another useful method, which is explained in the next section.</p><div class="section" title="Deleting current assets"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec01"/>Deleting current assets</h3></div></div></div><p>Perform the <a id="id103" class="indexterm"/>following steps to delete current assets:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Set your camera as shown in the following screensahot:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00211.jpeg" alt="Deleting current assets"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></li><li class="listitem">Now, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Simulate</strong></span> and wait until the body fully lies down on the ground, as <a id="id104" class="indexterm"/>shown in the following screenshot. It is possible that your result would be a bit different, but no problem. You can try and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Simulate</strong></span> to reach the closest form of the image:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00212.jpeg" alt="Deleting current assets"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></li><li class="listitem">Now, press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> and right-click to hold the head and move your mouse up not fast, but <a id="id105" class="indexterm"/>not slow either. It looks like the mesh is hanging to your mouse pointer, as shown in the following screenshot:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00213.jpeg" alt="Deleting current assets"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>Without releasing the right mouse button, move your mouse in the left and <a id="id106" class="indexterm"/>right direction over the stage and watch the elements of the mesh connecting and moving with each other.

Grab all the other parts of the character and experience the same movement with different mouse speed. This is kind of fun with PhAT and also shows how the body is connected with bones. You can track this in <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Simulate</strong></span> to go back to the normal mode and right click on <span class="strong"><strong>spine_03</strong></span> in <a id="id107" class="indexterm"/><span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span>. As you can see in the following screenshot, this part is selected in a different color. Now, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Simulate</strong></span>. Then, grab this part (<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span>, right-click and hold) and move it. Select <span class="strong"><strong>Simulate</strong></span> again to return to normal. This time, select <span class="strong"><strong>foot_r</strong></span> and try to simulate and grab it and move the character. As you can see, when you grab the body and move, other parts create a kind of rhythm, which depends on your mouse movement on the screen. This is caused by the default physic assets of each part.<div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00215.jpeg" alt="Deleting current assets"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></li><li class="listitem">Now, right-click on <span class="strong"><strong>clavicle_r</strong></span> and select <span class="strong"><strong>Delete All Bodies Below</strong></span>, as shown in the following screenshot. It looks like nothing seriously happened here, but when you <a id="id108" class="indexterm"/>click on simulate, boom! The left arm remains still, and a totally different behavior is displayed. Stop the simulation, right-click on <span class="strong"><strong>clavicle_l</strong></span>, select <span class="strong"><strong>Delete All Bodies Below</strong></span>, and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Simulate</strong></span> again. Now, both hands appear still, and it doesn't behave like before. Select <span class="strong"><strong>Undo</strong></span> to track the difference between the previous and current behavior.<div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00216.jpeg" alt="Deleting current assets"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>This practice is essential to understand what PhAT can provide us in the game. When you select <span class="strong"><strong>Delete All Bodies Below</strong></span>, you can delete all the previous physic assets on the bones that will connect to your selected bone. You can track this in <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span>. For example, <span class="strong"><strong>clavicle_r</strong></span> is connected to <span class="strong"><strong>upperarm_r</strong></span>, same logic (image it as chain of bones), <span class="strong"><strong>upperarm_r</strong></span> is connected to <span class="strong"><strong>lowerarm_r</strong></span>. And, <span class="strong"><strong>lowerarm_r</strong></span> is connected to hand_r. Here, hand_r is last member of these series of the bones. (this is important for the last bone). If you apply any physical rule to <span class="strong"><strong>clavicle_r</strong></span>, the energy flows through the other bones until the end: <span class="strong"><strong>hand_r</strong></span>. When you select <span class="strong"><strong>Delete All Bodies Below</strong></span>, you can actually delete this path to navigate energy. This is why the hands look solid in simulation.</p><p>This is a basic understanding of what PhAT is used for. You will learn how to design certain assets that guide and reflect the physical input from the environment (such as gravity or collision) through the bones of the character.</p><p>To see how these assets will function and navigate energy, select <span class="strong"><strong>top bone to down bone (or bones)</strong></span> in <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> and check whether <span class="strong"><strong>clavicle_r</strong></span> is <a id="id109" class="indexterm"/>connected to <span class="strong"><strong>spine_03</strong></span>. The bigger bone sends/navigates the physic assets/energy to <span class="strong"><strong>clavicle_r</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00217.jpeg" alt="Deleting current assets"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></li><li class="listitem">Try the same with <span class="strong"><strong>thigh_l</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>thigh_r</strong></span>.

Refer to the last part, try to delete the different bones asset, and simulate the scene. Then, select <span class="strong"><strong>Undo</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Redo</strong></span>. This is a creative practice for game designers.</p><p>Now, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> from the top menu bar, select <span class="strong"><strong>All Objects</strong></span>, and press <span class="emphasis"><em>Delete</em></span> on your keyboard.

You can test the overall movement and, when everything looks fine, increase the assets on smaller bones (such as fingers).</li></ol><div style="height:10px; width: 1px"/></div></li><li class="listitem">As you go further, you should be aware of a correction that needs to be performed at the end of each series of bones. Similar to fingers, head, and toes, this is simply related to physical energy. When the body moves, based on the physic assets and the way you edit these, the body reflects and guides the movements from one bone to another. If there is no bone after the current one, such as <span class="strong"><strong>head</strong></span> or the last part of the finger, it sometimes ends in an unusual vibrate-like movements over the bone during the simulation and the real game. To guide this energy in a controlled way, click on the bone in <span class="strong"><strong>Body Mode</strong></span>, expand the <span class="strong"><strong>Physics</strong></span> section in <span class="strong"><strong>Details</strong></span>, set <span class="strong"><strong>Angular Damping</strong></span> to <code class="literal">5</code> and <span class="strong"><strong>Linear damping</strong></span> to <code class="literal">1</code>, and simulate. Now, check your movements and change these numbers until the problem is fixed.<div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00234.jpeg" alt="Adding and customizing current assets"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></li></ol><div style="height:10px; width: 1px"/></div></div></div></div></div>

Keep in mind that working on PhAT is presenting the game story over the character behavior. It is an art because all the details and time that you spend here are directly monitored and tried by the player (perhaps hundreds of times while playing the game). It is good practice to imagine a character with some special behaviors, like movement, impact on other objects like walls, guns or fire, in real world; and then, try to recreate that behavior using Unreal Engine. It is a physical simulation with many details which we have gone through in this chapter. As a game designer, more practice will guarantee high quality results.</p><p>You can import the rigged mesh from the 3D software and apply the same physic assets to them. The mesh should be rigged in a proper way, which is similar to what we used as default in this chapter. Try the online sources by searching Unreal Engine 4 PhAT on YouTube. Also, if you practise the example, you can use the resources of Unreal Engine 3 and tuts in this area.</p></div></body></html>
