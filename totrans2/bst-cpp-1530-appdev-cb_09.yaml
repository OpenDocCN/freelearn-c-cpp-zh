    of some of their members. The knowledge about complexities is essential for writing

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The comparison of strings is slow because we are required to compare all the
    characters of the string one-by-one, if the strings are of equal length. Instead
    of doing that, we replace the comparison of strings with the comparison of integers.
    This is done via the hash function—the function that makes some short-fixed length
    representation of the string. Let us talk about the hash values on apples. Imagine
    that you have two apples with labels, as shown in the following diagram, and you
    wish to check that the apples are of the same cultivar. The simplest way to compare
    those apples is to compare them by labels. Otherwise you'll lose a lot of time
    comparing the apples based on the color, size, form, and other parameters. A hash
    is something like a label that reflects the value of the object.

- en: Here, `boost::hash<std::string>` is a structure, a functional object just like
    `std::negate<>`. That is why we need the first parenthesis—we construct that functional
    object. The second parenthesis with `s` inside is a call to `std::size_t operator()(const
    std::string& s)`, which will compute the hash value.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE6]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: And, take additional care about the second part of the expression. The hashing
    operation loses information, which means that there is a possibility that more
    than one string produces exactly the same hash value. It means that if the hashes
    mismatch, there is a 100 percent guarantee that the strings will not match, otherwise
    we are required to compare the strings using the traditional methods.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well, it's time to compare numbers. If we measure the execution time using the
    default comparison method, it will give us 819 milliseconds; however, our hashing
    comparison works almost two times faster and finishes in 475 milliseconds.

- en: Unordered containers store values and remember the hash of each value. Now if
    you wish to find a value in them, they will compute the hash of that value and
    search for that hash in the container. After the hash is found, the containers
    check for equality between the found value and the searched value. Then, the iterator
    to the value, or to the end of the container is returned.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because the container can search for a constant width integral hash value, it
    may use some optimizations and algorithms suitable only for integers. Those algorithms
    guarantee constant search complexity O(1), when traditional `std::set` and `std::map`
    provide worse complexity O(log(N)), where N is the number of elements in the container.
    This leads us to a situation where the more elements in traditional `std::set`
    or `std::map` , the slower it works. However, the performance of unordered containers
    does not depend on the element count.

    only forward. Step 3 will be trivial for those readers who are aware of STL containers,
    so we move to step 4 to see some `boost::container::slist` specific features.
    Since the single-linked list iterator could iterate only forward, traditional
    algorithms of insertion and deletion will take linear time O(N). That's because
    when we are erasing or inserting, the previous element must be modified to point
    at new elements of the list. To workaround that issue, the single-linked list
    has the methods `erase_after` and `insert_after` that work for constant time O(1).
    These methods insert or erase elements right after the current position of the
    iterator.

    important steps while working with flat associative containers and `std::vector`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `boost::container::flat_set` class stores its values ordered in vector,
    which means that any insertion or deletion of elements takes linear time O(N),
    just like in case of `std::vector`. This is a necessary evil. But for that, we
    gain almost three times less memory usage per element, more processor cache friendly
    storage, and random access iterators. Take a look at step 5, `5.1`, where we were
    getting the distance between two iterators returned by calls to the `lower_bound`
    member functions. Getting distance with a flat set takes constant time O(1), while
    the same operation on iterators of `std::set` takes linear time O(N). In the case
    of `5.1`, getting the distance using `std::set` would be 400 times slower than
    getting the distance for flat set containers.

- en: Back to step 3\. Without reserving memory, insertion of elements can become
    at times slower and less memory efficient. The `std::vector` class allocates the
    required chunk of memory and the in-place construct elements on that chunk. When
    we insert some element without reserving the memory, there is a chance that there
    is no free space remaining on the preallocated chunk of memory, so `std::vector`
    will allocate twice the chunk of memory that was allocated previously. After that,
    `std::vector` will copy or move elements from the first chunk to the second, delete
    elements of the first chunk, and deallocate the first chunk. Only after that,
    insertion will occur. Such copying and deallocation may occur multiple times during
    insertions, dramatically reducing the speed.
