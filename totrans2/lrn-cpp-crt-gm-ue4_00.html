You have a great number of reasons to do so:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">UE4 is powerful: UE4 provides some of the most state-of-the-art, beautiful, realistic lighting and physics effects, of the kind used by AAA Studios.</li><li class="listitem">UE4 is device-agnostic: Code written for UE4 will work on Windows desktop machines, Mac desktop machines, Android devices, and iOS devices (at the time of writing this book—even more devices may be supported in the future).</li></ul></div><p class="calibre9">So, you can use UE4 to write the main parts of your game once, and after that, deploy to iOS and Android Marketplaces without a hitch. (Of course, there will be a few hitches: iOS and Android in app purchases will have to be programmed separately.)</p></div>

<div class="book" title="Preface" id="7K4G1-dd4a3f777fc247568443d5ffb917736d">
<div class="book" title="What is a game engine anyway?"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02" class="calibre1"/>What is a game engine anyway?</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">A game engine is analogous to a car engine: the game engine is what drives the game. You will tell the engine what you want, and (using C++ code and the UE4 editor) the engine will be responsible for actually making that happen.</p><p class="calibre9">You will build your game around the UE4 game engine, similar to how the body and wheels are built around an actual car engine. When you ship a game with UE4, you are basically customizing the UE4 engine and retrofitting it with your own game's graphics, sounds, and code.</p></div></div>
<div class="book" title="What will using UE4 cost me?" id="8IL21-dd4a3f777fc247568443d5ffb917736d"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03" class="calibre1"/>What will using UE4 cost me?</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">The answer, in short, is $19 and 5 percent of sales.</p><p class="calibre9">"What?" you say. $19?</p><p class="calibre9">That's right. For only $19, you get full access to a world class AAA Engine, complete with a source. This is a great bargain, considering the fact that other engines can cost anywhere from $500 to $1,000 for just a single license.</p></div>
<div class="book" title="Why don't I just program my own engine and save the 5 percent?" id="9H5K1-dd4a3f777fc247568443d5ffb917736d"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04" class="calibre1"/>Why don't I just program my own engine and save the 5 percent?</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">Take it from me, if you want to create games within a reasonable time frame and you don't have a large team of dedicated engine programmers to help you, you'll want to focus your efforts on what you sell (your game).</p><p class="calibre9">Not having to focus on programming a game engine gives you the freedom to think only about how to make the actual game. Not having to maintain and bug-fix your own engine is a load off your mind too.</p></div>

<div class="book" title="A game's overview &#x2013; the Play-Reward-Growth loop" id="AFM61-dd4a3f777fc247568443d5ffb917736d"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05" class="calibre1"/>A game's overview – the Play-Reward-Growth loop</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">I want to show you this diagram now because it contains a core concept that many novice developers might miss when writing their first games. A game can be complete with sound effects, graphics, realistic physics, and yet, still not feel like a game. Why is that?</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00002.jpeg" alt="A game's overview – the Play-Reward-Growth loop" class="calibre11"/></div><p class="calibre12"> </p><p class="calibre9">Starting at the top of the loop, Play actions committed during the game (such as defeating a monster) result in rewards for the player (such as gold or experience). These rewards, in turn, can be used for in-game Growth (such as stats increases or new worlds to explore). This Growth then drives the gameplay in new and interesting ways. For example, a new weapon can change the basic mechanics of fighting, new spells let you take on groups of monsters with a completely different approach, or new modes of transportation can let you reach areas that were previously inaccessible.</p><p class="calibre9">This is the basic core loop that creates interesting gameplay. The key is that Play must result in some kind of Reward—think of glittering gold pieces popping out of nasty baddies. For rewards to have a point, it must result in some kind of Growth in the gameplay. Think about how many new locations were unlocked with the hook shot in <span class="strong"><em class="calibre10">The Legend of Zelda</em></span>.</p><p class="calibre9">A game that is only Play (without Rewards or Growth) won't feel like a game: it will feel only like a really basic prototype of a game. For example, imagine a flight simulator with just an open world and no goals or objectives as well as without the ability to upgrade your plane or weapons. It wouldn't be much of a game.</p><p class="calibre9">A game with only Play and Rewards (but no Growth) will feel primitive and simple. The rewards will not satisfy the player if they cannot be used for anything.</p><p class="calibre9">A game with only Play and Growth (without Rewards) will just be seen as a mindless increasing challenge, without giving the player a sense of gratification for his achievements.</p><p class="calibre9">A game with all three elements will keep the player engaged with an entertaining Play. The Play has a rewarding result (loot drops and story progression), which results in the Growth of the game world. Keeping this loop in mind while you are devising your game will really help you to design a complete game.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip01" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre9">A prototype is the proof of concept of a game. Say, you want to create your own unique version of <span class="strong"><em class="calibre10">Blackjack</em></span>. The first thing you might do is program a prototype to show how the game will be played.</p></div></div>

<div class="book" title="A game's overview &#x2013; the Play-Reward-Growth loop" id="AFM61-dd4a3f777fc247568443d5ffb917736d">

How will your game make money? If you are trying to start a company, you have to think of what will be your sources of revenue from early on.</p><p class="calibre9">Are you going to try to make money from the purchase price, such as <span class="strong"><em class="calibre10">Jamestown</em></span>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre10">The Banner Saga</em></span>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre10">Castle Crashers</em></span>, or <span class="strong"><em class="calibre10">Crypt of the Necrodancer</em></span>? Or, will you focus on distributing a free game with in-app purchases, such as <span class="strong"><em class="calibre10">Clash of Clans</em></span>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre10">Candy Crush Saga</em></span>, or <span class="strong"><em class="calibre10">Subway Surfers</em></span>?</p><p class="calibre9">A class of games for mobile devices (for example, builder games on iOS) make lots of money by allowing the user to pay in order to skip Play and jump straight to the rewards and Growth parts of the loop. The pull to do this can be very powerful; many people spend hundreds of dollars on a single game.</p></div></div>
