    of the physical rules in the world we live, the dice drops differently on wood,
    stone, glass, and carpet. The same can be said for glass, plastic ball, and enemy
    body (more complex). Using PhAT, you will learn how to simulate reality based
    on the physical rules that exist in the game world. This is kind of animated,
    but with more logics and tools.

    same logic (image it as chain of bones), **upperarm_r** is connected to **lowerarm_r**.
    And, **lowerarm_r** is connected to hand_r. Here, hand_r is last member of these
    series of the bones. (this is important for the last bone). If you apply any physical
    rule to **clavicle_r**, the energy flows through the other bones until the end:

    to the real world. Keep in mind that working on PhAT is presenting the game story
    over the character behavior. It is an art because all the details and time that
    you spend here are directly monitored and tried by the player (perhaps hundreds
    of times while playing the game). It is good practice to imagine a character with
    some special behaviors, like movement, impact on other objects like walls, guns
    or fire, in real world; and then, try to recreate that behavior using Unreal Engine.
    It is a physical simulation with many details which we have gone through in this
    chapter. As a game designer, more practice will guarantee high quality results.
