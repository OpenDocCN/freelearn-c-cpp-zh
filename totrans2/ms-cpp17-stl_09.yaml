    systems, "text" and "bytes" are the same thing. However, if you're on one of those
    strange operating systems where newlines are encoded as two bytes, or where the
    expected encoding for text files is not UTF-8, then there must be some additional
    processing going on in one or both of these stages, or even further downstream
    (such as in the operating system syscall that writes the data to the file). We
    won't talk much more about that kind of thing, because my hope is that you're
    not using that kind of operating system (or locale) for actual production use.
    In production, you should *always* be using UTF-8 for character encoding, and
    UTC for your time zone, and `"C.UTF-8"` for your locale. So, for our purposes,
    we can pretend that "formatting" and "buffering" are the only pieces of the pipeline

    even if you had just been reading from a different position). Opening a file descriptor
    in append mode is useful if you''re using it for logging, especially if you''re
    using it for logging from different threads. Some standard utility programs, such
    as `logrotate`, work best when the program doing the logging has correctly opened

    in a text editor, this cursor points to the place in the underlying file where
    the next read or write will take place. Using `read` or `write` on a descriptor
    advances its cursor. And, as described in the previous paragraph, using `write`
    on a file descriptor in "append mode" will reset the cursor to the very end of
    the file. Notice that there is only a single cursor per file descriptor! If you

    in a buffer at the OS level, or at the disk-controller level, or in the hardware,
    but as far as your program is concerned, the data is *on its way*. Any further
    delay in the output is out of your control and not your fault. This, in turn,
    means that if you need to write a lot of data efficiently using the POSIX API,
    your program must take charge of writing data to a buffer and then sending that

    However, in your own code, `k` should always be the literal `1`; using anything

    always divided by `k`, and if `k` is anything but `1`, you will lose information.
    For example, if `k` is 8, a return value of 3 indicates that "somewhere between
    24 and 31" bytes were read and stored into the buffer, but `buffer[3]` may now
    contain a partially written value--that is to say, garbage--and you have no way

    passing any `k` other than 1 runs the risk of overflow and an incorrectly computed
    buffer length. No popular implementation checks that multiplication for overflow;

    The first is the idea of *standard streams*. There are three standard streams
    in C and C++: `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. In our word-counting program, we
    follow the rule that if the command-line user has not explicitly told us any filename
    to read from, we''ll read from `stdin`, the *standard input stream*, which is
    usually a synonym for the console (or terminal or keyboard--point is, it''s the
    human being sitting there typing). Various mechanisms within the operating system
    and the command-line shell can be used to *redirect* the standard input stream
    from other inputs; these mechanisms (such as typing `wc <myfile.txt` at the shell
    prompt) are far outside the scope of this book. The main things to remember about
    the three standard streams are that they are automatically available to you by
    name without having to `fopen` them; and that it is always an error to `fclose`
    any of them.'

    The `getc(fp)` function reads a single byte from the given `FILE *` and returns
    the byte it read. If there was an error, or (more likely) if it hit end-of-file,
    it returns a special value named `EOF`. The numerical value of `EOF` is usually
    `-1;`, but the guaranteed thing about it is that it is completely different from
    any possible *valid* byte. For this reason, `getc(fp)` does not return its return
    value as `char`; it returns it as `int`, which is big enough to store any possible
    `char` and, in addition, big enough to store the value `EOF` distinct from any
    of those `char` values (if `char` is a signed type on your platform--as it is
    on many platforms--then `getc` will convert `char` it read into `unsigned char`
    before returning it; this ensures that if the `0xFF` byte appears in the input
    file, it will be returned as `255`, which is a different integer value than `-1`
    that represents `EOF`).

    A full treatment of locales is out of the scope of this book; however, in short,
    the *locale* is "the subset of a user's environment that depends on language and
    cultural conventions." Locale information is exposed programmatically via the
    operating system, allowing a single program to adjust its behavior depending on
    the current user's preferred locale, for example, to control whether "á" is considered
    an alphabetic character, whether the week begins with Sunday or Monday, whether
    dates print as "23-01-2017" or "01-23-2017", and whether floating-point numbers
    print as "1234.56" or "1.234,56". Now, a programmer from the 21st century may
    look at all of those examples and say, "This is crazy! You mean, not one of these
    things is specified by a *standard*? It seems like this situation would inevitably
    lead to subtle and painful bugs!" And you'd be correct!

    you would in a C program, you'll make `<stdio.h>` work correctly but not affect

    In fact, the availability of *any* locale other than `"C"` depends on the user.
    Locales are similar to time zones in this way: there is only one locale and one

    go ahead and use `snprintf` and `operator<<` to your heart's content. (However,
    notice that this does not solve the performance problem associated with locale-aware
    programming. That global mutex lock will still be there, taking up valuable cycles.)
    The harder path--harder because it requires conscientious adherence to a subtle
    guideline--is to avoid all use of locale-aware formatting functions. This path

- en: While the I/O facilities of C++ are certainly very complicated, as befits a
    system's programming language with its roots in the 1980s, we see from these last
    few examples that it is nonetheless possible to hide this complexity under a layer
    of abstraction and end up with code that looks almost as simple as Python.

- en: Data output can be divided roughly into *formatting* and *buffering*. Data input
    can be divided just as roughly into *buffering* and *parsing*; although, the parsing
    step gets easier if you can put a *lexing* step in front. (We'll talk more about
    lexing in the very next chapter!)

- en: The classical iostreams API is built on top of `<stdio.h>`, which in turn is
    built on top of the POSIX file-descriptor API. You can't understand the higher
    levels without a good understanding of the levels beneath it. In particular, the
    mess of `fopen` mode strings and `fstream` constructor flags can be understood
    only by reference to lookup tables mapping them onto the actual underlying POSIX
    `open` flags.

- en: The POSIX API is concerned only with moving chunks of data to and from file
    descriptors; it does not "buffer" data in the naive sense. The `<stdio.h>` API
    adds a layer of buffering on top of POSIX; the C `FILE` may be fully buffered,
    line-buffered, or unbuffered. Furthermore, `<stdio.h>` provides performant (but
    locale-aware) formatting routines, of which the most important are `fprintf`,
    `snprintf`, and `sscanf`.

- en: The `<iostream>` API separates the "streambuf", (which identifies the source
    or sink of raw bytes, and its buffering mode) from the "stream" (which holds the
    state related to formatting). The different kinds of streams (input or output?
    file or string?) form a classical polymorphic hierarchy with complicated and,
    at times, unintuitive inheritance relationships. Avoiding `<iostream>` in production
    code is preferable as it is slow and opaque compared to the `<stdio.h>` or POSIX
    interfaces. Either way, beware of locale-dependent formatting routines.

- en: For one-off quick tasks, prefer parsing numbers via `std::stoi`, which detects
    and throws on error, and formatting with `std::to_string` or `snprintf`. For high-performance
    situations, parsing with `std::from_chars` and formatting with `std::to_chars`
    is preferable if you can find a library implementation that supports these brand
    new functions from the `<charconv>` header.
