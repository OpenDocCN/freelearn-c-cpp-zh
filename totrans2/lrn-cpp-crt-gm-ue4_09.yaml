    "Chapter 7. Dynamic Memory Allocation"), *Dynamic Memory Allocation*, we spoke
    about how you will use dynamic memory allocation if you want to create a new array
    whose size isn't known at compile time. Dynamic memory allocations are of the
    form `int * array = new int[ number_of_elements ]`.

- en: You also saw that dynamic allocations using the `new[]` keyword require you
    to call `delete[]` on the array later, otherwise you'd have a memory leak. Having
    to manage memory this way is hard work.
  id: totrans-2
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Is there a way to create an array of dynamic size and have the memory automatically
    managed for you by C++? The answer is yes. There are C++ object types (commonly
    called containers) that handle dynamic memory allocations and deallocations automatically.
    UE4 provides a couple of container types to store your data in dynamically resizable
    collections.

- en: There are two different groups of template containers. There is the UE4 family
    of containers (beginning with `T*`) and the C++ **Standard Template Library**
    (**STL**) family of containers. There are some differences between the UE4 containers
    and the C++ STL containers, but the differences are not major. UE4 containers
    sets are written with game performance in mind. C++ STL containers also perform
    well, and their interfaces are a little more consistent (consistency in an API
    is something that you'd prefer). Which container set you use is up to you. However,
    it is recommended that you use the UE4 container set since it guarantees that
    you won't have cross-platform issues when you try to compile your code.

    variable is, you first have to know what the `<T>` option between angle brackets
    stands for. The `<T>` option means that the type of data stored in the array is
    a variable. Do you want an array of `int`? Then create a `TArray<int>` variable.
    A `TArray` variable of `double`? Create a `TArray<double>` variable.

    all the items we're going to take in. Ask the user for an item and a quantity;
    then we save the `item` in the `items` map using square brackets notation.
