- en: 'The word size of some the basic data types (`char`, `int`, `long`, and so on)
    varies across platforms, compilers, and CPU architectures. A good example is the
    type `long`. In Xcode on Mac OS X, `long` is 32 bits wide when compiling 32-bit
    code and 64 bits wide when compiling 64-bit code. In Microsoft Visual Studio on
    Windows, `long` is always 32 bits wide. (The same applies to the unsigned versions
    too.) JUCE defines a handful of primitive types to assist the writing of platform-independent
    code. Many of these have familiar names and may be the same names used in other
    libraries and frameworks in use by your code. These types are defined in the `juce`
    namespace; therefore, can be disambiguated using the `juce::` prefix if necessary.
    These primitive types are: `int8` (8-bit signed integer), `uint8` (8-bit unsigned
    integer), `int16` (16-bit signed integer), `uint16` (16-bit unsigned integer),
    `int32` (32-bit signed integer), `uint32` (32-bit unsigned integer), `int64` (64-bit
    signed integer), `uint64` (64-bit unsigned integer), `pointer_sized_int` (a signed
    integer that is the same word size as a pointer on the platform), `pointer_sized_uint`
    (an unsigned integer that is the same word size as a pointer on the platform),
    and `juce_wchar` (a 32-bit Unicode character type).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In many cases the built-in types are sufficient. For example, JUCE internally
    makes use of the `int` data type for a number of purposes, but the preceding types
    are available where the word size is critical. In addition to this, JUCE does
    not define special data types for `char`, `float`, or `double`. Both floating-point
    types are assumed to be compliant with IEEE 754, and the `float` data type is
    assumed to be 32 bits wide and the `double` data type 64 bits wide.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In JUCE, text is generally manipulated using the `String` class. In many ways,
    this class may be seen as an alternative to the C++ Standard Library `std::string`
    class. We have already used the `String` class for the basic operations in earlier
    chapters. For example, in [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Building User Interfaces"),
    *Building User Interfaces*, strings were used to set the text appearing on a `TextButton`
    object and used to store a dynamically changing string to display in response
    to mouse activity. Even though these examples were quite simple, they harnessed
    the power of the `String` class to make setting and manipulating the strings straightforward
    for the user.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first way this is achieved is through storing strings using **reference
    counted** objects. That is to say, when a string is created, behind the scenes
    JUCE allocates some memory for the string, stores the string, and returns a `String`
    object that refers to this allocated memory in the background. Straight copies
    of this string (that is, without any modifications) are simply new `String` objects
    that refer to this same shared memory. This helps keep code efficient by allowing
    `String` objects to be passed by value between functions, without the potential
    overhead of copying large chunks of memory in the process.

    User Interface (GUI), application in the first instance. Create a new Introjucer

    and it is these pointers that are stored in the array. (Notice also, that there
    is no need for the `&` operator in the function call to `Component::addAndMakeVisible()`
    because the value is already a pointer.) In the `resized()` function, we use a
    `Rectangle<int>` object to create a rectangle that is inset from the `MainContentComponent`

    for the remainder of this book. Each of these classes contains far more functionality
    than outlined here. Again, it is essential that you review the JUCE class documentation
    for each of the classes introduced in this chapter. Many of these classes are
    used heavily in the JUCE Demo application and the code for the Introjucer application.
    These should also serve as useful for further reading. The next chapter introduces
    classes for handling files, especially media files, such as image and sound files.
