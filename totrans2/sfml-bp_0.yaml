    and share them with you. Five different projects will be covered, which include
    many techniques and ways to resolve quite commons problems involved in game development.

- en: The technologies used are the C++ programming language (2011 standard) and the
    SFML library (version 2.2).

- en: Many aspects of game programming are developed over the different chapters and
    give you all the keys in hand to build every kind of game you want in 2D, with
    the only limit of your imagination.

    – Part 2, Networking*, introduces network architectures and networking. It helps
    you create a custom communication protocol, and modify our game to allow multiplayer
    matches over the network. Then, we finally add a save/load option to our game
    using Sqlite3 through an ORM.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To be able to build the projects covered throughout this book, you are assumed
    to have knowledge of the C++ language with its basic features, and also parts
    of the standard template library, such as strings, streams, and containers. It's
    important to keep in mind that game development is not an easy task, so if you
    don't have the prerequisites, it can get frustrating. So, don't hesitate to read
    some books or tutorials on C++ before starting with this one.
