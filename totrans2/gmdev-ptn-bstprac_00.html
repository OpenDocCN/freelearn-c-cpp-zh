<p class="calibre2">As your programs get larger, it is critical that you understand how to write code in such a way that classes and modules can communicate with each other in an intelligent way. Knowing how to write code that is clean and extensible is critical for the success of medium to large scale projects, especially if there are multiple programmers involved. We don't want to spend time rewriting another programmer’s code because it is easier than figuring out how the original code works. Likewise, we don’t want other programmers to be confused by our code and rewrite solutions to problems that we already solved.<br class="title-page-name"/>
This book explores the ins and outs of the most common ways to design code so that it can be understood, reused, maintained, and extended if necessary. These common design patterns will make communication between classes simple and clean. Whether you are using a commercial game engine or writing your own from scratch, knowledge of these patterns will make your game project more likely to succeed.<br class="title-page-name"/>
Each chapter of this book explores one of the most used design patterns for games. Together we discuss the problems that we are trying to solve and how a specific pattern can be of use to us. Within each chapter, we also cover the pros and cons of the pattern so you are better equipped to know when to use it. This book is not a "cook book". Using a pattern in your project isn’t as simple as copying some code that we provide. Instead of learning recipes for code, we are going to learn the fundamentals of how a game engine should be written.<br class="title-page-name"/>
We will do this by looking at lots of code examples. As we said, these example, can’t simply be copy and pasted into any project. However, by understanding how these examples fit into the specific project for this book, you can implement them in any project.</p>

<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0020.html#J2B80-04600e4b10ea45a2839ef4fc3675aeb7" class="calibre7">Chapter 1</a>, <em class="calibre12">Introduction to Design Patterns</em>, introduces the concept of design patterns and how they can benefit our projects. We also dive into learning about the advantages of compartmentalizing our code and set up a sample project that we can use to build upon in the book.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0047.html#1CQAE0-04600e4b10ea45a2839ef4fc3675aeb7" class="calibre7">Chapter 2</a>, <em class="calibre12">One Instance to Rule Them All – Singletons</em>, discusses the well-known singleton pattern, explaining common arguments for and against having a single instance that’s accessible globally within our game.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0064.html#1T1400-04600e4b10ea45a2839ef4fc3675aeb7" class="calibre7">Chapter 3</a>, <em class="calibre12">Creating Flexibility with the Component Object Model</em>, explores how to create a large amount of different game object types while minimizing code duplication.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0083.html#2F4UM0-04600e4b10ea45a2839ef4fc3675aeb7" class="calibre7">Chapter 4</a>, <em class="calibre12">Artificial Intelligence Using the State Pattern</em>, shows the usage of states to allow a game object to change its behavior and functionality due to different stimuli in your game. We discuss and apply how we can use this concept in both player behavior and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0096.html#2RHM00-04600e4b10ea45a2839ef4fc3675aeb7" class="calibre7">Chapter 5</a>, <em class="calibre12">Decoupling Code via the Factory Method Pattern</em>, explains how we separate our specific game objects from our game engine.  This will allow us to reuse all or at least part of our game engine for future games.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0112.html#3APV00-04600e4b10ea45a2839ef4fc3675aeb7" class="calibre7">Chapter 6</a>, <em class="calibre12">Creating Objects with the Prototype Pattern</em>, covers another way to reduce dependencies within our game engine.  We learn how to create objects through their base classes.  In addition, we cover how to read object data from a file.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0133.html#3UQQQ0-04600e4b10ea45a2839ef4fc3675aeb7" class="calibre7">Chapter 7</a>, <em class="calibre12">Improving Performance with Object Pools</em>, covers a way to improve memory costs in our games by reusing objects that we’ve created dynamically by making use of a manager to control what is and isn’t being used at the moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0143.html#48C0E0-04600e4b10ea45a2839ef4fc3675aeb7" class="calibre7">Chapter 8</a>, <em class="calibre12">Controlling the UI via the Command Pattern</em>, discusses how to create reusable actions that can be utilized for UI button clicks or input devices such as keyboard or controller.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0161.html#4PHAI0-04600e4b10ea45a2839ef4fc3675aeb7" class="calibre7">Chapter 9</a>, <em class="calibre12">Decoupling Gameplay via the Observer Pattern</em>, explains multiple ways that classes can communicate and share data without using global variables. </p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0179.html#5AMKM0-04600e4b10ea45a2839ef4fc3675aeb7" class="calibre7">Chapter 10</a>, <em class="calibre12">Sharing Objects with the Flyweight Pattern</em>, discusses how we can design our objects to be as lightweight as possible by separating data that can and can't be shared. We use this knowledge to create a particle system which produces smaller objects developed to simulate things like fire, explosions, and smoke.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0191.html#5M4RE0-04600e4b10ea45a2839ef4fc3675aeb7" class="calibre7">Chapter 11</a>, <em class="calibre12">Understanding Graphics and Animation</em>, provides a low-level explanation of how graphics and rendering work so that you are better able to implement it in your game.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0207.html#65D4E0-04600e4b10ea45a2839ef4fc3675aeb7" class="calibre7">Chapter 12</a>, <em class="calibre12">Best Practices</em>, covers a number of topics that will improve your code and game projects in the future, touching on things like how to improve your code quality, use the const keyword correctly, how iteration is a great way to improve game and code design, and when you should consider adding scripting to your game.</p>

<p class="calibre2">To write code, all you really need is a text editor, but for serious development you'll need to use an IDE (Integrated Developer Environment). We use Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and C++ in this book using a Windows computer but, the concepts taught can be used within any programming language as well. For those of you that do not have Visual Studio installed, but are using Windows we do go over how to install the free Visual Studio Community version and set it up with our project in <a href="part0020.html#J2B80-04600e4b10ea45a2839ef4fc3675aeb7" class="calibre7">Chapter 1</a><span>,</span> <em class="calibre12">Introduction to Design Pattern<span>s</span></em>.</p>

<p class="calibre2">This book is for anyone who wants to learn how to write better, cleaner code.  While design patterns in general do not require any specific programming language, the examples in this book are written in C++.  Readers will get much more out of this book if they are already familiar with C++ and STL containers.  The project that is included with this book was written and compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015, so familiarity with that IDE will be very helpful as well.</p>
