    progresses and the number of transistors in any given computational unit increases,
    there is more and more power at our disposal to do what was previously unheard
    of. One thing that definitely makes use of all of this extra horse power is dynamic
    lighting. Because of its stunning visual results, it has become an integral part
    of most video games, and is now one of the core technologies that are expected
    to come with them.

- en: Deferred rendering/shading is a technique that gives us greater control over
    how certain effects are applied to a scene by not enabling them during the first
    pass. Instead, the scene can be rendered to an off screen buffer, along with other
    buffers that hold other material types of the same image, and then drawn on the
    screen in a later pass, after the effects have been applied, potentially in multiple
    passes as well. Using this approach allows us to separate and compartmentalize
    certain logic that would otherwise be entangled with our main rendering code.
    It also gives us an opportunity to apply as many effects to the final image as
    we want. Let's see what it takes to implement this technique.

    between the pixel and the light's center. This vector is then converted into distance
    using the `length` function. This is the same type of distance that we calculated
    manually in the first iteration of this shader. The floating number variable `d`
    is then used to calculate the distance between the fragment and the outside of
    the light by subtracting the light's radius from it. The `max()` function simply
    makes sure we don't get a negative value back if the pixel is inside the light's
    bubble.

    can seem like an obvious choice to just push information about multiple light
    streams into the shader and have it all done in one pass. Unlike *C++*, however,
    GLSL needs to know the sizes of these arrays at compile time, which is very much
    like *C*. At the time of writing, dynamic size arrays aren't supported. While
    this information can put a damper on a naive plan of handling multiple light sources
    with ease, there are still options to choose from, obviously.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One approach to combat this may be to have a very large, statically sized array
    of data. Only some of that data would be filled in and the shader would process
    it by looping over the array while using a uniform integer that tells it how many
    lights were actually passed to it. This idea comes with a few obvious bottlenecks.
    First, there would be a threshold for the maximum number of light streams allowed
    on the screen. The second issue is performance. Sending data over to the GPU is
    costly and can quickly become inefficient if we send over too much information
    all at once.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'As flawed as the first idea is, it has one component that comes in handy when
    considering a better strategy: the maximum number of light streams allowed. Instead
    of pushing tons and tons of data through to the GPU at once, why not just do it
    a little bit at a time in different passes. If the right number of light streams
    is sent each time, both the CPU and GPU performance bottlenecks can be minimized.
    The results of each pass can then be blended together into a single texture.'

    the buffer textures of multiple passes. First, there's loss of information due
    to ambient lighting. If the light is too dark, every subsequent pass becomes less
    and less visible. To fix this problem, in addition to the color information of
    the last render pass, we're going to need access to the actual diffuse map.

    This can be benchmarked or simply gotten right through trial and error. For our

    the light shader can be modified to achieve this:'

    have been sent to the shader for the current pass and the pass we're dealing with
    at the moment.

    the usual data we expect. Underneath it, we need to declare a constant integer

    shader pass. The `finalPixel` variable is established early on and uses the information
    from the previous shader pass. It is important you note this, because the previous
    pass would be lost otherwise. Since we have access to the pass number in the shader
    now, we can selectively apply the ambient light to the pixel only during the first
    pass.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can then jump into a `for` loop that uses the `LightCount` uniform passed
    in from the C++ side. This design gives us control to only use as much data as
    was sent to the shader and not go overboard if the last shader pass has fewer
    light streams than the maximum number allowed.
  prefs: []

    of the fragment. All our calculations remain the same, except for using light
    data. The lights uniform is now accessed with the square brackets to fetch the
    correct information during each iteration of the loop. Note the final pixel calculation
    at the very bottom of the loop. It now uses the diffuse pixel instead of the pixel
    of a previous shader pass.

    as a vertex shader, outside of the uniform variable and the out variable, of course.
    The vertex shader outputs a floating point value called `Height` to the fragment
    shader. It's simply the height between the *Y* component of the vertex of a shape
    in world coordinates and the base *Y* position of that same shape. The height
    is then interpolated between all the fragments, giving a nice, gradient distribution.

    always start at the same height as the drawable, which makes the top *Y* coordinates
    equal to the sum of its position and height.

    base height of the drawable, and the interpolated `Height` value from the vertex
    shader. The diffuse pixel is then sampled in order to use its alpha value for
    transparency. The height value itself is calculated by subtracting the result
    of the pixel height being multipled by the surface normal's *Z* component from
    the base height of the drawable. The whole thing is finally divided by *255* because
    we want to store color information in a normalized format.

    world coordinates, all we need to do is replace the `gl_FragCoord.z` value with
    `pixelHeight` when calculating the distance between a pixel and a fragment. Yes,
    that's really all it takes!
