- en: Making games is a fine art. It is entirely possible, of course, to make art
    with the most basic of tools, but most commonly, developers need a strong toolkit
    supporting them in order to efficiently and professionally create quick, painless
    edits to their game. Building the said toolkit is arguably on a par with the difficulty
    of building the actual game, but the work spent on proper tools offsets the difficulty
    and frustrations that come with direct file edits.

    all elements it has that begin with the `""Entry_""` string. This is done in order
    to clear out all file and directory entries that may already exist. Finally, `ListFiles()`

    the full path of the current working directory. The complete file list inside
    that directory is then obtained, including other folders. After it gets sorted
    alphabetically and by type, the parent directory element is obtained to calculate
    the starting coordinates of the first element on the list, which is, in turn,
    iterated over. Non-physical directories, such as `"."` or `".."`, are dismissed.
    A new element is then added to the interface, with an appropriate name that varies
    depending on whether we are working with a file or a folder. That same element
    is then updated to have the entry name, be in the right position and have a correct
    style attached to it. Finally, the *y* coordinate is incremented for the next
    element on the list.

    as we want to be able to calculate our progress, and knowing how much work there
    is in total is needed for that. If after this method is called, the total number
    of lines is zero, we simply return as there is nothing to process.

    reset for new file iteration, and a line from the input stream is created. The
    number of lines remaining to be processed is created, and another loop is entered
    that will execute once for each line in the file. Our `sf::Mutex` object is then
    locked in order to safely manipulate the two line data members that are used for
    progress tracking.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    line and should just skip the current iteration. Otherwise, an `std::stringstream`
    of the current line is created and passed into the pure virtual `ProcessLine()`
    method, which is encapsulated in an `if` statement to catch a possible failure,
    in which case the remainder of lines inside the current file are simply added
    to the current line counter and the loop is broken out of.

    begin iterating over each path inside the file list. If the name of it is empty,
    the element is removed. Otherwise, we attempt to open the files. If that fails,
    the path is also erased. Otherwise, the file stream is requested to not skip whitespaces,
    and we enter a `sf::Mutex` lock, where the number of lines in the file stream
    is calculated using `std::count`, and added to the total line counter. The path
    iterator is then moved forward, and the file is closed.

    the size of the rectangle is set to match the full size of the window on the x
    axis, which shows full completion. The text in the middle is also updated to let
    the user know they need to press the spacebar key to continue. Finally, the update
    method is returned from once again, to prevent further logic from executing.
