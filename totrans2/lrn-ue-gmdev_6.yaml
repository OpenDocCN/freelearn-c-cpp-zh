    important but often go unnoticed unless they are badly designed and out of place.
    Yes, we will cover particle system and sound in this chapter. In most games, they
    blend in so naturally that they are easily forgotten. They can also be used to
    create the most memorable moments in a game.

- en: Just to recap, particle systems are used very often to create sparks, explosions,
    smoke, rain, snow, and other similar effects in a game that are dynamic, kind
    of fuzzy, and random in nature. Sound can be in the form of ambient sounds, such
    as the sound of rustling leaves and wind, one-off sounds, such as a pan dropping
    in the kitchen, or repetitive sounds, such as the running steps of a character
    or even music playing on the radio. Sound can be used to set the mood of a game,
    alert the player to something that needs attention, and provide realism to a level
    to make a place come alive. Let's get started.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A particle system is a way to model fuzzy objects, such as rain, fire, clouds,
    smoke, and water, which do not have smooth, well-defined surfaces and are nonrigid.
    The system is an optimized method to achieve such fluid-looking and dynamic visual
    representations by controlling the movement, behavior, interaction, and look of
    many tiny geometry objects or sprites.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using a combination of different particles made of different shapes, sizes,
    materials, and textures, with different movement speeds, rotation direction/speeds,
    spawn rates, concentration, visibility duration, and many more factors, we are
    able to create a huge variety of dynamic complex systems.

    system, and you can give each emitter different properties depending on what you
    want to create. When you put a bunch of emitters together, you will see them combining
    to give you a whole visual effect. In this **P_Fire** particle system, you can
    see flames moving in an unpredictable manner with some sparks and embers floating
    around and smoke simulating a fire bursting into flames. In the next section,

    modules, such as **Lifetime**, **Initial Velocity**, and so on, into them. Together,
    all the emitters make up a particle system. Lastly, when you place the emitters
    in your game level, you are, in fact, dragging the emitter actor, which references

    The key to doing this is knowing what parameters there are and what they affect.
    During the initial phase of design, you should also try adding or removing certain
    modules to see how they actually impact the overall look of the system. This does
    not mean that more is always better. Additionally, it is also wise to save backup
    copies of your iterations so that you can always go back to the previous versions
    easily.

    through a recording device. For multichannel sound recording, you need to have
    certain methods to record music that can use a simple recording setup known as
    **Deca Tree**. Here, microphones are placed in a particular fashion to capture
    sounds from the left, right, front, and back of the source. There are also many
    processing techniques that can filter and convert sounds that are recorded to
    mimic the various components needed for each of the channels.
  prefs: []

- en: We take samples of the analog sound waves that are produced by a piano at close
    intervals (the rate at which the samples are taken between intervals is known
    as sampling frequency). The process of taking samples from analog waves to store
    them digitally is known as **Pulse Code Modulation** (**PCM**). These samples
    can be stored in uncompressed PCM-like formats or be compressed into a smaller
    and more manageable file size using audio compression techniques. Wav, MP3, Ogg
    Vorbis, Dolby TrueHD, and DTS-HD are some of the formats that audio is commonly
    saved as. Ideally, we want to save audio into a lossless compressed format so
    that we get a small manageable file that contains amazing sounds.

    reconstructed using the stored information. Close resemblance to the original
    analog sound waves is one way to ensure sounds of good quality. By increasing
    the number of channels to create a 3D sound effect using the basic 5.1 surround,
    which requires five speakers, one for front left, one front right, one center,
    one back left (as surround), one back right (as surround) and a subwoofer, also
    greatly improves the listening experience.

- en: Both particles and sound are very interesting components of a game and require
    very specialized skills that are very apt for their design and creation. Particle
    system creators often have strong artistic and technical backgrounds; an artistic
    touch is needed to create suitable textures, and a technical ability helps to
    adjust distributions/values that create an appropriate overall effect. Audio engineers
    often have a strong music background. They are probably composers and musicians
    themselves with a passion for games.

- en: In the first half of the chapter, we learned about what a particle system is.
    We learned how particle systems are used to create in-game effects, such as falling
    snow, rainfall, flames, fireworks, explosion effects, and much more. A particle
    system can efficiently render small moving fuzzy particles using textures through
    a combination of emitters. Each emitter has many configurable modules that can
    control properties, such as a spawn rate, lifetime, velocity, and the acceleration
    needed to create the required effect. In this chapter, we covered how to edit
    an existing fire explosion particle system, turn it into a fireplace effect, and
    place it in a living room. Through this example, we also went through some basic
    principles that could be applied to the particle system design process, and how
    to make minor adjustments to a few popular basic modules to create the effect
    we wanted.

    is given to give you a better insight into sounds. Next, we went through a simple
    exercise to import an online audio file and get the music we have downloaded playing
    in the game level.
