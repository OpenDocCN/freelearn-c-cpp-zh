Additionally, you will learn how to create new C++ game code, work with Blueprints and Blueprint graphs, and work with custom data for your game. In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Downloading Unreal</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Setting up Visual Studio for use with Unreal</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Setting up a new Unreal project</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating new C++ classes</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating Blueprints and Blueprint graphs</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using Data Tables to import spreadsheet data</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Downloading Unreal"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec15"/>Downloading Unreal</h1></div></div></div><p>Before getting <a id="id59" class="indexterm"/>started, make sure that you have at least 18 GB of free disk space on your computer. You will need this disk space to hold the development environments for Unreal and also your project files.</p><p>We will now need to <a id="id60" class="indexterm"/>download Unreal. To do this, go to <a class="ulink" href="https://www.unrealengine.com">https://www.unrealengine.com</a> and click on the <span class="strong"><strong>GET UNREAL</strong></span> button.</p><p>Before you can download Unreal, you'll need to make an Epic Games account. The <span class="strong"><strong>GET UNREAL</strong></span> button will redirect you to an account creation form, so fill it out and submit it.</p><p>After you've signed in, you'll see the <span class="strong"><strong>Download</strong></span> button. This will download the installer for the Epic Games Launcher (from this launcher, you can download Unreal version 4.12).</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Downloading Visual Studio"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec16"/>Downloading Visual Studio</h1></div></div></div><p>We will <a id="id61" class="indexterm"/>need to start programming soon, so if you haven't already, now is the time to download Visual Studio, which is the integrated development environment that we will need to program the framework for our engine and game logic in C++. Luckily, Microsoft provides Visual Studio Community for free.</p><p>To download Visual Studio Community, go <a id="id62" class="indexterm"/>to <a class="ulink" href="https://www.visualstudio.com/">https://www.visualstudio.com/</a> and download Community 2015. This will download the installer for Visual Studio. After it downloads, simply run the installer. Note that Visual Studio Community 2015 does not install C++ by default, so be sure that under <span class="strong"><strong>Features</strong></span>, you are installing Visual C++, Common Tools for Visual C++ 2015, and Microsoft Foundation Classes for C++. If you do not have C++ installed, you will not be able to write or compile code written for UE4 in Visual Studio since UE4 is built on C++.</p></div>

While normally this is incredibly useful, in Unreal, it can frequently detect false positives and become more annoying than helpful.</p><p>To disable the error list, first close the <span class="strong"><strong>Error List</strong></span> tab (you can find this in the bottom pane, as shown in the following screenshot):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04548_02_10.jpg" alt="Disabling the Error List tab"/></div><p>Then, navigate<a id="id66" class="indexterm"/> to <span class="strong"><strong>Tools</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Options</strong></span>, expand the <span class="strong"><strong>Projects and Solutions</strong></span> group, and uncheck the <span class="strong"><strong>Always show Error List if build finishes with errors</strong></span> option:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04548_02_11.jpg" alt="Disabling the Error List tab"/></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Setting up a new Unreal project"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec18"/>Setting up a new Unreal project</h1></div></div></div><p>Now that <a id="id67" class="indexterm"/>you have both Unreal and Visual Studio downloaded and installed, we're going to create a project for our game.</p><p>Unreal comes with a variety of starter kits that you can use, but for our game, we'll be scripting everything from scratch.</p><p>After signing into Epic Games Launcher, you'll first want to download the Unreal Engine. This book uses version 4.12. You may use a later version, but depending on the version, some code and the navigation of the engine may slightly differ. The steps for creating a new project are as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Firstly, in the <span class="strong"><strong>Unreal Engine</strong></span> tab, select <span class="strong"><strong>Library</strong></span>. Then, under <span class="strong"><strong>Engine Versions</strong></span>, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Add Versions</strong></span> and select the version you'd like to download.</li><li class="listitem">After the engine has downloaded, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Launch</strong></span> button.</li><li class="listitem">Once the Unreal Engine has launched, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>New Project</strong></span> tab. Then, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>C++</strong></span> tab and select <span class="strong"><strong>Basic Code</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">Finally, choose a location for your project and give it a name (in my case, I named the project <code class="literal">RPG</code>).</li></ol></div><p>In my case, after the project was created, it automatically closed the engine and opened Visual Studio. At this point, I've found it best to close Visual Studio, go back to Epic Games Launcher, and relaunch the engine. Then, open your new project from here. Finally, after the editor has launched, go to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Open Visual Studio</strong></span>.</p><p>The reason for this is because, while you can launch the editor by compiling your Visual Studio project, in some rare cases you may have to close the editor any time you want to compile a new change. If, on the other hand, you launch Visual Studio from the editor (rather than the other way around), you can make a change in Visual Studio and then compile the code from within the editor.</p><p>At this point, you have an empty Unreal project and Visual Studio that are ready to go.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Creating a new C++ class"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec19"/>Creating a new C++ class</h1></div></div></div><p>We're now <a id="id68" class="indexterm"/>going to create a new C++ class with the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">To do this, from the Unreal editor, click on <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>New C++ Class</strong></span>. We'll be creating an Actor class, so select <span class="strong"><strong>Actor</strong></span> as the base class. Actors are the objects that are placed in the scene (anything from meshes, to lights, to sounds, and more).</li><li class="listitem">Next, enter a name for your new class, such as <code class="literal">MyNewActor</code>. Hit <span class="strong"><strong>Create Class</strong></span>. After it adds the files to the project, open <code class="literal">MyNewActor.h</code> in Visual Studio. When you create a new class using this interface, it will generate both a header file and a source file for your class.</li><li class="listitem">Let's just <a id="id69" class="indexterm"/>make our actor print a message to the output log when we start our game. To do this, we'll use the <code class="literal">BeginPlay</code> event. <code class="literal">BeginPlay</code> is called once the game has started (in a multiplayer game, this might be called after an initial countdown, but in our case, it will be called immediately).</li><li class="listitem">The <code class="literal">MyNewActor.h</code> file (which should already be open at this point) should contain the following code after the <code class="literal">GENERATED_BODY()</code> line:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public:   virtual void BeginPlay();</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">Then, in <code class="literal">MyNewActor.cpp</code>, add a log that prints <span class="strong"><strong>Hello, world!</strong></span> in the <code class="literal">void AnyNewActor::BeginPlay()</code> function, which runs as soon as the game starts:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">void AnyNewActor::BeginPlay()
{
    Super::BeginPlay();
    
    GEngine-&gt;AddOnScreenDebugMessage(-1, 15.0f, FColor::Yellow, TEXT("Hello World!"));
}</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">Then, switch back to the editor and click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Compile</strong></span> button in the main toolbar.</li><li class="listitem">Now that your actor class has compiled, we need to add it to the scene. To do this, navigate to the <span class="strong"><strong>Content Browser</strong></span> tab located at the bottom of the screen. Search for <code class="literal">MyNewActor</code> (there's a search bar to help you find it) and drag it into the scene view, which is the level viewport. It's invisible, so you won't see it or be able to click on it. However, if you scroll the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene/World Outliner</strong></span> pane (on the right-hand side) to the bottom, you should see the <span class="strong"><strong>MyNewActor1</strong></span> actor has been added to the scene:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04548_02_02.jpg" alt="Creating a new C++ class"/></div></li><li class="listitem">To test your <a id="id70" class="indexterm"/>new actor class, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> button. You should see a yellow <span class="strong"><strong>Hello, world!</strong></span> message printed to the console, as shown in the following screenshot. This can be seen in the <span class="strong"><strong>Output Log</strong></span> tab on the right-hand side of the <span class="strong"><strong>Content Browser</strong></span> tab at the bottom of the screen:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04548_02_03.jpg" alt="Creating a new C++ class"/></div></li></ol></div><p>Congratulations, you <a id="id71" class="indexterm"/>have created your first actor class in Unreal.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Blueprints"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec20"/>Blueprints</h1></div></div></div><p>Blueprints in <a id="id72" class="indexterm"/>Unreal is a C++ based visual scripting language built proprietary to Unreal. Blueprints will allow us to create code without the need to touch a line of text in an IDE such as Visual Studio. Instead, Blueprints allows us to create code through the use of drag and drop visual nodes, and connect them together to create nearly any kind of functionality you desire. Those of you who have come from UDK may find some similarity between Kismet and Blueprints, but unlike Kismet, Blueprints allows you to have full control over the creation and modification of functions and variables. It also compiles, which is something Kismet did not do.</p><p>Blueprints can inherit from C++ classes, or from other Blueprints. So, for instance, you might have an <code class="literal">Enemy</code> class. An enemy might have a<a id="id73" class="indexterm"/> <span class="strong"><strong>Health</strong></span> field, a <span class="strong"><strong>Speed</strong></span> field, an <a id="id74" class="indexterm"/><span class="strong"><strong>Attack</strong></span> field, and a <a id="id75" class="indexterm"/><span class="strong"><strong>Mesh</strong></span> field. You can then create multiple enemy templates by <a id="id76" class="indexterm"/>creating Blueprints that inherit from your <code class="literal">Enemy</code> class and changing each type of enemy's Health, Speed, Attack, and Mesh.</p><p>You can also expose parts of your C++ code to Blueprint graphs so that your Blueprint graphs and your core game code can communicate and work with each other. As an example, your inventory code may be implemented in C++, and it might expose functions to Blueprints so that a Blueprint graph can give items to the player.</p><div class="section" title="Creating a new Blueprint"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec34"/>Creating a new Blueprint</h2></div></div></div><p>The steps to<a id="id77" class="indexterm"/> create a new Blueprint are as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">In the <span class="strong"><strong>Content Browser</strong></span> pane, create a new Blueprint folder by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Add New</strong></span> drop-down list and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>New Folder</strong></span>, then renaming the folder <code class="literal">Blueprint</code>. Inside this folder, right-click and select <span class="strong"><strong>Blueprints</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Blueprint Class</strong></span>. Select <span class="strong"><strong>Actor</strong></span> as the parent class for the Blueprint.</li><li class="listitem">Next, give a name to your new Blueprint, such as <code class="literal">MyNewBlueprint</code>. To edit this Blueprint, double-click on its icon in the <span class="strong"><strong>Content Browser</strong></span> tab.</li><li class="listitem">Next, switch to the <span class="strong"><strong>Event Graph</strong></span> tab. </li><li class="listitem">If <span class="strong"><strong>Event Begin Play</strong></span> is not already there, right-click on the graph and expand <span class="strong"><strong>Add Event</strong></span>; then, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Event Begin Play</strong></span>. If you ever need to move around nodes such as <span class="strong"><strong>Event Begin Play</strong></span>, you can simply left-click on the node and drag it anywhere on the graph you want. You can also navigate through the graph by holding down the right-click mouse button and dragging across the screen:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04548_02_05.jpg" alt="Creating a new Blueprint"/></div><p>This will add a new event node to the graph.</p></li><li class="listitem">Next, right-click <a id="id78" class="indexterm"/>and begin typing <code class="literal">print</code> into the search bar. You should see the <span class="strong"><strong>Print String</strong></span> option in the list. Click on it to add a new <span class="strong"><strong>Print String</strong></span> node to your graph.</li><li class="listitem">Next, we want to have this node triggered when the <span class="strong"><strong>Event Begin Play</strong></span> node is triggered. To do this, drag from the output arrow of the <span class="strong"><strong>Event Begin Play</strong></span> node to the input arrow of the <span class="strong"><strong>Print String</strong></span> node:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04548_02_06.jpg" alt="Creating a new Blueprint"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Now, the <span class="strong"><strong>Print String</strong></span> node will be triggered when the game begins. However, let's take this one step further and add a variable to our Blueprint.</li><li class="listitem">On the left-hand <a id="id79" class="indexterm"/>side in the <span class="strong"><strong>My Blueprint</strong></span> pane, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Variable</strong></span> button.

Click on this to add the node to your graph:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04548_02_07.jpg" alt="Creating a new Blueprint"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Next, just as you did to connect <span class="strong"><strong>Event Begin Play</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Print String</strong></span> together, drag from the output arrow of the <span class="strong"><strong>Get My Print String</strong></span> node to the input pin of the <span class="strong"><strong>Print String</strong></span> node that is right next to the <span class="strong"><strong>In String</strong></span> label.</li><li class="listitem">Finally, switch <a id="id80" class="indexterm"/>over to the <span class="strong"><strong>Defaults</strong></span> tab. At the very top, under the <span class="strong"><strong>Defaults</strong></span> section, there should be a text field for editing the value of the <code class="literal">MyPrintString</code> variable. Enter whatever text you'd like into this field. Then, to save your Blueprint, first press the <span class="strong"><strong>Compile</strong></span> button in the <span class="strong"><strong>Blueprint</strong></span> window and then click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span> button next to it.</li></ol></div></div><div class="section" title="Adding a Blueprint to the scene"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec35"/>Adding a Blueprint to the scene</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that you've<a id="id81" class="indexterm"/> created the Blueprint, simply drag it from the <span class="strong"><strong>Content Browser</strong></span> tab into the scene.

<div class="section" title="Using Data Tables to import spreadsheet data"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec21"/>Using Data Tables to import spreadsheet data</h1></div></div></div><p>In Unreal, <span class="strong"><strong>Data Tables</strong></span> are <a id="id84" class="indexterm"/>a method of importing and using custom game data exported from a spreadsheet application. To do this, you first ensure that your spreadsheet follows some guidelines for format; additionally, you write a C++ struct that contains the data for one row of the spreadsheet. Then, you export a CSV file and select your C++ struct as the data type for that file.</p><div class="section" title="The spreadsheet format"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec37"/>The spreadsheet format</h2></div></div></div><p>Your <a id="id85" class="indexterm"/>spreadsheet must follow some simple rules in order to correctly export to Unreal.</p><p>The very first cell must remain blank.

Our class won't actually inherit from <code class="literal">Actor</code> (and, for that matter, it won't be a class), but doing this allows Unreal to generate some code in the background for us.</p><p>Next, open the <code class="literal">TestCustomData.h</code> file and replace the entire file with the following code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">#pragma once

}</pre></div><p>You will also need to add <code class="literal">#include TestCustomData.h</code> at the top of your <code class="literal">MyNewActor.cpp</code> file so that you can see the Data Table properties in it.</p><p>Compile the code in the editor. Next, open up the Blueprint you created from this actor class. Switch to the <span class="strong"><strong>Class Defaults</strong></span> tab and find the <span class="strong"><strong>My New Actor</strong></span> group (this should be at the very top).
