There is a very good reason why we are calling it the source code: it is the source from which we will build our binary executable code. The same C++ source code can be built on different platforms such as Mac, Windows, and iOS, and in theory, an executable code doing the exact same things on each respective platform should result.</p><p class="calibre9">In the not-so-distant past, before the introduction of C and C++, programmers wrote code for each specific machine they were targeting individually. They wrote code in a language called assembly language. But now, with C and C++ available, a programmer only has to write code once, and it can be deployed to a number of different machines simply by sending the same code through different compilers.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip06" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre9">In practice, there are some differences between Visual Studio's flavor of C++ and Xcode's flavor of C++, but these differences mostly come up when working with advanced C++ concepts, such as templates.</p><p class="calibre9">One of the main reasons why using UE4 is so helpful is that UE4 will erase a lot of the differences between Windows and Mac. The UE4 team did a lot of magic in order to get the same code to work on both Windows and Mac.</p></div><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note000001" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre9">
<strong class="calibre2">A real-world tip</strong>
</p><p class="calibre9">It is important for the code to run in the same way on all machines, especially for networked games or games that allow things such as shareable replays. This can be achieved using standards. For example, the IEEE floating-point standard is used to implement decimal math on all C++ compilers. This means that the result of computations such as <code class="email">200 * 3.14159</code> should be the same on all the machines.</p></div><p class="calibre9">Write the <a id="id27" class="calibre1"/>following code in Microsoft Visual Studio or in Xcode:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">#include &lt;iostream&gt;  // Import the input-output library
using namespace std; // allows us to write cout
                     // instead of std::cout
int main()
{
  cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, world" &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; "I am now a C++ programmer." &lt;&lt; endl;

}</pre></div><p class="calibre9">Press <em class="calibre10">Ctrl </em>+ <em class="calibre10">F5</em> to run the preceding code in Visual Studio, or press <img src="img/00015.jpeg" alt="Creating your first C++ program" class="calibre15"/>
<em class="calibre10"> </em>+ <em class="calibre10">R</em> to run in Xcode.</p><p class="calibre9">The first time you press <em class="calibre10">Ctrl </em>+ <em class="calibre10">F5</em> in Visual Studio, you will see this dialog:</p><div><img src="img/00016.jpeg" alt="Creating your first C++ program" class="calibre11"/></div><p class="calibre12"> </p><p class="calibre9">Select <strong class="calibre2">Yes</strong> and <strong class="calibre2">Do not show this dialog again</strong>—trust me, this will avoid future problems.</p><p class="calibre9">The first thing that might come to your mind is, "My! A whole lot of gibberish!"</p><p class="calibre9">Indeed, you rarely see the use of the hash (#) symbol (unless you use Twitter) and curly brace pairs <code class="email">{</code> <code class="email">}</code> in normal English texts. However, in C++ code, these strange symbols abound. You just have to get used to them.</p><p class="calibre9">So, let's interpret<a id="id28" class="calibre1"/> this program, starting from the first line.</p><p class="calibre9">This is the first line of the program:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">#include &lt;iostream&gt;  // Import the input-output library</pre></div><p class="calibre9">This line has two important points to be noted:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1">The first thing we see is an <code class="email">#include</code> statement. We are asking C++ to copy and paste the contents of another C++ source file, called <code class="email">&lt;iostream&gt;</code>, directly into our code file. The <code class="email">&lt;iostream&gt;</code> is a standard C++ library that handles all the sticky code that lets us print text to the screen.</li><li class="listitem" value="2">The second thing we notice is a <code class="email">//</code> comment. C++ ignores any text after a double slash (<code class="email">//</code>) until the end of that line. Comments are very useful to add in plain text explanations of what some code does. You might also see <code class="email">/* */</code> C-style comments in the source. Surrounding any text in C or C++ with slash-star <code class="email">/*</code> and star-slash <code class="email">*/</code> gives an instruction to have that code removed by the compiler.</li></ol><div></div><p class="calibre9">This is the next line of code:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">using namespace std; // allows us to write cout
                     // instead of std::cout</pre></div><p class="calibre9">The comments beside this line explain what the <code class="email">using</code> statement does: it just lets you use a shorthand (for example, <code class="email">cout</code>) instead of the fully qualified name (which, in this case, would be <code class="email">std::cout</code>) for a lot of our C++ code commands. Some people don't like a <code class="email">using namespace std;</code> statement; they prefer to write the <code class="email">std::cout</code> longhand every time they want to use <code class="email">cout</code>. You can get into long arguments over things like this. In this section of the text, we prefer the brevity that we get with the <code class="email">using namespace</code> <code class="email">std;</code> statement.</p><p class="calibre9">This is the next line:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">int main()</pre></div><p class="calibre9">This is the application's starting point. You can think of <code class="email">main</code> as the start line in a race. The <code class="email">int main()</code> statement is how your C++ program knows where to start; take a look at the following figure:</p><div><img src="img/00017.jpeg" alt="Creating your first C++ program" class="calibre11"/></div><p class="calibre12"> </p><p class="calibre9">If you don't have an <code class="email">int main()</code> program marker or if <code class="email">main</code> is spelled incorrectly, then your program just won't work because the program won't know where to start.</p><p class="calibre9">The next line is a character you don't see often:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">{</pre></div><p class="calibre9">This <code class="email">{</code> character is<a id="id29" class="calibre1"/> not a sideways mustache. It is called a curly brace, and it denotes the starting point of your program.</p><p class="calibre9">The next two lines print text to the screen:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, world" &lt;&lt; endl;
cout &lt;&lt; "I am now a C++ programmer." &lt;&lt; endl;</pre></div><p class="calibre9">The <code class="email">cout</code> statement stands for console output. Text between double quotes will get an output to the console exactly as it appears between the quotes. You can write anything you want between double quotes except a double quote and it will still be valid code.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip07" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre9">To enter a double quote between double quotes, you need to stick a backslash (<code class="email">\</code>) in front of the double quote character that you want inside the string, as shown here:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">cout &lt;&lt; "John shouted into the cave \"Hello!\" The cave echoed."</pre></div><p class="calibre9">The <code class="email">\</code> symbol is an example of an escape sequence. There are other escape sequences that you can use; the most common escape sequence you will find is <code class="email">\n</code>, which is used to jump the text output to the next line.</p></div><p class="calibre9">The last line of the program is the <code class="email">return</code> statement:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">return 0;</pre></div><p class="calibre9">This line of code indicates that the C++ program is quitting. You can think of the <code class="email">return</code> statement as returning to the operating system.</p><p class="calibre9">Finally, the end <a id="id30" class="calibre1"/>of your program is denoted by the closing curly brace, which is an opposite-facing sideways mustache:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">}</pre></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="ch01lvl2sec12" class="calibre1"/>Semicolons</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">Semicolons (;) are<a id="id31" class="calibre1"/> important in C++ programming. Notice in the preceding code example that most lines of code end in a semicolon. If you don't end each line with a semicolon, your code will not compile, and if that happens, you can be fired from your job.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_2"><a id="ch01lvl2sec13" class="calibre1"/>Handling errors</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">If you make <a id="id32" class="calibre1"/>a mistake while entering code, then you will have a syntax error. In the face of syntax errors, C++ will scream murder and your program will not even compile; also, it will not run.</p><p class="calibre9">Let's try to insert a couple of errors into our C++ code from earlier:</p><div><img src="img/00018.jpeg" alt="Handling errors" class="calibre11"/><div><p class="calibre16">Warning! This code listing contains errors. It is a good exercise to find all the errors and fix them!</p></div></div><p class="calibre12"> </p><p class="calibre9">As an exercise, try to find and fix all the errors in this program.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note05" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre9">Note that if you are extremely new to C++, this might be a hard exercise. However, this will show you how careful you need to be when writing C++ code.</p></div><p class="calibre9">Fixing compilation errors can be a nasty business. However, if you input the text of this program into your code editor and try to compile it, it will cause the compiler to report all the errors to you. Fix the errors, one at a time, and then try to recompile. A new error will pop up or the program will just work, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/00019.jpeg" alt="Handling errors" class="calibre11"/><div><p class="calibre16">Xcode shows you the errors in your code when you try to compile it</p></div></div><p class="calibre12"> </p><p class="calibre9">The reason <a id="id33" class="calibre1"/>I am showing you this sample program is to encourage the following workflow as long as you are new to C++:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1">Always start with a working C++ code example. You can fork off a bunch of new C++ programs from the <em class="calibre10">Your First C++ Program</em> section.</li><li class="listitem" value="2">Make your code modifications in small steps. When you are new, compile after writing each new line of code. Do not code for one to two hours and then compile all that new code at once.</li><li class="listitem" value="3">You can expect it to be a couple of months before you can write code that performs as expected the first time you write it. Don't get discouraged. Learning to code is fun.</li></ol><div></div></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_3"><a id="ch01lvl2sec14" class="calibre1"/>Warnings</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">The<a id="id34" class="calibre1"/> compiler will flag things that it thinks might be mistakes. These are another class of compiler notices known as warnings. Warnings are problems in your code that you do not have to fix for your code to run but are simply recommended to be fixed by the compiler. Warnings are often indications of code that is not quite perfect, and fixing warnings in code is generally considered good practice.</p><p class="calibre9">However, not all warnings are going to cause problems in your code. Some programmers prefer to disable the warnings that they do not consider to be an issue (for example, warning 4018 warns against signed/unsigned mismatch, which you will most likely see later).</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch01lvl1sec14" class="calibre1"/>What is building and compiling?</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">You<a id="id35" class="calibre1"/> might have heard of a computer process term called compiling. Compiling <a id="id36" class="calibre1"/>is the process of converting your C++ program into code that can run on a CPU. Building your source code<a id="id37" class="calibre1"/> means the same thing as compiling it.</p><p class="calibre9">See, your source <code class="email">code.cpp</code> file will not actually run on a computer. It has to be compiled first for it to run.</p><p class="calibre9">This is the whole point of using Microsoft Visual Studio Express or Xcode. Visual Studio and Xcode are both compilers. You can write C++ source code in any text-editing program—even in Notepad. But you need a compiler to run it on your machine.</p><p class="calibre9">Every operating system typically has one or more C++ compilers that can compile C++ code to run on that platform. On Windows, you have Visual Studio and Intel C++ Studio compiler. On Mac, there is Xcode, and on all of Windows, Mac, and Linux, there is <a id="id38" class="calibre1"/>the <strong class="calibre2">GNU Compiler Collection</strong> (<strong class="calibre2">GCC</strong>).</p><p class="calibre9">The same C++ code that we write (Source) can be compiled using different compilers for different operating systems, and in theory, they should produce the same result. The ability to compile the same code on different platforms is called portability. In general, portability is a good thing.</p></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="ch01lvl2sec15" class="calibre1"/>Scripting</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">There is<a id="id39" class="calibre1"/> another class of programming languages called scripting languages. These <a id="id40" class="calibre1"/>include languages such as PHP, Python, and ActionScript. Scripted languages are not compiled—for JavaScript, PHP, and ActionScript, there is no compilation step. Rather, they are interpreted from the source as the program is run. The good thing about scripting languages is that they are usually platform-independent from the first go, because interpreters are very carefully designed to be platform-independent.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch01lvl3sec01" class="calibre1"/>Exercise – ASCII art</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">Game programmers <a id="id41" class="calibre1"/>love ASCII art. You can draw a picture using only characters. Here's an example of an ASCII art maze:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">cout &lt;&lt; "****************" &lt;&lt; endl;
cout &lt;&lt; "*............*.*" &lt;&lt; endl;
cout &lt;&lt; "*.*.*******..*.*" &lt;&lt; endl;
cout &lt;&lt; "*.*.*..........*" &lt;&lt; endl;
cout &lt;&lt; "*.*.*.**********" &lt;&lt; endl;
