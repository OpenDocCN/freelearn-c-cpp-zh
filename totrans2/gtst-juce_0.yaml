- en: JUCE is a framework for developing cross-platform software in C++. JUCE itself
    comprises of a wide range of classes that solve common problems encountered when
    developing software systems. These include handling graphics, sound, user interaction,
    networks, and so on. Due to its level of audio support JUCE is popular for developing
    audio applications and audio plugins, although this is by no means limits its
    use to this domain. It is relatively easy to get started with JUCE, and each JUCE
    class offers few surprises. At the same time, JUCE is powerful and customizable
    with little effort.

    *Installing JUCE and the Introjucer Application*, guides the user through installing
    JUCE and covers the structure of the source code tree, including some of the useful
    tools available for creating JUCE projects. By the end of this chapter, the user
    will have installed JUCE, created a basic project using the Introjucer application
    and be familiar with the JUCE documentation.'

    Interfaces*, covers the JUCE `Component` class, which is the main building block
    for creating graphical user interfaces in JUCE. By the end of this chapter, the
    user will be able to create basic user interfaces and perform fundamental drawing
    within a component. The user will also have the skills required to design and
    build more complex interfaces.'

    Structures*, describes JUCE''s important data structures, many of which could
    be seen as replacements for some of the standard library classes. This chapter
    also introduces the essential classes for JUCE development. By the end of this
    chapter, the user will be able to create and manipulate data in a range of JUCE''s
    essential classes.'

    JUCE provides its own classes for reading and writing files and many helper classes
    for specific media formats. This chapter introduces the main examples of these
    classes. By the end of this chapter, the user will be able to manipulate a range
    of media files using JUCE.'

    In addition to the essential classes introduced in earlier chapters, JUCE includes
    a range of classes for solving common problems in application development. By
    the end of this chapter, the user will have an awareness of some of the additional,
    helpful utilities offered by JUCE.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will need a Mac OS X or Windows computer that supports an appropriate **Integrated
    Development Environment** (**IDE**). Any relatively recent computer should be
    sufficient. On Mac OS X, you should be running the Mac OS X 10.7 "*Lion*" operating
    system (or later). Most relatively recent Windows computers will support an appropriate
    version of the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE. Setting up the IDE for JUCE development
    is covered in [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Installing JUCE and the Introjucer
    Application"), *Installing JUCE and the Introjucer Application*.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for programmers with a basic grasp of C++. The examples start from
    a basic level, making few assumptions beyond fundamental C++ concepts. For example,
    not even an understanding of the C++ Standard Library is needed. Those without
    any experience with C++ should be able to follow and construct the examples, although
    may need further support to understand the fundamental concepts. Experienced programmers
    should also find they get to grips the JUCE library more quickly.
