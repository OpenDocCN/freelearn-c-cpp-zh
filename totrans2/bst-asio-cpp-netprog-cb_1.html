Some applications have communication as their main function, for example, instant messengers, e-mail servers and clients, file download software, and so on. Others have the network communication layer as a fundamental component, on top of which the main functionality is built. Some of the examples of such applications are web browsers, network file systems, distributed database management systems, media streaming software, online games, offline games with multiplayer over the network option support, and many others. Besides, nowadays almost any application in addition to its main functionality provides supplementary functions, involving network communication. The most prominent examples of such functions are online registration and automatic software update. In the latter case, the update package is downloaded from the application developer's remote server and installed on the user's computer or mobile device.</p><p>The application that consists of two or more parts, each of which runs on a separate computing device, and communicates with other parts over a computer network is called a<a id="id0" class="indexterm"/> <strong>distributed application</strong>. For example, a web server and a web browser together can be considered as one complex distributed application. The browser running on a user's computer communicates with the web server running on a different remote computer in order to achieve a common goal—to transmit and display a web page requested by the user.</p><p>Distributed <a id="id1" class="indexterm"/>applications provide significant benefits as compared to traditional applications running on a single computer. The most valuable of them are the following:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Ability to transmit data between two or more remote computing devices. This is absolutely obvious and the most valuable benefit of distributed software.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Ability to connect computers in a network and install special software on them, creating powerful computing systems that can perform tasks that can't otherwise be performed on a single computer in an adequate amount of time.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Ability to effectively store and share data in a network. In a computer network, a single device can be used as data storage to store big amounts of data and other devices can easily request some portions of that data when necessary without the need to keep the copy of all data on each device. As an example, consider large datacenters hosting hundreds of millions of websites. The end user can request the web page they need anytime by sending the request to the server over the network (usually, the Internet). There is no need to keep the copy of the website on the user's device. There is a single storage of the data (a website) and millions of users can request the data from that storage if and when this information is needed.</li></ul></div><p>For two applications running on different computing devices to communicate with each other, they need to agree on a communication protocol. Of course, the developer of the distributed application is free to implement his or her own protocol. However, this would be rarely the case at least for two reasons. First, developing such a protocol is an enormously complex and time-consuming task. Secondly, such protocols are already defined, standardized, and even implemented in all popular operating systems including Windows, Mac OS X, and majority of the distributions of Linux.</p><p>These protocols are defined by the TCP/IP standard. Don't be fooled by the standard's name; it defines not only TCP and IP but many more other protocols, comprising a TCP/IP protocol stack with one or more protocols on each level of the stack. Distributed software developers usually deal with transport level protocols such as TCP or UDP. Lower layer protocols are usually hidden from the developer and are handled by the operating system and network devices.</p><p>In this book, we only touch upon TCP and UDP protocols that satisfy the needs of most developers of distributed software. If the reader is not familiar with the TCP/IP protocol stack, the OSI model, or TCP and UDP protocols, it's highly advised to read some theory on these topics. Though this book provides some brief information about them, it is mostly focused on practical aspects of using TCP and UDP protocols in distributed software development.</p><p>The <a id="id2" class="indexterm"/>TCP protocol is a transport layer protocol with the following characteristics:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It's reliable, which means that this protocol guarantees delivery of the messages in proper order or a notification that the message has not been delivered. The protocol includes error handling mechanisms, which frees the developer from the need to implement them in the application.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It assumes logical connection establishment. Before one application can communicate with another over the TCP protocol, it must establish a logical connection by exchanging service messages according to the standard.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It assumes the point-to-point communication model. That is, only two applications can communicate over a single connection. No multicast messaging is supported.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It is stream-oriented. This means that the data being sent by one application to another is interpreted by the protocol as a stream of bytes. In practice, it means that if a sender application sends a particular block of data, there is no guarantee that it will be delivered to the receiver application as the same block of data in a single turn, that is, the sent message may be broken into as many parts as the protocol <em>wants</em> and each of them will be delivered separately, though in correct order.</li></ul></div><p>The UDP protocol<a id="id3" class="indexterm"/> is a transport layer protocol having different (in some sense opposite) characteristics from those of the TCP protocol. The following are its characteristics:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It's unreliable, which means that if a sender sends a message over a UDP protocol, there is no guarantee that the message will be delivered. The protocol won't try to detect or fix any errors. The developer is responsible for all error handling.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It's connectionless, meaning that no connection establishment is needed before the applications can communicate.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It supports both one-to-one and one-to-many communication models. Multicast messages are supported by the protocol.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It's datagram oriented. This means that the protocol interprets data as messages of a particular size and will try to deliver them as a whole. The message (datagram) either will be delivered as a whole, or if the protocol fails to do that <a id="id4" class="indexterm"/>won't be delivered at all.</li></ul></div><p>Because the UDP protocol is unreliable, it is usually used in reliable local networks. To use it for communication over the Internet (which is an unreliable network), the developer must implement error handling mechanisms in its application.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"/>Note</h3><p>When there is a need to communicate over the Internet, the TCP protocol is most often the best choice due to its reliability.</p></div></div><p>As it has already been mentioned, both TCP and UDP protocols and the underlying protocols required by them are implemented by most popular operating systems. A developer of a distributed application is provided an API through which it can use protocols implementation. The TCP/IP standard does not standardize the protocol API implementation; therefore, several API implementations exist. However, the one based on <strong>Berkeley Sockets API</strong>
<a id="id5" class="indexterm"/> is the most widely used.</p><p>Berkeley Sockets API is the name of one of the many possible implementations of TCP and UDP protocols' API. This API was developed at the Berkeley University of California, USA (hence the name) in the early 1980s. It is built around a concept of an abstract object called a <a id="id6" class="indexterm"/>
<strong>socket</strong>. Such a name was given to this object in order to draw the analogy with a usual electrical socket. However, this idea seems to have somewhat failed due to the fact that Berkeley Sockets turned out to be a significantly more complex concept.</p><p>Now Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux operating systems all have this API implemented (though with some minor variations) and software developers can use it to consume TCP and UDP protocols' functionality when developing distributed applications.</p><div><img src="img/B00298_01_01.jpg" alt="Introduction"/></div><p>Though very popular and widely used, Sockets API<a id="id7" class="indexterm"/> has several flaws. First, because it was designed as a very generic API that should support many different protocols, it is quite complex and somewhat difficult to use. The second flaw is that this is a C-style functional API with a poor type system, which makes it error prone and even more difficult to use. For example, Sockets API doesn't provide a separate type representing a socket. Instead, the built-in type <code class="literal">int</code> is used, which means that by mistake any value of the <code class="literal">int</code> type can be passed as an argument to the function expecting a socket, and the compiler won't detect the mistake. This may lead to run-time crashes, the root cause of which is hard to find.</p><p>Network programming <a id="id8" class="indexterm"/>is inherently complex and doing it with a low-level C-style socket API makes it even more complex and error prone. Boost.Asio is an O-O C++ library that is, just like raw Sockets API, built around the concept of a <em>socket</em>. Roughly speaking, Boost.Asio wraps raw Sockets API and provides the developer with O-O interface to it. It is intended to simplify network programming in <a id="id9" class="indexterm"/>several ways as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It hides the raw C-style API and providing a user with an object-oriented API</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It provides a rich-type system, which makes code more readable and allows it to catch many errors at compilation time</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">As Boost.Asio is a cross-platform library, it simplifies development of cross-platform distributed applications</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It provides auxiliary functionality such as scatter-gather I/O operations, stream-based I/O, exception-based error handling, and others</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The library is designed so that it can be relatively easily extended to add new custom <a id="id10" class="indexterm"/>functionality</li></ul></div><p>This chapter introduces essential Boost.Asio classes and demonstrates how to perform basic operations with them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec10"/>Creating an endpoint</h1></div></div></div><p>A typical client application, before it can communicate with a server application to consume its services, must obtain the IP address of the host on which the server application is running and the protocol port number associated with it. A pair of values consisting of an IP address and a protocol port number that uniquely identifies a particular application running on a particular host in a computer network is<a id="id11" class="indexterm"/> called an <strong>endpoint</strong>.</p><p>The client application will <a id="id12" class="indexterm"/>usually obtain the IP address and the port number identifying the server application either from the user directly through the application UI or as command-line arguments or will read it from the application's configuration file.</p><p>The IP address can be represented as a string containing an address in dot-decimal notation if it is an IPv4 address (for example, <code class="literal">192.168.10.112</code>) or in hexadecimal notation if it is an IPv6 address (for example, <code class="literal">FE36::0404:C3FA:EF1E:3829</code>). Besides, the server IP address can be provided to the client application in an indirect form, as a string containing a DNS name (for example, <code class="literal">localhost</code> or <a class="ulink" href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a>). Another way to represent an IP address is an integer value. The IPv4 address is represented as a 32-bit integer and IPv6 as a 64-bit integer. However, due to poor readability and memorability this representation is used extremely rarely.</p><p>If the client application is provided with a DNS name before it can communicate with the server application, it must resolve the DNS name to obtain the actual IP address of the host running the server application. Sometimes, the DNS name may map to multiple IP addresses, in which case the client may want to try addresses one by one until it finds the one that works. We'll consider a recipe describing how to resolve DNS names with Boost.Asio later in this chapter.</p><p>The server application needs to deal with endpoints too. It uses the endpoint to specify to the operating system on which the IP address and protocol port it wants to listen for incoming messages from the clients. If the host running the server application has only one network interface and a single IP address assigned to it, the server application has only one option as to on which address to listen. However, sometimes the host might have more than one network interface and correspondingly more than one IP address. In this situation, the server application encounters a difficult problem of selecting an appropriate IP address on which to listen for incoming messages. The problem is that the application knows nothing about details such as underlying IP protocol settings, packet routing rules, DNS names which are mapped to the corresponding IP addresses, and so on. Therefore, it is quite a complex task (and sometimes even not solvable) for the server application to foresee through which IP address the messages sent by clients will be delivered to the host.</p><p>If the server <a id="id13" class="indexterm"/>application chooses only one IP address to listen for incoming messages, it may miss messages routed to other IP addresses of the host. Therefore, the server application usually wants to listen on all IP addresses available on the host. This guarantees that the server application will receive all messages arriving at any IP address and the particular protocol port.</p><p>To sum up, the<a id="id14" class="indexterm"/> endpoints serve two goals:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The client application uses an endpoint to designate a particular server application it wants to communicate with.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The server application uses an endpoint to specify a local IP address and a port number on which it wants to receive incoming messages from clients. If there is more than one IP address on the host, the server application will want to create a special endpoint representing all IP addresses at once.</li></ul></div><p>This recipe explains how to create endpoints in Boost.Asio both in client and server applications.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec12"/>Getting ready</h2></div></div></div><p>Before creating the endpoint, the client application must obtain the raw IP address and the protocol port number designating the server it will communicate with. The server application on the other hand, as it usually listens for incoming messages on all IP addresses, only needs to obtain a port number on which to listen.</p><p>Here, we don't consider how the application obtains a raw IP address or a port number. In the following recipes, we assume that the IP address and the port number have already been obtained by the application and are available at the beginning of the corresponding algorithm.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec13"/>How to do it…</h2></div></div></div><p>The following <a id="id15" class="indexterm"/>algorithms and corresponding code samples demonstrate two common scenarios of creating an endpoint.

The second one demonstrates how the server application creates an endpoint to specify on which IP addresses and port it wants to listen for incoming messages from clients.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec01"/>Creating an endpoint in the client to designate the server</h3></div></div></div><p>The following algorithm<a id="id16" class="indexterm"/> describes steps required to perform in the client application to create an endpoint designating a server application the client wants to communicate with.

  return 0;
}</pre></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec14"/>How it works…</h2></div></div></div><p>Let's consider<a id="id19" class="indexterm"/> the first code sample. The algorithm it implements is applicable in an application playing a role of a client that is an application that actively initiates the communication session with a server. The client application needs to be provided an IP address and a protocol port number of the server. Here we assume that those values have already been obtained and are available at the beginning of the algorithm, which makes step 1 details a given.</p><p>Having obtained the raw IP address, the client application must represent it in terms of the Boost.Asio type system. Boost.Asio provides three classes used to represent an IP address:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">asio::ip::address_v4</code>: This represents an IPv4 address</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">asio::ip::address_v6</code>: This represents an IPv6 address</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">asio::ip::address</code>: This IP-protocol-version-agnostic class can represent both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses</li></ul></div><p>In our sample, we<a id="id20" class="indexterm"/> use the <code class="literal">asio::ip::address</code> class, which makes the client application IP-protocol-version-agnostic. This means that it can transparently work with both IPv4 and IPv6 servers.</p><p>In step 2, we use the <code class="literal">asio::ip::address</code> class's static method, <code class="literal">from_string()</code>. This method accepts a raw IP address represented as a string, parses and validates the string, instantiates an object of the <code class="literal">asio::ip::address</code> class, and returns it to the caller. This method has four overloads. In our sample we use this one:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">static asio::ip::address from_string(
    const std::string &amp; str,
    boost::system::error_code &amp; ec);</pre></div><p>This method is very useful as it checks whether the string passed to it as an argument contains a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address and if it does, instantiates a corresponding object. If the address is invalid, the method will designate an error through the second argument. It means that this function can be used to validate the raw user input.</p><p>In step 3, we instantiate an object of the <code class="literal">boost::asio::ip::tcp::endpoint</code> class, passing the IP address and a protocol port number to its constructor. Now, the <code class="literal">ep</code> object can be used to designate a server application in the Boost.Asio communication related functions.</p><p>The second sample has a similar idea, although it somewhat differs from the first one. The server application is usually provided only with the protocol port number on which it should listen for incoming messages. The IP address is not provided because the server application usually wants to listen for the incoming messages on all IP addresses available on the host, not only on a specific one.</p><p>To represent the concept of <em>all IP addresses available on the host</em>, the classes <code class="literal">asio::ip::address_v4</code> and <code class="literal">asio::ip::address_v6</code> provide a static method <code class="literal">any()</code>, which instantiates a special object of corresponding class representing the concept. In step 2, we use the <code class="literal">any()</code> method of the <code class="literal">asio::ip::address_v6</code> class to instantiate such a special object.</p><p>Note that the IP-protocol-version-agnostic class <code class="literal">asio::ip::address</code> does not provide the <code class="literal">any()</code> method. The server application must explicitly specify whether it wants to receive requests either on IPv4 or on IPv6 addresses by using the object returned by the <code class="literal">any()</code> method of either the <code class="literal">asio::ip::address_v4</code> or <code class="literal">asio::ip::address_v6</code> class correspondingly. In step 2 of our second sample, we assume that our server communicates over IPv6 protocol and therefore called the <code class="literal">any()</code> method of the <code class="literal">asio::ip::address_v6</code> class.</p><p>In step 3, we create an endpoint object which represents all IP addresses available on the host and a particular protocol port number.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec15"/>There's more...</h2></div></div></div><p>In both our previous<a id="id21" class="indexterm"/> samples we used the <code class="literal">endpoint</code> class declared in the scope of the <code class="literal">asio::ip::tcp</code> class. If we look at the declaration of the <code class="literal">asio::ip::tcp</code> class, we'll see something like this:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">class tcp
{
public:
  /// The type of a TCP endpoint.
<strong>  typedef basic_endpoint&lt;tcp&gt; endpoint;</strong>

  //...
}</pre></div><p>It means that this <code class="literal">endpoint</code> class is a specialization of the <code class="literal">basic_endpoint&lt;&gt;</code> template class that is intended for use in clients and servers communicating over the TCP protocol.</p><p>However, creating endpoints that can be used in clients and servers that communicate over the UDP protocol is just as easy. To represent such an endpoint, we need to use the <code class="literal">endpoint</code> class declared in the scope of the <code class="literal">asio::ip::udp</code> class. The following code snippet demonstrates how this <code class="literal">endpoint</code> class is declared:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">class udp
{
public:
  /// The type of a UDP endpoint.
<strong>  typedef basic_endpoint&lt;udp&gt; endpoint;</strong>

  //...
}</pre></div><p>For example, if we want to create an endpoint in our client application to designate a server with which we want to communicate over the UDP protocol, we would only slightly change the implementation of step 3 in our sample. This is how that step would look like with changes highlighted:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">// Step 3.
asio::ip::<strong>udp</strong>::endpoint ep(ip_address, port_num);</pre></div><p>All other code would not need to be changed as it is transport protocol independent.</p><p>The same trivial change in the implementation of step 3 in our second sample is required to switch from a server communicating over TCP to one communicating over UDP.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec16"/>See also</h2></div></div></div><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <em>Binding a socket to an endpoint</em> recipe explains how the endpoint object is used in a server application</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <em>Connecting a socket</em> recipe explains how the endpoint object is used in a client application</li></ul></div></div></div>

Moreover, it tells us almost nothing about how to implement the TCP or UDP protocol software API through which this software functionality can be consumed by the application.</p><p>If we look at section 3.8, <em>Interface</em>, of the RFC document <em>#793</em> which describes the TCP protocol, we'll find out that it contains only functional requirements of a minimal set of functions that the TCP protocol software API must provide. A developer of the protocol software is given full control over all other aspects of the API, such as the structure of the API, names of the functions comprising the API, the object model, the abstractions involved, additional auxiliary functions, and so on. Every developer of the TCP protocol software is free to choose the way to implement the interface to his or her protocol implementation.</p><p>The same story applies with the UDP protocol: only a small set of functional requirements of mandatory operations are described in the RFC document <em>#768</em> devoted to it. The control of all other aspects of the UDP protocol software API is reserved for the developer of this API.</p><p>As it has already been mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, Berkeley Sockets API is the most popular TCP and UDP protocols' API. It is designed around the concept of a socket—an abstract object representing a communication session context. Before we can perform any network I/O operations, we must first allocate a socket object and then associate each I/O operation with it.</p><p>Boost.Asio<a id="id23" class="indexterm"/> borrows many concepts from Berkeley Sockets API and is so much similar to it that we can call it "an object oriented Berkeley Sockets API". The Boost.Asio library includes a class representing a socket concept, which provides interface methods similar to those found in Berkeley Sockets API.</p><p>Basically, there are two types of sockets.

<a id="id25" class="indexterm"/> is the one used to passively wait for incoming connection requests from remote applications. Passive sockets don't take part in user data transmission.

This class is a central component in the Boost.Asio I/O infrastructure. It provides access to the network I/O services of the underlying operating system. Boost.Asio sockets get access to those services through the object of this class. Therefore, all socket class constructors require an object of <code class="literal">asio::io_service</code> as an argument. We'll consider the <code class="literal">asio::io_service</code> class in more detail in the following chapters.</p><p>In the next step, we create an instance of the <code class="literal">asio::ip::tcp</code> class. This class represents a TCP protocol. It provides no functionality, but rather acts like a data structure that contains a set of values that describe the protocol.</p><p>The <code class="literal">asio::ip::tcp</code> class doesn't have a public constructor. Instead, it provides two static methods, <code class="literal">asio::ip::tcp::v4()</code> and <code class="literal">asio::ip::tcp::v6()</code>, that return an object of the <code class="literal">asio::ip::tcp</code> class representing the TCP protocol with the underlying IPv4 or IPv6 protocol correspondingly.</p><p>Besides, the <code class="literal">asio::ip::tcp</code> class contains declarations of some basic types intended to be used with the TCP protocol. Among them are <code class="literal">asio::tcp::endpoint</code>, <code class="literal">asio::tcp::socket</code>, <code class="literal">asio::tcp::acceptor</code>, and others. Let's have a look at those declarations found in the <code class="literal">boost/asio/ip/tcp.hpp</code> file:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">namespace boost {

Note that this constructor does not allocate the underlying operating system's socket object. The real operating system's socket is allocated in step 4 when we call the <code class="literal">open()</code> method and pass an object specifying protocol to it as an argument.</p><p>In Boost.Asio, <em>opening</em> a socket means associating it with full set of parameters describing a specific protocol over which the socket is intended to be communicating. When the Boost.Asio socket object is provided with these parameters, it has enough information to allocate a real socket object of the underlying operating system.</p><p>The <code class="literal">asio::ip::tcp::socket</code> class provides another constructor that accepts a protocol object as an argument.

Usually, these parameters are supplied by a user through the client application's UI or as command-line arguments. The process of obtaining and validating these parameters is behind the scope of this recipe; therefore, here we assume that they are available at the beginning of the sample.</p><p>Then, in step 2, we create an instance of the <code class="literal">asio::io_service</code> class that is used by the resolver to access underlying OS's services during a DNS name resolution process.</p><p>In step 3 we create an object of the <code class="literal">asio::ip::tcp::resolver::query</code> class. This object represents a query to the DNS. It contains a DNS name to resolve, a port number that will be used to construct an endpoint object after the DNS name resolution and a set of flags controlling some specific aspects of resolution process, represented as a bitmap. All these values are passed to the query class's constructor. Because the service is specified as a protocol port number (in our case, <code class="literal">3333</code>) and not as a service name (for example, HTTP, FTP, and so on), we passed the <code class="literal">asio::ip::tcp::resolver::query::numeric_service</code> flag to explicitly inform the query object about that, so that it properly parses the port number value.</p><p>In step 4, we create an instance of the <code class="literal">asio::ip::tcp::resolver</code> class. This class provides the DNS name resolution functionality. To perform the resolution, it requires services of the underlying operating system and it gets access to them through the object of the <code class="literal">asio::io_services</code> class being passed to its constructor as an argument.</p><p>The DNS name resolution is performed in step 5 in the resolver object's <code class="literal">resolve()</code> method. The method overload we use in our sample accepts objects of the <code class="literal">asio::ip::tcp::resolver::query</code> and <code class="literal">system::error_code</code> classes. The latter object will contain information describing the error if the method fails.</p><p>If successful, the method returns an object of the <code class="literal">asio::ip::tcp::resolver::iterator</code> class, which is an iterator pointing to the first element of a collection representing resolution results. The collection contains objects of the <code class="literal">asio::ip::basic_resolver_entry&lt;tcp&gt;</code> class. There are as many objects in the collection as the total number of IP addresses that resolution yielded. Each collection element contains an object of the <code class="literal">asio::ip::tcp::endpoint</code> class instantiated from one IP address resulting from the resolution process and a port number provided with the corresponding <code class="literal">query</code> object. The <code class="literal">endpoint</code> object can be accessed through the <code class="literal">asio::ip::basic_resolver_entry&lt;tcp&gt;::endopoint()</code> getter method.</p><p>The default-constructed object of the <code class="literal">asio::ip::tcp::resolver::iterator</code> class represents an end iterator.

The common approach in this case is to try to communicate with each endpoint one by one, until the desired response is received.</p><p>Note that when<a id="id41" class="indexterm"/> the DNS name is mapped to more than one IP address and some of them are IPv4 and others are IPv6 addresses, the DNS name may be resolved either to the IPv4 address or to the IPv6 address or to both.

The process of associating a socket with a particular endpoint is called<a id="id44" class="indexterm"/> <strong>binding</strong>. When a socket is bound to an endpoint, all network packets coming into the host from the network with that endpoint as their target address will be redirected to that particular socket by the operating system. Likewise, all the data coming out from a socket bound to a particular endpoint will be output from the host to the network through a network interface associated with the corresponding IP address specified in that endpoint.</p><p>Some operations bind unbound sockets implicitly. For example, an operation that connects an unbound active socket to a remote application, binds it implicitly to an IP address and a protocol port number chosen by the underlying operating system. Usually, the client application doesn't need to explicitly bind an active socket to a specific endpoint just because it doesn't need that specific endpoint to communicate with the server; it only needs <em>any</em> endpoint for that purpose. Therefore, it usually delegates the right to choose the IP address and the port number to which the socket should be bound to the operating system. However, in some special cases, the client application might need to use a specific IP address and a protocol port number to communicate with the remote application and therefore will bind its socket explicitly to that specific endpoint. We wouldn't consider these cases in our book.</p><p>When socket binding is delegated to the operating system, there is no guarantee that it will be bound to the same endpoint each time. Even if there is a single network interface and a single IP address on the host, the socket may be bound to a different protocol port number every time the implicit binding is performed.</p><p>Unlike client applications that usually don't care through which IP address and protocol port number its active socket will be communicating with the remote application, the server application usually needs to bind its acceptor socket to a particular endpoint explicitly.

Therefore, we don't need to create another object representing the protocol to pass it to the acceptor socket's constructor. Instead, we use the endpoint's <code class="literal">protocol()</code> method, which returns an object of the <code class="literal">asio::ip::tcp</code> class representing the corresponding protocols.</p><p>The binding is performed in step 4. This is quite a simple operation. We call the acceptor socket's <code class="literal">bind()</code> method, passing an object representing an endpoint to which the acceptor socket should be bound as an argument of the method. If the call succeeds, the acceptor socket is bound to the corresponding endpoint and is ready to start listening for incoming connection requests on that endpoint.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip02"/>Tip</h3><p>

According to the TCP protocol, the <em>connection establishment process</em> lies in exchanging of service messages between two applications, which, if succeeds, results in two applications being <em>logically connected</em> and ready for communication with each other.</p><p>Roughly, the connection establishment process looks like this. The client application, when it wants to communicate with the server application, creates and opens an active socket and issues a <code class="literal">connect()</code> command on it, specifying a target server application with an endpoint object. This leads to a connection establishment request message being sent to the server application over the network. The server application receives the request and creates an active socket on its side, marking it as connected to a specific client and replies back to the client with the message acknowledging that connection is successfully set up on the server side. Next, the client having received the acknowledgement from the server, marks its socket as connected to the server, and sends one more message to it acknowledging that the connection is successfully set up on the client side. When the server receives the acknowledgement message from the client, the logical connection between two applications is considered established.</p><p>The point-to-point communication model is assumed between two connected sockets. This means that if socket A is connected to socket B, both can only communicate with each other and cannot communicate with any other socket C. Before socket A can communicate with socket C, it must close the connection with socket B and establish a new connection with socket C.</p><p>This recipe explains how to synchronously connect a socket to a remote application with Boost.Asio.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec32"/>How to do it…</h2></div></div></div><p>The following algorithm descries steps required to perform in the TCP client application to connect an active socket to the server application:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Obtain the target server application's IP address and a protocol port number.</li><li class="listitem">Create an object of the <code class="literal">asio::ip::tcp::endpoint</code> class from the IP address and the protocol port number obtained in step 1.</li><li class="listitem">Create and open an active socket.</li><li class="listitem">Call the socket's <code class="literal">connect()</code> method specifying the endpoint object created in step 2 as an argument.</li><li class="listitem">If the method succeeds, the socket is considered connected and can be used to send and receive data to and from the server.</li></ol></div><p>The following code<a id="id50" class="indexterm"/> sample demonstrates a possible implementation of the algorithm:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">#include &lt;boost/asio.hpp&gt;

However, sometimes the client application is provided with a DNS name that may be mapped to one or more IP addresses. In this case, we first need to resolve the DNS name using the <code class="literal">resolve()</code> method provided by the <code class="literal">asio::ip::tcp::resolver</code> class. This method resolves a DNS name, creates an object of the <code class="literal">asio::ip::tcp::endpoint</code> class from each IP address resulted from resolution, puts all endpoint objects in a collection, and returns an object of the <code class="literal">asio::ip::tcp::resolver::iterator</code> class, which is an iterator pointing to the first element in the collection.</p><p>When a DNS name resolves to multiple IP addresses, the client application—when deciding to which one to connect—usually has no reasons to prefer one IP address to any other. The common approach in this situation is to iterate through endpoints in the collection and try to connect to each of them one by one until the connection succeeds. Boost.Asio provides auxiliary functionality that implements this approach.</p><p>The free function <code class="literal">asio::connect()</code> accepts an active socket object and an object of the <code class="literal">asio::ip::tcp::resolver::iterator</code> class as input arguments, iterates over a collection of endpoints, and tries to connect the socket to each endpoint. The function stops iteration, and returns when it either successfully connects a socket to one of the endpoints or when it has tried all the endpoints and failed to connect the socket to all of them.</p><p>The following algorithm<a id="id52" class="indexterm"/> demonstrates steps required to connect a socket to a server application represented by a DNS name and a protocol port number:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Obtain the DNS name of a host running the server application and the server's port number and represent them as strings.</li><li class="listitem">Resolve a DNS name using the <code class="literal">asio::ip::tcp::resolver</code> class.</li><li class="listitem">Create an active socket without opening it.</li><li class="listitem">Call the <code class="literal">asio::connect()</code> function passing a socket object and an iterator object obtained in step 2 to it as arguments.</li></ol></div><p>The following code sample demonstrates possible implementation of the algorithm:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">#include &lt;boost/asio.hpp&gt;
