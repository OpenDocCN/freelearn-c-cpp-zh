- en: Cinder is one of the most exciting frameworks available for creative coding.
    It is developed in C++ for increased performance and allows for the fast creation
    of visually complex and interactive applications. The big advantage of Cinder
    is that it can target many platforms such as Mac, Windows, and iOS with the exact
    same code.
