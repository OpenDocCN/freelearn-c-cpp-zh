- en: What do humans and machines really have in common, in the non-Turing sense of
    the word? It seems like the everyday life of an average human nowadays is almost
    synonymous with operating the large number of contraptions our species has created,
    yet most of us don't even speak the same language as the devices we use, which
    creates a need for some kind of translation. Now it's not as if we can't learn
    how to speak to machines directly, but it's simply too tedious and time-consuming
    as our brains work in a completely different way to a common processor. A gray
    area exists in which relatively intuitive actions performed by humans can also
    be understood and interpreted by machines without the need for ever getting involved
    with the underlying complexities - the means of interfacing.

    is inside an element. Calculating intersections using its normal position yields
    incorrect results because of its relativity to its owner. Instead, it uses a `GetGlobalPosition`
    method to fetch the element's position in screen space, as opposed to local space,
    in the render texture of the owner interface. With a bit of basic bounding box
    collision magic, it then determines if a point provided as an argument is within
    the element, based on the size of its current style.

    if this element has an owner and if does not own itself. If it does, the fetched
    position is simply the final result and is returned. Otherwise, the owner's global
    position is obtained through the use of this very method and added to the local
    position. Furthermore, if the element is not a control type, the horizontal and
    vertical scroll values are subtracted from its position in order to honor interface
    scrolling.

    on the type of event we're going to be working with, it's going to need to store
    different data in the `GUI_Event` structure. By using a *union* inside this structure,
    we're going to avoid allocating additional memory, but that comes at a price.
    Unions cannot have members that have member functions, virtual functions, or are
    derivatives of other classes. It is because of this restriction that we are forced
    to define our own `struct` that holds two *floats* and represents a point.

    member of the union is active, as well as names of the element and interface the
    event originated from. If you have a good eye for detail, you may have asked yourself
    by now why we're using `const char*` data types instead of `std::string`. Simplifying
    data types of data members is another sign that this structure will be incorporated
    into a union. Unfortunately, `std::string` falls into the same trap as `sf::Vector2f`

    argument. The same event that was set up before the loop is then slightly modified
    to contain the name of the element and is fired again, indicating that the click
    also affects it. The interface''s state is then changed to `CLICKED`. The result

    if it exceeds the furthest point in the texture, which simply gets overwritten
    on a relevant axis. If an element is found that pokes outside of these boundaries,
    its bottom-right corner position is stored and the control layer is marked for
