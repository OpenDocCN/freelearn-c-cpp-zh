An emerging use of OpenGL is the development of real-time, high-performance data visualization applications in fields ranging from medical imaging, simulation or modeling in architecture and engineering, to cutting-edge mobile/wearable computing. Indeed, data visualization has become increasingly challenging using conventional approaches without graphics hardware acceleration as datasets become larger and more complex, especially with the evolution of big data. From a mobile device to a sophisticated high-performance computing cluster, the OpenGL libraries provide developers with an easy-to-use interface to create stunning visuals in 3D in real time for a wide range of interactive applications.</p><p>This book contains a series of hands-on recipes that are tailored to both beginners who have very little experience with OpenGL and more advanced users who would like to explore state-of-the-art techniques. We begin with a basic introduction to OpenGL in chapters 1 to 3 by demonstrating how to set up the environment in Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux and learning how to render basic 2D datasets with primitives, as well as more complex 3D volumetric datasets interactively. This part requires only OpenGL 2.0 or higher so that even readers with older graphics hardware can experiment with the code. In chapters 4 to 6, we transition to more advanced techniques (which requires OpenGL 3.2 or higher), such as texture mapping for image/video processing, point cloud rendering of depth sensor data from 3D range-sensing cameras, and stereoscopic 3D rendering. Finally, in chapters 7 to 9, we conclude this book by introducing the use of OpenGL ES 3.0 on the increasingly powerful mobile (Android-based) computing platform and the development of highly interactive, augmented reality applications on mobile devices.</p><p>Each recipe in this book gives readers a set of standard functions that can be imported to an existing project and can form the basis for the creation of a diverse array of real-time, interactive data visualization applications. This book also utilizes a set of popular open-source libraries, such as GLFW, GLM, Assimp, and OpenCV, to simplify application development and extend the capabilities of OpenGL by enabling OpenGL context management and 3D model loading, as well as image/video processing using state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started with OpenGL">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started with OpenGL</em></span>, introduces the essential development tools required to create OpenGL-based data visualization applications and provides a step-by-step tutorial on how to set up the environment for our first OpenGL demo application in Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. OpenGL Primitives and 2D Data Visualization">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>OpenGL Primitives and 2D Data Visualization</em></span>, focuses on the use of OpenGL 2.0 primitives, such as points, lines, and triangles, to enable the basic 2D visualization of data, including time series such as an electrocardiogram (ECG).</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Interactive 3D Data Visualization">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Interactive 3D Data Visualization</em></span>, builds upon the fundamental concepts discussed previously and extends the demos to incorporate more sophisticated OpenGL features for 3D rendering.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Rendering 2D Images and Videos with Texture Mapping">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Rendering 2D Images and Videos with Texture Mapping</em></span>, introduces OpenGL techniques to visualize another important class of datasets—those involving images or videos. Such datasets are commonly encountered in many fields, including medical imaging applications.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Rendering of Point Cloud Data for 3D Range-sensing Cameras">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Rendering of Point Cloud Data for 3D Range-sensing Cameras</em></span>, introduces the techniques used to visualize another interesting and emerging class of data—depth information from 3D range sensing cameras.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Rendering Stereoscopic 3D Models using OpenGL">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Rendering Stereoscopic 3D Models using OpenGL</em></span>, demonstrates how to visualize data with stunning stereoscopic 3D technology using OpenGL. OpenGL does not provide any mechanism to load, save, or manipulate 3D models. Thus, to support this, we will integrate a new library named Assimp into our code.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. An Introduction to Real-time Graphics Rendering on a Mobile Platform using OpenGL ES 3.0">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>An Introduction to Real-time Graphics Rendering on a Mobile Platform using OpenGL ES 3.0</em></span>, transitions to an increasingly powerful and ubiquitous computing platform by demonstrating how to set up the Android development environment and create the first Android-based application on the latest mobile devices, from smartphones to tablets, using OpenGL for Embedded Systems (OpenGL ES).</p><p><a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Interactive Real-time Data Visualization on Mobile Devices">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Interactive Real-time Data Visualization on Mobile Devices</em></span>, demonstrates how to visualize data interactively by using built-in motion sensors called Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and the multitouch interface found on mobile devices.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Augmented Reality-based Visualization on Mobile or Wearable Platforms">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Augmented Reality-based Visualization on Mobile or Wearable Platforms</em></span>, introduces the fundamental building blocks required to create your first AR-based application on a commodity Android-based mobile device: OpenCV for computer vision, OpenGL for graphics rendering, as well as Android's sensor framework for interaction.</p></div></div>
