- en: This book takes you through various concepts and each chapter has a project
    that can be performed by you. It covers multiple topics, including sensor data
    acquisition and pushing it to the cloud to control devices over the Internet,
    as well as topics ranging from image processing to both autonomous and manual
    robotics.
