- en: I/O operations are the key operations in the networking infrastructure of any
    distributed application. They are directly involved in the process of data exchange.
    Input operations are used to receive data from remote applications, whereas output
    operations allow sending data to them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we will see several recipes that show how to perform I/O operations
    and other operations related to them. In addition to this, we'll see how to use
    some classes provided by Boost.Asio, which are used in conjunction with I/O operations.
  prefs: []

    in this chapter.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Network programming is all about organizing inter-process communication over
    a computer network. **Communication** in this context implies exchanging data
    between two or more processes. From the perspective of a process that participates
    in such communication, the process performs I/O operations, sending data to and
    receiving it from other participating processes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like any other type of I/O, the network I/O involves using memory buffers, which
    are contiguous blocks of memory allocated in the process's address space used
    to store the data. When doing any sort of input operation (for example, reading
    some data from a file, a pipe, or a remote computer over the network), the data
    arrives at the process and must be stored somewhere in its address space so that
    it is available for further processing. That is, when the buffer comes in handy.
    Before performing an input operation, the buffer is allocated and then used as
    a data destination point during the operation. When the input operation is completed,
    the buffer contains input data, which can be processed by the application. Likewise,
    before performing the output operation, the data must be prepared and put into
    an output buffer, which is then used in the output operation, where it plays the
    role of the data source.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apparently, the buffers are essential ingredients of any application that performs
    any type of I/O, including the network I/O. That's why it is critical for the
    developer who develops a distributed application to know how to allocate and prepare
    the I/O buffers to use them in the I/O operations.

- en: Synchronous and asynchronous I/O operations
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Boost.Asio supports two types of I/O operations: synchronous and asynchronous.
    Synchronous operations block the thread of execution invoking them and unblock
    only when the operation is finished. Hence, the name of this type of operation:
    synchronous.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second type is an asynchronous operation. When an asynchronous operation
    is initiated, it is associated with a callback function or functor, which is invoked
    by the Boost.Asio library when the operation is finished. These types of I/O operations
    provide great flexibility, but may significantly complicate the code. The initiation
    of the operation is simple and doesn't block the thread of execution, which allows
    us to use the thread to run other tasks, while the asynchronous operation is being
    run in the background.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Boost.Asio library is implemented as a framework, which exploits an **inversion
    of control** approach. After one or more asynchronous operations are initiated,
    the application hands over one of its threads of execution to the library, and
    the latter uses this thread to run the event loop and invoke the callbacks provided
    by the application to notify it about the completion of the previously initiated
    asynchronous operation. The results of asynchronous operations are passed to the
    callback as arguments.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to this, we are going to consider such operations as canceling asynchronous
    operations, shutting down, and closing a socket.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ability to cancel a previously initiated asynchronous operation is very
    important. It allows the application to state that the previously initiated operation
    is not relevant anymore, which may save the application's resources (both CPU
    and memory), that otherwise (in case, the operation would continue its execution
    even after it was known that nobody is interested in it anymore) would be unavoidably
    wasted.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Shutting down the socket is useful if there is a need for one part of the distributed
    application to inform the other part that the whole message has been sent, when
    the application layer protocol does not provide us with other means to indicate
    the message boundary.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As with any other operating system resource, a socket should be returned back
    to the operating system when it is not needed anymore by the application. A closing
    operation allows us to do so.

- en: Using fixed length I/O buffers
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fixed length I/O buffers are usually used with I/O operations and play the role
    of either a data source or destination when the size of the message to be sent
    or received is known. For example, this can be a constant array of chars allocated
    on a stack, which contain a string that represents the request to be sent to the
    server. Or, this can be a writable buffer allocated in the free memory, which
    is used as a data destination point, when reading data from a socket.
  prefs: []

    can be used with Boost.Asio I/O operations.

    `asio::mutable_buffer` or `asio::const_buffer`. Both these classes represent a
    contiguous block of memory that is specified by the address of the first byte
    of the block and its size in bytes. As the names of these classes suggest, `asio::mutable_buffer`
    represents a writable buffer, whereas `asio::const_buffer` represents a read-only

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although in most use cases, a single buffer is involved in a single I/O operation,
    in some specific circumstances (for example, in a memory-constrained environment),
    a developer may want to use a composite buffer that comprises multiple smaller
    simple buffers distributed over the process's address space. Boost.Asio I/O functions
    and methods are designed to work with composite buffers that are represented as
    a collection of buffers that fulfill the requirements of either the `MutableBufferSequence`
    or `ConstBufferSequence` concept.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance, an object of the `std::vector<asio::mutable_buffer>` class satisfies
    the requirements of the `MutableBufferSequence` concept, and therefore, it can
    be used to represent a composite buffer in I/O-related functions and methods.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, now we know that if we have a buffer that is represented as an object of
    the `asio::mutable_buffer` or `asio::const_buffer` class, we still can't use it
    with I/O-related functions or methods provided by Boost.Asio. The buffer must
    be represented as an object, satisfying the requirements of either the `MutableBufferSequence`
    or `ConstBufferSequence` concept, respectively. To do this, we for example could
    create a collection of buffer objects consisting of a single buffer by instantiating
    an object of the `std::vector<asio::mutable_buffer>` class and placing our buffer
    object into it. Now that the buffer is part of the collection, satisfying the
    `MutableBufferSequence` requirements can be used in I/O operations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, although this method is fine to create composite buffers consisting
    of two or more simple buffers, it looks overly complex when it comes to such simple
    tasks as representing a single simple buffer so that it can be used with Boost.Asio
    I/O functions or methods. Fortunately, Boost.Asio provides us with a way to simplify
    the usage of single buffers with I/O-related functions and methods.

    representations of a buffer and return an object of either the `asio::mutable_buffers_1`
    or `asio::const_buffers_1` classes. If the buffer argument passed to the `asio::buffer()`
    function is a read-only type, the function returns an object of the `asio::const_buffers_1`
    class; otherwise, an object of the `asio::mutable_buffers_1` class is returned.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `asio::mutable_buffers_1` and `asio::const_buffers_1` classes are *adapters*
    of the `asio::mutable_buffer` and `asio::const_buffer` classes, respectively.
    They provide an interface and behavior that satisfy the requirements of the `MutableBufferSequence`
    and `ConstBufferSequence` concepts, which allows us to pass these adapters as
    arguments to Boost.Asio I/O functions and methods.

    `MutableBufferSequence` concept. Contrary to `ConstBufferSequence`, this concept
    represents the collection of *mutable* buffers, that is, those that can be written
    to. Here, we use the `buffer()` function, which helps us create the required representation

- en: The `main()`application entry point function is quite simple. It allocates a
    socket, opens, and synchronously connects it to a remote application. Then, the
    `writeToSocket()` function is called and the socket object is passed to it as
    an argument. In addition to this, the `main()`function contains a `try-catch`
    block intended to catch and handle exceptions that may be thrown by Boost.Asio
    methods and functions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The interesting part in the sample is the `writeToSocket()`function that performs
    synchronous writing to the socket. It accepts a reference to the socket object
    as an argument. Its precondition is that the socket passed to it is already connected;
    otherwise, the function fails.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    we use an ASCII string as data that is to be written to the socket, and, therefore,
    we allocate an object of the `std::string` class and assign it a value of `Hello`,
    which we will use as a dummy message that will be written to the socket.

    Except for the degenerate case when the buffer is empty (that is, the `buf.length()`

    and the `write_some()` method is called at least once. Let''s take a closer look

    the value of the `total_bytes_written` variable is increased by the value returned
    by the `write_some()` method, which is equal to the number of bytes written during

    It begins with allocating an instance of the `Session` data structure in the free
    memory. Then, it allocates and fills the buffer with the data to be written to
    the socket. After this, a pointer to the socket object and the buffer are stored
    in the `Session` object. Because the socket's `async_write_some()` method may
    not write all the data to the socket in one go, we may need to initiate another
    asynchronous write operation in a callback function. That's why we need the `Session`
    object and we allocate it in the free memory and not on the stack; it must *live*
    until the callback function is called.

    to the first and second arguments of the `async_read_some()` method of a TCP socket
    object described in the previous sample. These arguments are buffers used as data
    destination points and functions or objects that represent a callback, which will
    be called when the operation is completed.
  prefs: []

    operation, that reads *some* amount of data from the socket to the buffer, the
    `asio::async_read()` function initiates the operation that reads the data from
    the socket until the buffer passed to it as an argument is full. In this case,
    the callback is called when the amount of data read is equal to the size of the
    provided buffer or when an error occurs. This simplifies reading from the socket
    and makes the code shorter and cleaner.

    of an operation. Therefore, Boost.Asio requires developers to explicitly notify
    that they want to enable the asynchronous operation canceling functionality despite
    of the known issues, when targeting the application in versions of Windows in
    question. To do this, the `BOOST_ASIO_ENABLE_CANCELIO` macro must be defined before
    Boost.Asio headers are included. Otherwise, if this macro is not defined, while

    a TCP socket according to step 2 of the algorithm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, the asynchronous connection operation is initiated on the socket. The
    callback provided to the method is implemented as a lambda function. This corresponds
    to steps 3 and 4 of the algorithm. Note how the fact that the operation was canceled
    is determined in the callback function. When an asynchronous operation is canceled,
    the callback is invoked and its argument that specifies the error code contains
    an OS dependent error code defined in Boost.Asio as `asio::error::operation_aborted`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, we spawn a thread named `worker_thread`, which will be used to run the
    Boost.Asio event loop. In the context of this thread, the callback function will
    be invoked by the library. The entry point function of the `worker_thread` thread
    is quite simple. It contains a `try-catch` block and a call to the `asio::io_service`
    object's `run()` method. This corresponds to step 5 of the algorithm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After the worker thread is spawned, the main thread is put to sleep for 2 seconds.
    This is to allow the connection operation to progress a bit and emulate what could
    be a delay between the two commands issued by the user in the real application;
    for example, a web browser.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: According to the last step 6 of the algorithm, we call the socket object's `cancel()`
    method to cancel the initiated connection operation. At this point, if the operation
    has not yet finished, it will be canceled and the corresponding callback will
    be invoked with an argument that specifies the error code containing the `asio::error::operation_aborted`
    value to notify that the operation was canceled. However, if the operation has
    already finished, calling the `cancel()` method has no effect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the callback function returns, the worker thread exits the event loop because
    there are no more outstanding asynchronous operations to be executed. As a result,
    the thread exits its entry point function. This leads to the main thread running
    to its completion as well. Eventually, the application exits.
