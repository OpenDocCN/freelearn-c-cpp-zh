One thing people usually want to do in home automation is follow the energy consumption of their electrical devices and turn them on or off remotely, for example, using their smartphones or tablets.</p><p>Of course, many <a id="id38" class="indexterm"/>devices that currently exist can measure energy consumption on a power socket as well as being able to switch the device that is connected to this socket on and off. These devices are now very compact and easy to connect to a local Wi-Fi network, and these can also communicate with mobile devices using Bluetooth. Many large electronics manufacturers have developed their own solutions, and everyone can now buy these products and install them in their homes.</p><p>In this project, we are going to build our own do-it-yourself version of such a device and build a power switch and energy meter in order to turn an electrical device on and off as well as to follow its energy consumption.</p><p>The following are the main highlights of this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Connecting a relay to one of the Arduino Yún digital outputs and using the Yún REST API to command this relay from a web browser</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using an analog current sensor to get a measurement of the instant current consumption from the device that is connected to the relay, and calculate the instant power consumption from this measurement</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Sending this data to a Google Docs spreadsheet so that it can be accessed remotely from any web browser or from the Google Docs mobile app, and calculating the energy consumption and some other useful data such as the total energy cost of the device connected to your project</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating a simple web interface to control the lamp using your computer or any smartphone or tablet</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="The required hardware and software components"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec13"/>The required hardware and software components</h1></div></div></div><p>The first <a id="id39" class="indexterm"/>part of this project is to get the required parts that we<a id="id40" class="indexterm"/> are going to use for our energy consumption meter and power switch project. Apart from the Arduino Yún board, which will be the "brain" of the project, you will need to <a id="id41" class="indexterm"/>have two main parts ready on your desk when building the project. These parts are the relay module, which we will use to switch the lamp on and off, and the analog current sensor, which is used to measure the power and later the energy consumption of the lamp.</p><p>A relay<a id="id42" class="indexterm"/> is basically an electromagnetic switch used in projects where we need to switch a really large voltage (110V or 230V) using a small voltage as the command signal (5V from the Arduino board). For the relay, we used a basic 5V relay module from Polulu, which can switch up to 10A and is more than enough for many home appliances such as lamps. (In Europe, with 230V, you can connect up to 2300W.) The module itself is simply a relay mounted on a printed circuit board along with the required components that are necessary to operate the relay and some large headers and traces to carry up to 10A if necessary. It uses an Omron G5LE-14-DC5 relay. The following image is the relay used:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8007OS_02_01.jpg" alt="The required hardware and software components"/></div><p>Of course, you can use any equivalent relay module. Just make sure that it can be switched on/off using a digital 5V signal like we have on the Arduino Yún board and that it can switch at least 5A, just to be safe for this project. The lamp we are using in this project only uses around 130 mA, but you may want to connect larger devices to your project later. If you want to build your own module from a relay, you simply need to add a diode in series with the relay to protect your Arduino board when the relay is switching.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip03"/>Tip</h3><p>Do not attempt to use a relay alone on a breadboard along with the required components to operate it. The small tracks on the breadboard cannot support high currents and voltages and you will run into serious safety issues if you do so, such as the potential meltdown of these tracks, which can lead to fire. So, use a dedicated relay module for this project.</p></div></div><p>Then, you <a id="id43" class="indexterm"/>need a current sensor to get the instant current consumption of the lamp. We used a module from ITead Studio, which is basically a breakout board for the ACS712 sensor. A breakout board<a id="id44" class="indexterm"/> is simply a board that is composed of a printed circuit board, the chip itself, and all the components required to make the chip work, such as resistors and capacitors. This sensor delivers an analog signal as an output, which is proportional to the measured current. This signal can then easily be converted to the corresponding current on the Arduino Yún board. We will acquire this analog signal using one of the integrated analog-digital converters of the Yún board. Note that there are also noninvasive current sensors that you can simply clip around the cable you want to measure, but these are usually bigger and don't integrate well with Arduino projects. The following is an image of the sensor used for this project:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8007OS_02_02.jpg" alt="The required hardware and software components"/></div><p>Just as for the relay module, you can use any equivalent current sensor for this project. The important <a id="id45" class="indexterm"/>parameters to be considered are the maximum current that can flow through the sensor (5A for the one we used) and the sensitivity of the sensor (185 mV/A for the one we used). If these two parameters are similar to the sensor I used in this project, or if they are better, you can use the sensor.</p><p>You also need to connect the lamp to the project in some way. Of course, one way would be to directly cut the power cable of the lamp and connect the lamp directly to our project, but I don't like this option because it's quite messy. As I mentioned in the introduction of this project, I don't want you to touch your lamp or other device in any way, and I want you to be able to connect your lamp again to the power socket in the wall if you want to.</p><p>I used two power cables so that I can connect my project to the wall socket on one side and connect the lamp to the project on the other side, just as I would do with a commercial device bought off the shelf.</p><p>The following is what I used for the power cable where I will plug the lamp:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8007OS_02_03.jpg" alt="The required hardware and software components"/></div><p>The following <a id="id46" class="indexterm"/>is the power cable I will use to connect the project to the wall plug:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8007OS_02_04.jpg" alt="The required hardware and software components"/></div><p>Note that some power plugs have three cables (the additional cable being for the ground connection), but as we will be working with small loads such as lamps, the third cable is not necessary for this project.</p><p>On the hardware <a id="id47" class="indexterm"/>side, I also used a small piece of a breadboard to make the power connections of the relay and the current sensor (because the Arduino Yún board only has one 5V pin). But of course, you can use a full-size breadboard to make these connections.</p><p>On the software side, you will need the latest beta version of the Arduino IDE, which is the only one that supports the Arduino Yún board (I used Version 1.5.5 while doing this project).</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Connecting the components to the Y&#xFA;n board"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec14"/>Connecting the components to the Yún board</h1></div></div></div><p>We are now<a id="id48" class="indexterm"/> going to connect the relay module and the current sensor to the Arduino Yún board, connect the power cable that will power up<a id="id49" class="indexterm"/> the lamp, and finally connect everything to the power socket in the wall. This part is slightly more difficult than the hardware connections in <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Building a Weather Station Connected to the Cloud">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Building a Weather Station Connected to the Cloud</em></span>, as it involves more steps and uses a higher voltage that requires you to take some precautions. So, please be careful and follow all the steps.</p><p>The first step is to put the Arduino Yún board, the relay module, and the current sensor board close to each other, as shown in the following image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8007OS_02_05.jpg" alt="Connecting the components to the Yún board"/></div><p>Then, we are going to connect the power supply of the relay module and the current sensor. As I <a id="id50" class="indexterm"/>said earlier in this chapter, the Arduino Yún board <a id="id51" class="indexterm"/>only has one 5V pin. This is why I connected the 5V pins of the two modules to a small piece of a breadboard first and then connected this breadboard to the Arduino 5V pin, as shown in the following image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8007OS_02_06.jpg" alt="Connecting the components to the Yún board"/></div><p>After this, we have to connect the ground pins of the two modules to the ground pin on the Arduino Yún board as shown in the following image. The Arduino Yún board has two ground pins on the board, so you don't have to use the breadboard for this.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8007OS_02_07.jpg" alt="Connecting the components to the Yún board"/></div><p>To finish with the connection of the two modules, we need to connect their respective signal pins to <a id="id52" class="indexterm"/>the Arduino board. The relay will be controlled via pin number 8 of the Arduino Yún board, so connect the signal pin of the relay module to pin number 8 of the Yún board.</p><p>The current sensor <a id="id53" class="indexterm"/>has an analog output, so it has to be connected to one analog input on the Arduino board in order to acquire the signal using one of the Yún integrated analog-to-digital converters. This converter will acquire the analog signal that comes from the sensor and transform it into digital values that range from 0 to 1023 (which correspond to a 10-bit precision). Connect the output pin of the current sensor module to pin number A0 of the Arduino Yún board, as shown in the following image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8007OS_02_08.jpg" alt="Connecting the components to the Yún board"/></div><p>That's basically all for the low-power part. Now, we will focus on connecting the project to the two <a id="id54" class="indexterm"/>power <a id="id55" class="indexterm"/>supply cables so that we can plug the project into the wall plug and plug the lamp to the project. We will start by connecting the cable that will go to the wall, as shown in the following image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8007OS_02_09.jpg" alt="Connecting the components to the Yún board"/></div><p>Finally, connect <a id="id56" class="indexterm"/>the female power plug that we will connect the lamp to, as shown in the following image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8007OS_02_10.jpg" alt="Connecting the components to the Yún board"/></div><p>Finally, it's time to power up everything. You can plug your Arduino Yún board in to your computer via a USB cable (if you want to upload sketches directly and want space for your computer to<a id="id57" class="indexterm"/> be around the project) or via a wall power socket to a USB adapter (if you plan to upload the sketches via Wi-Fi and leave the project to work on its own).</p><p>Then, plug the <a id="id58" class="indexterm"/>lamp or the device that you want to control in to the female power plug of the project. To finish, connect the male power plug to the power socket in the wall. Be careful while performing this step: make sure that no electrical conductors are exposed, all screw terminals are correctly screwed and are holding the cables firmly, and no bare electrical conductors touch each other.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Testing your hardware connections"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec15"/>Testing your hardware connections</h1></div></div></div><p>Now<a id="id59" class="indexterm"/> that the connections are done, we are going to test everything before we start sending energy consumption data to the cloud and building the interface to control the relay. We are going to test the different modules as if the project was already in operation. For the entire duration of the tests, we are going to connect the project to the power socket in the wall and to the lamp that we want to control. This way, we will ensure that all the hardware connections are correct before moving further.</p><p>The relay, for example, will be controlled via Wi-Fi using the Arduino Yún REST API, just as it will be in the final version of the project. Basically, we will just send a command from your web browser to directly set the value of the pin to which the relay is connected. Later in the project, we will make this call via a graphical user interface instead of actually typing the command in a browser.</p><p>For the current sensor, we are going to simply read the value measured on the analog pin A0 using the analog-to-digital converter of the Yún, convert it to a usable current, and then calculate the value of the effective current and the effective power as we already know the value of the effective voltage (110V or 230V depending on where you live).</p><p>Let's first have a look at the Arduino code. It starts by importing the right libraries, as shown in the following code. We need the <code class="literal">Bridge</code> library so that we can use the functions from the onboard Linux machine of the Yún, and the <code class="literal">YunServer</code> and <code class="literal">YunClient</code> libraries so that we can receive external commands using the REST API. REST APIs are usually only used by web developers, but Arduino actually proposes a sketch that implements such an API for the Arduino Yún. This sketch is directly accessible in the library that comes with the Arduino Yún, and in this project, I used a modified version of this reference sketch.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">#include &lt;Bridge.h&gt;
#include &lt;YunServer.h&gt;
#include &lt;YunClient.h&gt;</pre></div><p>To use the REST API of the Yún, we need to create a <code class="literal">YunServer</code> instance, as shown in the following line of code. This server will run continuously and wait for incoming commands.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">YunServer server;</pre></div><p>We also need <a id="id60" class="indexterm"/>to define the pins that our sensors are connected to, as shown in the following lines of code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">#define CURRENT_SENSOR A0
#define RELAY_PIN 8</pre></div><p>One important part of the sketch is to declare the value of the effective voltage, which will be used later to calculate the effective power of the device, as shown in the following line of code. This value depends on where you are located (for example, <code class="literal">230</code> for Europe, and <code class="literal">110</code> for the USA):</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">float effective_voltage = 230;</pre></div><p>In the <code class="literal">setup()</code> part, we need to start the bridge between the Arduino microcontroller and the Linux machine as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">Bridge.begin();</pre></div><p>We also need to start the web server as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">server.listenOnLocalhost();
server.begin();</pre></div><p>Then, the last and most important part of the <code class="literal">setup()</code> function<a id="id61" class="indexterm"/> is to calibrate the sensor in order to determine which value is returned when the current is null. This is done by the following line of code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">zero_sensor = getSensorValue();</pre></div><p>Let's dive into this function. We could simply get one measurement from the current sensor but that would be a bad idea. Indeed, the value that you get from the sensor varies slightly over time, around an average that we actually want to measure. This is typical behavior when using analog sensors that have important sensitivities such as the one we are using here. This is why the function basically samples and averages the signal over several measurements with the following lines of code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">for (int i = 0; i &lt; nb_measurements; i++) {
  sensorValue = analogRead(CURRENT_SENSOR);
  avgSensor = avgSensor + float(sensorValue);
}  
avgSensor = avgSensor/float(nb_measurements);</pre></div><p>After these measurements, we return the average as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">return avgSensor;</pre></div><p>This way, we are sure to get a stable value of the sensor reading every time. This value is then used throughout the whole sketch as a reference value for the current sensor readings. For<a id="id62" class="indexterm"/> example, if the measured value is equal to this reference, we will know that the current in the lamp is null. The actual sensor reading during the operation of the project uses the same function, so we always get a stable measurement.</p><p>Now, comes the <code class="literal">loop()</code> part of the sketch. It actually consists of two parts: in the first part, we will receive incoming connections on the Yún web server that we started earlier, and in the second part, we will print out the measurements that come from the current sensor.</p><p>For the web server part, we can listen for connections as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">YunClient client = server.accept();</pre></div><p>If a client is detected, we process the request with the following code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">if (client) {
  // Process request
  process(client);

  // Close connection and free resources.
  client.stop();
}</pre></div><p>I won't detail the <code class="literal">Process</code> function as it is the same as in the <code class="literal">Bridge</code> example for the Arduino Yún that we used earlier (this is available as an example in the Yún <code class="literal">Bridge</code> library). To know more about the Yún REST API, you can visit the official Arduino documentation on the Arduino website at <a class="ulink" href="http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoYun">http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoYun</a>.</p><p>Now, we will write the part of the sketch that is responsible for the current measurements. It starts when you get a stable measurement, just as we did earlier for the null current as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">float sensor_value = getSensorValue();</pre></div><p>I won't get into the details of this function as it is the same as which we used to get the value for the null current. We can now do some calculations on this measured value. First, we need to convert it to a usable current value as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">amplitude_current=(float)(sensor_value-zero_sensor)/1024*5/185*1000000;</pre></div><p>This is the amplitude of the current, which is a sinusoidal current. This formula can be found in the datasheet of the sensor as well as on the ITead Studio website. Because we know this information about the current, to get the effective current, we simply need to divide it by the square root of two as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">effective_value=amplitude_current/1.414;</pre></div><p>To get the effective power, we then need to transform this current in amperes by dividing the value by 1000 and multiplying it with the effective voltage. I also added an absolute value operator so that the power is always positive, even when you connect the current sensor to measure negative currents, as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">abs(effective_value*effective_voltage/1000);</pre></div><p>The sketch<a id="id63" class="indexterm"/> ends by printing all these values on the Serial monitor and repeats itself every 50 milliseconds. The complete sketch for this part is available on the GitHub repository of the book at <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/openhomeautomation/geeky-projects-yun/tree/master/chapter2/sensors_test">https://github.com/openhomeautomation/geeky-projects-yun/tree/master/chapter2/sensors_test</a>.</p><p>Now you can upload the sketch to the Arduino board. Remember that at this point, the Arduino Yún board should be powered by either your computer or a USB power adapter, the lamp should be plugged to the project in the female power cord, and the project itself should be plugged into the wall socket.</p><p>The relay is quite easy to test; you just need to go to your web browser and type in the right command. The REST API of the Yún works by typing the name of your Arduino Yún board followed by <code class="literal">.local</code> (in my case, I named it <code class="literal">myarduinoyun</code>). Then, if it is followed by <code class="literal">arduino/</code>, you can directly use commands to change the value of the Arduino pins. For example, to change the value of the relay pin to 1, you need to add <code class="literal">digital/8/1</code>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8007OS_02_11.jpg" alt="Testing your hardware connections"/></div><p>The preceding command means that you are calling the command <code class="literal">digitalWrite(8,HIGH)</code> using the REST API. You should instantly hear the relay switch and see the light turn on. Try again by adding a <code class="literal">0</code> after the command instead of a <code class="literal">1</code>; the relay should switch again and turn the light off. Don't worry, as later in the project, we'll build a nice graphical interface so that you don't have to write this command every time.</p><p>Now we are going to check the measurements coming from the current sensor. Make sure that the lamp is off, reset the Arduino microcontroller to be sure that the sketch starts from the beginning again, and then open the Serial monitor. To do this, the Arduino Yún board has to be connected to your computer via the USB cable. The first thing you should see is the measurement for a null current as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>Sensor value: 493.05</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Then, the sketch <a id="id64" class="indexterm"/>continuously displays the value of the sensor reading, current amplitude, effective current, and effective power. Even if the current is null, remember that we average the sensor readings over several measurements, so there can be minor fluctuations in the value, as shown in the following code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>Sensor value: 492.87</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>Current amplitude (in mA): </strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>4.5</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>Current effective value (in mA)</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>3.2</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>Effective power (in W): </strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>0.7</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>If you then turn the lamp on using the REST call in your browser, you should instantly see a change in the current and power readings as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>Sensor value: 486.52</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>Current amplitude (in mA): </strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>-163.1</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>Current effective value (in mA)</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>-115.4</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>Effective power (in W): </strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>26.5</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>If you can see these values and your relay is responding to the REST calls in your browser, it means that your hardware is working correctly and you can proceed to the next step. If it doesn't work, the first step is to check the different connections of the current sensor and relay module. Also check that you have selected the correct Serial speed in the Serial monitor so that it matches the speed defined in the sketch.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Sending data to Google Docs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec16"/>Sending data to Google Docs</h1></div></div></div><p>The first step<a id="id65" class="indexterm"/> is to set up a Google Docs spreadsheet for the project. Create a new sheet, give it a name (I named mine <code class="literal">Power</code> for this project, but you can name it as you wish), and set a title for the columns that we are going to use: <span class="strong"><strong>Time</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Interval</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Power</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Energy</strong></span> (that will be calculated from the first two columns), as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8007OS_02_12.jpg" alt="Sending data to Google Docs"/></div><p>We can also calculate<a id="id66" class="indexterm"/> the value of the energy using the other measurements. From theory, we know that over a given period of time, energy is power multiplied by time; that is, <span class="emphasis"><em>Energy = Power * Time</em></span>.</p><p>However, in our case, power is calculated at regular intervals, and we want to estimate the energy consumption for each of these intervals. In mathematical terms, this means we need to calculate the integral of power as a function of time.</p><p>We don't have<a id="id67" class="indexterm"/> the exact function between time and power as we sample this function at regular time intervals, but we can estimate this integral using a method called the trapezoidal rule. It means that we basically estimate the integral of the function, which is the area below the power curve, by a trapeze. The energy in the <code class="literal">C2</code> cell in the spreadsheet is then given by the formula:</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Energy= (PowerMeasurement + NextPowerMeasurement)*TimeInverval/2</em></span>.</p><p>Concretely, in Google Docs, you will need the formula, <span class="emphasis"><em>D2 = (B2 + B3)*C2/2</em></span>.</p><p>The Arduino Yún board will give you the power measurement, and the time interval is given by the value we set in the sketch. However, the time between two measurements can vary from measurement to measurement. This is due to the delay introduced by the network. To solve this issue, we will transmit the exact value along with the power measurement to get a much better estimate of the energy consumption.</p><p>Then, it's time to build the sketch that we will use for the project. The goal of this sketch is basically to wait for commands that come from the network, to switch the relay on or off, and to send data to the Google Docs spreadsheet at regular intervals to keep track of the energy consumption.</p><p>We will build the sketch on top of the sketch we built earlier so I will explain which components need to be added. First, you need to include your Temboo credentials using the following line of code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">#include "TembooAccount.h"</pre></div><p>Since we can't continuously measure the power consumption data (the data transmitted would be huge, and we will quickly exceed our monthly access limit for Temboo!), like in the test sketch, we need to measure it at given intervals only. However, at the same time, we need to continuously check whether a command is received from the outside to switch the state of the relay. This is done by setting the correct timings first, as shown in the following code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">int server_poll_time = 50;
int power_measurement_delay = 10000;
int power_measurement_cycles_max = power_measurement_delay/server_poll_time;</pre></div><p>The server poll time will be the interval at which we check the incoming connections. The power measurement delay, as you can guess, is the delay at which the power is measured.</p><p>However, <a id="id68" class="indexterm"/>we can't use a simple delay function for this as it will put the entire sketch on hold. What we are going to do instead is to count the number of cycles of the main loop and then trigger a measurement when the right amount of cycles have been reached using a simple <code class="literal">if</code> statement. The right amount of cycles is given by the power measurement <code class="literal">cycles_max</code> variable.</p><p>You also need to insert your Google Docs credentials using the following lines of code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">const String GOOGLE_USERNAME = "yourGoogleUsername";
const String GOOGLE_PASSWORD = "yourGooglePass";
const String SPREADSHEET_TITLE = "Power";</pre></div><p>In the <code class="literal">setup()</code> function, you need to start a date process that will keep a track of the measurement date. We want to keep a track of the measurement over several days, so we will transmit the date of the day as well as the time, as shown in the following code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">time = millis();
if (!date.running())  {
  date.begin("date");
  date.addParameter("+%D-%T");
  date.run();
}</pre></div><p>In the <code class="literal">loop()</code> function<a id="id69" class="indexterm"/> of the sketch, we check whether it's time to perform a measurement from the current sensor, as shown in the following line of code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">if (power_measurement_cycles &gt; power_measurement_cycles_max)</pre></div><p>If that's the case, we measure the sensor value, as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">float sensor_value = getSensorValue();</pre></div><p>We also get the exact measurement interval that we will transmit along with the measured power to get a correct estimate of the energy consumption, as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">measurements_interval = millis() - last_measurement;
last_measurement = millis();</pre></div><p>We then calculate the effective power from the data we already have. The amplitude of the current<a id="id70" class="indexterm"/> is obtained from the sensor measurements as shown earlier. Then we can get the effective value of the current by dividing this amplitude by the square root of 2. Finally, as we know the effective voltage and that power is current multiplied by voltage, we can calculate the effective power as well, as shown in the following code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">// Convert to current
amplitude_current=(float)(sensor_value-zero_sensor)/1024*5/185*1000000;
effective_value=amplitude_current/1.414;

// Calculate power
   float effective_power = abs(effective_value * effective_voltage/1000);</pre></div><p>After this, we send the data with the time interval to Google Docs and reset the counter for power measurements, as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">runAppendRow(measurements_interval,effective_power);
power_measurement_cycles = 0;</pre></div><p>The function to send data to Google Docs is nearly the same as the one we saw in <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Building a Weather Station Connected to the Cloud">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Building a Weather Station Connected to the Cloud</em></span>. Let's quickly go into the details of this function. It starts by declaring the type of Temboo library we want to use, as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">TembooChoreo AppendRowChoreo;</pre></div><p>Start with the following line of code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">AppendRowChoreo.begin();</pre></div><p>We then need to set the data that concerns your Google account, for example, the username, as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">AppendRowChoreo.addInput("Username", GOOGLE_USERNAME);</pre></div><p>The actual formatting of the data is done with the following line of code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">data = data + timeString + "," + String(interval) + "," + String(effectiveValue);</pre></div><p>Here, <code class="literal">interval</code> is the time interval between two measurements, and <code class="literal">effectiveValue</code> is the value of the measured power that we want to log on to Google Docs. The Choreo is then executed with the following line of code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">AppendRowChoreo.run();</pre></div><p>Finally, we do this after every 50 milliseconds and get an increment to the power measurement counter each time, as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">delay(server_poll_time);
power_measurement_cycles++; </pre></div><p>The complete code for this section is available at <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/openhomeautomation/geeky-projects-yun/tree/master/chapter2/energy_log">https://github.com/openhomeautomation/geeky-projects-yun/tree/master/chapter2/energy_log</a>.</p><p>The code for<a id="id71" class="indexterm"/> this part is complete. You can now upload the sketch and after that, open the Google Docs spreadsheet and then just wait until the first measurement arrives. The following screenshot shows the first measurement I got:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8007OS_02_13.jpg" alt="Sending data to Google Docs"/></div><p>After a few moments, I got several measurements logged on my Google Docs spreadsheet. I also played a bit with the lamp control by switching it on and off so that we can actually see changes in the measured data. The following screenshot shows the first few measurements:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8007OS_02_14.jpg" alt="Sending data to Google Docs"/></div><p>It's good to have some data logged in the spreadsheet, but it is even better to display this data in a graph. I used the built-in plotting capabilities of Google Docs to plot the power consumption over time on a graph, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8007OS_02_15.jpg" alt="Sending data to Google Docs"/></div><p>Using the same<a id="id72" class="indexterm"/> kind of graph, you can also plot the calculated energy consumption data over time, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8007OS_02_16.jpg" alt="Sending data to Google Docs"/></div><p>From the data you get in this Google Docs spreadsheet, it is also quite easy to get other interesting data. You can, for example, estimate the total energy consumption over time and the price that it will cost you. The first step is to calculate the sum of the energy consumption column using the integrated sum functionality of Google Docs.</p><p>Then, you have the energy consumption in Joules, but that's not what the electricity company usually charges you for. Instead, they use kWh, which is basically the Joule value divided by 3,600,000. The last thing we need is the price of a single kWh. Of course, this will<a id="id73" class="indexterm"/> depend on the country you're living in, but at the time of writing this book, the price in the USA was approximately $0.16 per kWh. To get the total price, you then just need to multiply the total energy consumption in kWh with the price per kWh.</p><p>This is the result with the data I recorded. Of course, as I only took a short sample of data, it cost me nearly nothing in the end, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8007OS_02_17.jpg" alt="Sending data to Google Docs"/></div><p>You can also estimate the on/off time of the device you are measuring. For this purpose, I simply added an additional column next to <code class="literal">Energy</code> named <code class="literal">On/Off</code>. I simply used the formula <code class="literal">=IF(C2&lt;2;0;1)</code>.</p><p>It means that if the power is less than 2W, we count it as an off state; otherwise, we count it as an on state. I didn't set the condition to 0W to count it as an off state because of the small fluctuations over time from the current sensor. Then, when you have this data about the different on/off states, it's quite simple to count the number of occurrences of each state, for example, on states, using <code class="literal">=COUNTIF(E:E,"1")</code>.</p><p>I applied these formulas in my Google Docs spreadsheet, and the following screenshot is the result with the sample data I recorded:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8007OS_02_18.jpg" alt="Sending data to Google Docs"/></div><p>It is also very convenient to represent this data in a graph. For this, I used a pie chart, which I believe is the most adaptable graph for this kind of data. The following screenshot is what I got with my measurements:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8007OS_02_19.jpg" alt="Sending data to Google Docs"/></div><p>With the preceding<a id="id74" class="indexterm"/> kind of chart, you can compare the usage of a given lamp from day to day, for example, to know whether you have left the lights on when you are not there.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Building an interface to switch the lights on/off remotely"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec17"/>Building an interface to switch the lights on/off remotely</h1></div></div></div><p>Now that our<a id="id75" class="indexterm"/> project automatically logs data concerning the energy consumption on Google Docs, it's time to go back to the relay control. For now, we tested the relay by going into a web browser and typing the correct REST function with the name of the pin we want to change.</p><p>However, that's not very convenient. You don't want to type something in your web browser every time you want to turn a light on in your home. What we would like to have instead is a nice graphical interface with buttons that can be pressed to turn a light on or off. It would be even better if this interface could be accessed not only from a web browser on your computer but also from any smartphone or tablet in your home. That's exactly what we are going to build now.</p><p>We need several components to do so, and we will mix several programming languages to build the best graphical interface possible. We will use HTML for the main page that will host the on/off button, JavaScript to handle the actions of this button, and PHP to transmit the correct command to the Arduino server. We are also going to use some CSS to make the interface look much better and automatically adapt itself to the device you are using, such as a smartphone.</p><p>First, let's deal <a id="id76" class="indexterm"/>with the HTML code. We need to import the jQuery library and the file that will contain all the JavaScript code, as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;script src="jquery-2.0.3.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre></div><p>Also, import the CSS style file, as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"&gt;</pre></div><p>The core of this HTML file is to create two buttons; one button to switch the relay on and the other to switch it off again. The following, for example, is the code for the <span class="strong"><strong>On</strong></span> button:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;input type="button" id="on" class="commandButton" value="On" onClick="relayOn()"/&gt;</pre></div><p>Now, if you were to actually take this file as it is, it would look really bad as some default styles would be applied to the buttons. That's why we attached a CSS file to make the interface look a bit better. For example, I decided to center align the main form that contains the two buttons, as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">#relay {
  text-align: center;
}</pre></div><p>I also gave some style to the buttons themselves, such as an orange background; I made them bigger and also put a nice black border around them, as shown in the following code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">.commandButton {
  background-color: orange;
  border: 1px solid black; 
  font-size: 40px;
  cursor: pointer;
  border-radius: 10px;
  width: 300px;
  height: 100px;
}</pre></div><p>Now the interface looks much better on your computer. But what if somebody opens it from a smartphone? It would not be adapted at all to the tiny screen of a smartphone. To automatically make the interface adapt to the device you are using, we will use a property from CSS3 called media queries. This feature of CSS3 can, for example, detect whether a smaller screen size is used to access the page. Then, when you have this information, you can use it to modify the style of the different elements accordingly, for example, we may want to make our buttons appear differently on the page.</p><p>In our case, <a id="id77" class="indexterm"/>we want to make the buttons take all the space available on the smaller screen. We also want to double the height of each button as well as double the font size so that they can be really readable on a small screen like on a smartphone. All of this is done by the following piece of code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">@media screen and (max-device-width: 400px) {
  .commandButton {
    width: 100%;
    height: 200px;
    border: 2px solid black; 
    font-size: 80px;
    margin-bottom: 50px;
       text-align: center;
       background-color: orange;
       }
}</pre></div><p>The JavaScript file simply makes the interface between the GUI we just designed and the PHP file that will actually connect to the Arduino Yún board. The following, for example, is the code called by one button:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">function relayOn(){
  $.get( "update_state.php", { command: "1"} );
}</pre></div><p>The <code class="literal">command</code> variable simply contains the state of the relay that we want to send to the Arduino Yún board and will set the value of the pin that the relay is connected to.</p><p>Now let's see the PHP file. The first line of the code gets the command variable from the JavaScript and builds the command that will be sent to the Yún, as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">$service_url = 'http://myarduinoyun.local/arduino/digital/8/' . $_GET["command"];</pre></div><p>To actually send the command, we are going to use a PHP function named <code class="literal">curl</code> that we will use to call the REST API of the Yún. We first have to initialize this function with the URL we built earlier, as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">$curl = curl_init($service_url);</pre></div><p>Finally, we actually execute this command with the following code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE, CURL_IPRESOLVE_V4 ); 
$curl_response = curl_exec($curl);
curl_close($curl);</pre></div><p>The option with <code class="literal">set</code> in the first line of code is used simply to speed up access to the Arduino board. <a id="id78" class="indexterm"/>Before testing the interface, make sure that the web server on your computer is running and that all the files of the project are located at the root of the web server folder. The complete code for this part of the project is available at <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/openhomeautomation/geeky-projects-yun/tree/master/chapter2/web_interface">https://github.com/openhomeautomation/geeky-projects-yun/tree/master/chapter2/web_interface</a>.</p><p>You should see the two buttons of the interface show up in your browser, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8007OS_02_20.jpg" alt="Building an interface to switch the lights on/off remotely"/></div><p>You can now test this simple interface. Just click on a button and the PHP code should give the correct command on your Arduino Yún board, making the switch go on or off instantly.</p><p>You can also test the interface on a smartphone or tablet. I used my phone to do so. Just open your favorite browser, go to your computer's IP address or network name, and you should see the different files of your project being displayed. Just click on <span class="strong"><strong>interface.html</strong></span> and the interface should open and scale to your phone's screen size, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8007OS_02_21.jpg" alt="Building an interface to switch the lights on/off remotely"/></div><p>Just as for the interface on your computer, you can simply press a button and the light will switch on or off instantly. Now, <a id="id79" class="indexterm"/>you are able to command this light from wherever you are in your home; you just have to be connected to your local Wi-Fi network.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec18"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>Let's see what we learned in this project. At the beginning of the project, you saw how to interface the required components of this project to your Arduino Yún board: a relay module, a current sensor, and a lamp that will be controlled by the Yún board.</p><p>Then, we wrote a simple sketch to test the different components of the project and made sure that they all worked correctly.</p><p>Then, we built the energy consumption logging part of the project, and logged the power consumption inside a Google Docs spreadsheet. We also used the built-in capabilities of Google Docs to calculate the actual energy consumption, total energy cost, and on/off time of the device.</p><p>Finally, in the last part of the project, we built a graphical user interface to control the relay from a web browser, from your computer, or a smartphone/tablet.</p><p>Of course, there are many ways to take what you've learned in this project and extend it further. The first thing you can do is to add more devices to the project. For example, Arduino Yún has six analog inputs in total, so in theory you could plug the same number of current sensors into the Yún. Following the same principles, you could also add more Arduino Yún boards to the project.</p><p>You could also use the project with more features of Temboo, such as integrating the power measurements with social media, for example, by alerting the user with Twitter when the power consumption exceeds a given threshold. The user could then shut the lamp off by replying to this tweet.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will use other features of the Arduino Yún such as the USB port and the embedded Linux machine to create a wireless security camera. This camera will automatically upload pictures to a Dropbox folder and also stream the video live on YouTube so you can monitor your home remotely.</p></div></body></html>
