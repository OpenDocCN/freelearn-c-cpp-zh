- en: OpenGL is an ideal multiplatform, cross-language, and hardware-accelerated graphics
    rendering interface that is well suited to visualize large 2D and 3D datasets
    in many fields. In fact, OpenGL has become the industry standard to create stunning
    graphics, most notably in gaming applications and numerous professional tools
    for 3D modeling. As we collect more and more data in fields ranging from biomedical
    imaging to wearable computing (especially with the evolution of Big Data), a high-performance
    platform for data visualization is becoming an essential component of many future
    applications. Indeed, the visualization of massive datasets is becoming an increasingly
    challenging problem for developers, scientists, and engineers in many fields.
    Therefore, OpenGL can provide a unified solution for the creation of impressive,
    stunning visuals in many real-time applications.

    allowing users to have low-level control over the process. From a sophisticated
    multiserver setup to a mobile device, OpenGL libraries provide developers with
    an easy-to-use interface for high-performance graphics rendering. The increasing
    availability and capability of graphics hardware and mass storage devices, coupled
    with their decreasing cost, further motivate the development of interactive OpenGL-based
    data visualization tools.

    highly customized pieces of hardware designed to accelerate graphics rendering.
    GPUs can also be used to accelerate general-purpose, highly parallelizable computational
    tasks. By leveraging hardware and OpenGL, we can produce highly interactive and
    aesthetically pleasing results.

    applications and provides a step-by-step tutorial on how to set up the environment
    for our first demo application. In addition, this chapter outlines the steps to
    set up a popular tool called CMake, which is a cross-platform software that automates
    the process of generating standard build files (for example, makefiles in Linux
    that define the compilation parameters and commands) with simple configuration
    files. The CMake tool will be used to compile additional libraries in the future,
    including the GLFW (OpenGL FrameWork) library introduced later in this chapter.
    Briefly, the GLFW library is an open source, multiplatform library that allows
    users to create and manage windows with OpenGL contexts as well as handle inputs
    from peripheral devices such as the mouse and keyboard. By default, OpenGL itself
    does not support other peripherals; thus, the GLFW library is used to fill in
    the gap. We hope that this detailed tutorial will be especially useful for beginners
    who are interested in exploring OpenGL for data visualization but have little
    or no prior experience. However, we will assume that you are familiar with the
    C/C++ programming language.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By including the GLFW library header, `glfw3.h`, we automatically import all
    necessary files from the OpenGL library. Most importantly, GLFW automatically
    determines the platform and thus allows you to write portable source code seamlessly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the main function, we must first initialize the GLFW library with the **glfwInit**
    function in the main thread. This is required before any GLFW functions can be
    used. Before a program exits, GLFW should be terminated to release any allocated
    resources.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, the **glfwCreateWindow** function creates a window and its associated
    context, and it also returns a pointer to the `GLFWwindow` object. Here, we can
    define the width, height, title, and other properties for the window. After the
    window is created, we then call the **glfwMakeContextCurrent** function to switch
    the context and make sure that the context of the specified window is current
    on the calling thread.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At this point, we are ready to render our graphics element on the window. The
    **while** loop provides a mechanism to redraw our graphics as long as the window
    remains open. OpenGL requires an explicit setup on the camera parameters; further
    details will be discussed in the upcoming chapters. In the future, we can provide
    different parameters to simulate perspective and also handle more complicated
    issues (such as anti-aliasing). For now, we have set up a simple scene to render
    a basic primitive shape (namely a triangle) and fixed the color for the vertices.
    Users can modify the parameters in the **glColor3f** and **glVertex3f** functions
    to change the color as well as the position of the vertices.
