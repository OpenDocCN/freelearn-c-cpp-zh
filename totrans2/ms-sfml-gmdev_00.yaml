- en: Designing a game from scratch can be one of the most difficult journeys to embark
    on. With the amount of work that goes into it, it’s would not be farfetched to
    compare game development to building a car. It combines many different areas of
    expertise that would, otherwise, not be overlapping, meaning the mastermind behind
    it has to, often enough, also act as the *Jack of all trades*. Not many other
    types of projects can claim that they found a way to combine advanced lighting
    calculations, accurate physics simulations, and the inner-workings of a fully
    fledged, stable, and self-sustaining economy-model into something cohesive. These
    are just some of those *trades* one has to pick up, and in the fast-growing world
    of gaming, new ones are constantly popping into existence. Among all of the noise,
    some patterns slowly begin to emerge as time passes by. With several different
    generations having access to gaming now, and a couple of them not knowing the
    world without it, certain expectations begin to form within the zeitgeist. The
    breath-taking inventions and technical demos of yesterday have become the common-place
    features of today, and the beacons of light shining onto tomorrow. Keeping up
    with these features and not being left behind in the dark is what makes a good
    game developer today, and that’s where we come in. Although it won’t teach you
    everything, this book will do a solid job at giving you an edge by not only expanding
    your repertoire of techniques and ideas, but also setting a clear goal into the
    future, that’s always going to keep progressing into something bigger and better.

- en: As the first two chapters fly by, you will learn about setting up a basic, yet
    powerful RPG-style game, built on top of flexible architectures used in today’s
    games. That same game will then be given extra graphical oomph, as we cover building
    an efficient particle system, capable of easy expansion and many different graphical
    options. Subsequently, you will be brought up to speed to the practicalities and
    benefits of creating custom tools, such as a map editor, for modifying and managing
    the assets of your game. Usage of SFML’s shaders will also be touched on, right
    before we embark on a journey of cutting SFML out completely in [Chapter 7](ch07.html
    "Chapter 7.  One Step Forward, One Level Down - OpenGL Basics"), *One Step Forward,
    One Level Down – Integrating OpenGL*, by using raw OpenGL and rendering something
    on screen all by ourselves. This is followed by us exploring and implementing
    advanced lighting techniques, such as normal and specular maps, to really give
    the game scene a graphical kick with dynamic lights. Of course, there can be no
    light that doesn’t cast a shadow, which is why [Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. 
    The Speed of Dark - Lighting and Shadows"), *The Speed of Dark – Lighting and
    Shadows*, covers and implements shadow-mapping in 3D, allowing us to have realistic,
    three-dimensional shadows. This is all topped off by making final optimizations
    to the game that will not only make it run as fast as possible, but also provide
    you with all of the tools and skills necessary to keep making improvements into
    the future.

- en: While this book aims to inspire you to be the *Jack of all trades*, it will
    also make you a master of some by enabling your games to look and run as good
    as they possibly can. There is a long road ahead of us, so make sure you pack
    your ambition, and hopefully we shall see each other again at the finish line.
    Good luck!

- en: First and foremost, a compiler that supports new C++ standards is required.
    The actual SFML library is also needed, as it powers the game we’re building.
    Chapters 7 and up require the newest versions of the GLEW and GLM libraries as
    well. Any other individual tools that may be used throughout the course of this
    book have been mentioned in the individual chapters they’re used in.
