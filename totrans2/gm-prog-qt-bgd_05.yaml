- en: When it comes to graphics, we have so far been using only ready-made widgets
    for the user interface, which resulted in the crude approach of using buttons
    for a tic-tac-toe game. In this chapter, you will learn about much of what Qt
    has to offer with regard to custom graphics. This will let you not only create
    your own widgets, incorporating content that is entirely customized, but also
    integrate multimedia in your programs. You will also learn about employing your
    OpenGL skills to display fast 3D graphics. If you are not familiar with OpenGL,
    this chapter should give you a kick-start for further research in this topic.
    By the end of the chapter, you will be able to create 2D and 3D graphics for your
    games using classes offered by Qt and integrate them with the rest of the user
    interface.

- en: When it comes to graphics, Qt splits this domain into two separate parts. One
    of them is raster graphics (used by widgets, for example). This part focuses on
    using high-level operations (such as drawing lines or filling rectangles) to manipulate
    colors of a grid of points that can be visualized on different devices, such as
    images or the display of your computer device. The other is vector graphics, which
    involves manipulating vertices, triangles, and textures. This is tailored for
    maximum speed of processing and display using hardware acceleration provided by
    modern graphics cards. Qt abstracts graphics by using the concept of a surface
    that it draws on. The surface (represented by the `QSurface` class) can be of
    one of two types—`RasterSurface` or `OpenGLSurface`. The surface can be further
    customized using the `QSurfaceFormat` class, but we will talk about that later
    as it is not important right now.

- en: In general, Qt's drawing architecture consists of three parts. The most important
    part is the device the drawing takes place on, represented by the `QPaintDevice`
    class. Qt provides a number of paint device subclasses such as `QWidget` or `QImage`
    and `QPrinter` or `QPdfWriter`. You can see that the approach for drawing on a
    widget and printing on a printer will be quite the same. The difference is in
    the second component of the architecture—the paint engine (`QPaintEngine`). The
    engine is responsible for performing the actual paint operations on a particular
    paint device. Different paint engines are used to draw on images and to print
    on printers. This is completely hidden from you as a developer, so you really
    don't need to worry about it.

- en: 'For you, the most important piece is the third component—`QPainter`—which is
    an adapter for the whole painting framework. It contains a set of high-level operations
    that can be invoked on the paint device. Behind the scenes, the whole work is
    delegated to an appropriate paint engine. While talking about painting, we will
    be focusing solely on the painter object as any painting code can be invoked on
    any of the target devices only by using a painter initialized on a different paint
    device. This effectively makes painting in Qt device agnostic, like in the following
    example:'

- en: The `QPainter` class has a rich API that can basically be divided into three
    groups of methods. The first group contains setters and getters for attributes
    of the painter. The second group consists of methods, with names starting with
    `draw` and `fill` that perform drawing operations on the device. The last group
    has other methods, mostly ones that allow manipulating the coordinate system of
    the painter.

- en: Let's start with the attributes. The three most important ones are the font,
    pen, and brush. The first is an instance of the `QFont` class. It contains a large
    number of methods for controlling such font parameters as font family, style (italic
    or oblique), font weight, and font size (either in points or device-dependent
    pixels). All the parameters are self-explanatory, so we will not discuss them
    here in detail. It is important to note that `QFont` can use any font installed
    on the system. In case more control over fonts is required or a font that is not
    installed in the system needs to be used, one can take advantage of the `QFontDatabase`
    class. It provides information about available fonts (such as whether a particular
    font is scalable or bitmap or what writing systems it supports) and allows adding
    new fonts into the registry by loading their definitions directly from files.

    are performed. The pen defines the outline, and the brush fills the shapes drawn
    using the painter. The former is represented by the `QPen` class and the latter
    by `QBrush`. Each of them is really a set of parameters. The most simple one is
    the color defined either as a predefined global color enumeration value (such
    as `Qt::red` or `Qt::transparent`) or an instance of the `QColor` class. The effective
    color is made up of four attributes—three color components (red, green, and blue)
    and an optional alpha channel value that determines transparency of the color
    (the larger the value, the more opaque the color). By default, all components
    are expressed as 8-bit values (0 to 255) but can also be expressed as real values
    representing a percentage of the maximum saturation of the component; for example,
    0.6 corresponds to 153 (*0.6*255*). For convenience, one of the `QColor` constructors
    accepts hexadecimal color codes used in HTML (with `#0000FF` being an opaque blue
    color) or even bare color names (for example, `blue`) from a predefined list of
    colors returned by a static function `QColor::colorNames()`. Once a color object
    is defined using RGB components, it can be queried using different color spaces
    (for example, CMYK or HSV). Also, a set of static methods are available that act
    as constructors for colors expressed in different color spaces. For example, to
    construct a clear magenta color, any of the following expressions can be used:'

    which constitutes a so-called cosmetic pen that is always drawn as a 1 pixel-wide
    line no matter what transformations are applied to the painter (we'll cover this
    later). A pen can of course have a color set but, in addition to that, you can

    in fact has two coordinate systems. One is its own logical coordinate system that
    operates on real numbers, and the other is the physical coordinate system of the
    device the painter operates on. Each operation on the logical coordinate system
    is mapped to physical coordinates in the device and applied there. Let's start
    with explaining the logical coordinate system first, and then we'll see how this
    relates to physical coordinates.

- en: The painter represents an infinite Cartesian canvas with the horizontal axis
    pointing right and the vertical axis pointing down by default. The system can
    be modified by applying affine transformations to it—translating, rotating, scaling,
    and shearing. This way, you can draw an analog clock face that marks each hour
    with a line by executing a loop that rotates the coordinate system by 30 degrees
    for each hour and draws a line that is vertical in the newly obtained coordinate
    system. Another example is when you wish to draw a simple plot with *x* axis going
    right and *y* axis going up. To obtain the proper coordinate system, you would
    scale the coordinate system by `-1` in the vertical direction, effectively reversing
    the direction of the vertical axis.

- en: What we described here modifies the world transformation matrix for the painter
    represented by an instance of the `QTransform` class. You can always query the
    current state of the matrix by calling `transform()` on the painter and you can
    set a new matrix by calling `setTransform()`. `QTransform` has methods such as
    `scale()`, `rotate()`, and `translate()` that modify the matrix, but `QPainter`
    has equivalent methods for manipulating the world matrix directly. In most cases,
    using these would be preferable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each painting operation is expressed in logical coordinates, goes through the
    world transformation matrix, and reaches the second stage of coordinate manipulation,
    which is the view matrix. The painter has the concept of `viewport()` and `window()`
    rectangles. The `viewport` rectangle represents the physical coordinates of an
    arbitrary rectangle while the `window` rectangle expresses the same rectangle
    but in logical coordinates. Mapping one to another gives a transformation that
    needs to be applied to each drawn primitive to calculate the area of the physical
    device that is to be painted. By default, the two rectangles are identical to
    the rectangle of the underlying device (thus no `window`-`viewport` mapping is
    done). Such transformation is useful if you wish to perform painting operations
    using measurement units other than the pixels of the target device. For example,
    if you want to express coordinates using percentages of the width and height of
    the target device, you would set the window width and height both to `100`. Then,
    to draw a line starting at 20% of the width and 10% of the height and ending at
    70% of the width and 30% of the height, you would tell the painter to draw the
    line between (`20`, `10`) and (`70`, `30`). If you wanted those percentages to
    apply not to the whole area of an image but rather to its left half, you set the
    viewport rectangle only to the left half of the image.

    `QPainter` has a rich set of operations for drawing different kinds of primitives.
    All of these operations have the prefix `draw` in their names, followed by the
    name of the primitive that is to be drawn. Thus, such operations as `drawLine`,
    `drawRoundedRect`, and `drawText` are available with a number of overloads that
    usually allow us to express coordinates using different data types. These may
    be pure values (either integer or real), Qt's classes, such as `QPoint` and `QRect`,
    or their floating point equivalents—`QPointF` and `QRectF`. Each operation is
    performed using current painter settings (font, pen, and brush).

    methods directly as the constructor of `QPainter` calls `begin()` for us and the

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Qt has two classes for handling images. The first one is `QImage`, more tailored
    towards direct pixel manipulation. You can check the size of the image or check
    and modify the color of each pixel. You can convert the image into a different
    internal representation (say from 8-bit color map to full 32-bit color with a
    premultiplied alpha channel). This type, however, is not that fit for rendering.
    For that, we have a different class called `QPixmap`. The difference between the
    two classes is that `QImage` is always kept in the application memory, while `QPixmap`
    can only be a handle to a resource that may reside in the graphics card memory
    or on a remote *X* server. Its main advantage over `QImage` is that it can be
    rendered very quickly at the cost of the inability to access pixel data. You can
    freely convert between the two types but bear in mind that, on some platforms,
    this might be an expensive operation. Always consider which class serves your
    particular situation better. If you intend to crop the image, tint it with some
    color, or paint over it, `QImage` is a better choice. But if you just want to
    render a bunch of icons, it's best to keep them as `QPixmap` instances.

    be done in two ways. The first one is to use the `loadFromData()` method (it exists
    in both `QPixmap` and `QImage`), which behaves the same as when loading an image
    from a file—you pass it a data buffer and the size of the buffer and based on
    that, the loader determines the image type by inspecting the header data and loads
    the picture into `QImage` or `QPixmap`. The second situation is when you don't
    have images stored in a "filetype" such as JPEG or PNG but rather you have raw
    pixel data itself. In such a situation, `QImage` offers a constructor that takes
    a pointer to a block of data together with the size of the image and format of
    the data. The format is not a file format such as the ones listed earlier but
    rather a memory layout for data representing a single pixel.
  prefs: []

    is represented by 32-bits (4 bytes) of data divided equally between alpha, red,
    green, and blue channels—8-bits per channel. Another popular format is `QImage::Format_ARGB32_Premultiplied`,
    where values for the red, green, and blue channels are stored after being multiplied
    by the value of the alpha channel, which often results in faster rendering. You
    can change the internal data representation using a call to `convertToFormat()`.

    is very similar: there is a call to a custom draw method that accepts a pointer
    to the painter and index of the rank, column, or both of them, respectively. Each
    of the calls is surrounded by executing `save()` and `restore()`on our `QPainter`

    of these methods takes the painter instance as its parameter, overrides of these
    methods could alter attribute values of the painter behind our back. Calling `save()`
    before handing the painter over to such override stores its state on an internal
    stack, and calling `restore()` after returning from the override resets the painter

    rectangle to give it a more elegant look. Note how we modify attributes of the

- en: There are basically two ways you can use OpenGL in Qt. The first approach is
    to use `QOpenGLWidget`. This is mostly useful if your application heavily depends
    on other widgets (for example. the 3D view is only one of the views in your application
    and is controlled using a bunch of other widgets surrounding the main view). The
    other way is to use `QOpenGLWindow`; this is most useful when the GL window is
    the dominant or even the only part of the program. Both APIs are very similar;
    they use instances of the `QOpenGLContext` class to access the GL context. The
    difference is practically only in how they render the scene to the window. `QOpenGLWindow`
    renders directly to the given window, while `QOpenGLWidget` first renders to an
    offscreen buffer that is then rendered to the widget. The advantage of the latter
    approach is that `QOpenGLWidget` can be part of a more complex widget layout while
    `QOpenGLWindow` is usually used as the sole, often fullscreen, window. In this
    chapter we will be using the more direct approach (`QOpenGLWindow`); however,
    bear in mind that you can do everything described here using the widget too. Just
    replace the window classes with their widget equivalents and you should be good
    to go.
  prefs: []

- en: A related concept that needs explanation is the idea of a GL context being "current"
    in a thread. The way OpenGL calls work is that they do not use any handle to any
    object containing information on where and how to execute the series of low-level
    GL calls. Instead, it is assumed that they are executed in the context of the
    current machine state. The state may dictate whether to render a scene to a screen
    or to a frame buffer object, which mechanisms are enabled, or the properties of
    the surface OpenGL is rendering on. Making a context "current" means that all
    further OpenGL operations issued by a particular thread will be applied to this
    context. To add to that, a context can be "current" only in one thread at the
    same time; therefore, it is important to make the context current before making
    any OpenGL calls and then marking it as available after you are done accessing
    OpenGL resources.

    from the developer. Apart from constructors and a destructor, it provides a small

    the OpenGL context: `context()`, which returns the context, and `makeCurrent()`
    as well as `doneCurrent()` for acquiring and releasing the context. The remaining
    methods of the class are a number of virtual methods we can reimplement to display
    OpenGL graphics.'

    it so that you can prepare yourself for the fact that the next call to the other
    method, `paintGL()`, renders to a viewport of a different size. Speaking of `paintGL()`,

    vertices one by one into a fixed OpenGL pipeline. Nowadays, modern hardware is
    much more feature rich and not only does it allow faster processing of vertex
    data but it also offers the ability to adjust different processing stages with
    the use of reprogrammable units called shaders. In this section, we will take
    a look at what Qt has to offer in the domain of a "modern" approach to using OpenGL.

- en: Qt can make use of shaders through a set of classes based around `QOpenGLShaderProgram`.
    This class allows compiling, linking, and executing shader programs written in
    GLSL. You can check if your OpenGL implementation supports shaders by inspecting
    the result of a static `QOpenGLShaderProgram::hasOpenGLShaderPrograms()` call
    that accepts a pointer to a GL context. All modern hardware and all decent graphics
    drivers should have some support for shaders. A single shader is represented by
    an instance of the `QOpenGLShader` class. Using it, you can decide on the type
    of shader, associate, and shader source code. The latter is done by calling `QOpenGLShader::compileSourceCode()`,
    which has a number of overloads for handling different input formats.

    by using `QOpenGLShaderProgram::addShader()`. After all shaders are added, you
    can `link()` the program and `bind()` it to the current GL context. The program
    class has a number of methods for setting values of different input parameters—uniforms
    and attributes both in singular and array versions. Qt provides mappings between
    its own types (such as `QSize` or `QColor`) to GLSL counterparts (for example,
    `vec2` and `vec4`) to make the programmer's life even easier.
