- en: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a growing topic in the tech world, and more
    and more hardware projects that are funded using crowd-funding campaigns include
    some connected objects. Such objects can be smart watches that connect to the
    Web, the weather station, cameras, energy monitoring devices, and even robots.
    Many industry giants such as Google and Samsung are also entering the market with
    connected objects and wearable devices.

- en: On the other hand, millions of people around the world use the Arduino platform
    to create hardware projects. Because Arduino is so easy to use, it allows not
    only hobbyists, but also artists and people without a tech background to create
    amazing hardware projects. The platform is always evolving with new solutions
    that allow people to create more and more complex DIY projects.

- en: One of the latest boards from Arduino—the Arduino Yún—mixes these two worlds
    harmoniously. This board's release was appreciated by hobbyists around the world
    who wanted to develop connected objects. Indeed, developing applications for IoT
    has always been quite complex and requires a lot of expertise in both hardware
    and web applications development. However, we are going to see why using the Arduino
    Yún can make the process much easier.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Arduino Yún is the same size as the Arduino Uno, which is the most common
    Arduino board. However, the difference is that it features a small Linux machine
    that runs on a separate processor as well as an onboard Wi-Fi chip so you can
    connect the board to your local Wi-Fi network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The clever thing they did with the Arduino Yún board is create a Bridge library
    that allows you to call functions of the Linux machine from the usual Arduino
    microcontroller that is also present on the board. This way, you can use the powerful
    features of the Linux machine by programming in the same way as you would on the
    Arduino Uno board. You can, for example, write whole programs in high-level languages
    such as Python, and call them from an Arduino sketch.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The fact that the board also has onboard Wi-Fi changes everything. The board
    was developed in close collaboration with the Temboo web service, which provides
    many libraries to interface the board with other web services such as Google Docs,
    Gmail, and Dropbox.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For all these reasons, using the Arduino Yún will allow you to build connected
    applications without requiring you to be an expert in the field. Using the power
    of the embedded Linux machine, the Wi-Fi connection, and the Temboo libraries,
    you will be able to easily create your own IoT devices. To show you what exactly
    the Arduino Yún can do, I have built four exciting projects using this board,
    and you too will be able to build these projects after reading this book.

    Cloud"), *Building a Weather Station Connected to the Cloud*, introduces you to
    the Internet of Things features of the Arduino Yún. In this chapter, we are going
    to build a weather measurement station (which measures the temperature, humidity,
    and light levels) that sends data to the Web. The project will send data to a
    Google Docs spreadsheet via Temboo and log the results in the spreadsheet where
    they can be displayed graphically. The nice thing about this project is that this
    data can then be accessed from anywhere in the world just by logging into your
    Google account and going to the spreadsheet.'

    Device"), *Creating a Remote Energy Monitoring and Control Device*, focuses on
    energy management by creating a project to switch a device on and off (like a
    lamp), measuring its energy consumption and storing this data to the Web. We are
    going to interface a current sensor to measure the energy consumption of the device
    that is connected to the project. The project will also be able to switch the
    device on and off remotely, and we are going to build an interface for you to
    control this switch from your computer and mobile device.'

    *Making Your Own Cloud-connected Camera*, allows us to build our own DIY version
    of a wireless security camera by connecting a standard USB webcam to the Arduino
    Yún. We will perform two exciting applications with this project: first, we will
    automatically upload pictures from the camera when some motion is detected in
    front of it, and then we are going to make the camera stream video live from YouTube,
    so you can monitor what is going on in your home from anywhere.'

    robot with two wheels and an ultrasonic distance sensor in front of it. Additionally,
    we are going to use the powerful features of the Arduino Yún to easily control
    this robot via Wi-Fi. To do this, we are going to build a web interface that will
    be used to control the movement of the robot, and this will also display the distance
    measured by the front sensor.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main focus of this book is the Arduino Yún board; so, of course, you will
    need one of the Arduino Yún boards to make all four projects of the book. Depending
    on the chapter, you will also need several hardware components. The details of
    these components required are given at the beginning of each chapter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will also need to have some software installed on your computer to make
    the projects work. The first one is the Arduino IDE's latest beta version (the
    only version that can work with the Yún). For all these projects, I used the Arduino
    IDE Version 1.5.6-r2, but all the newer versions should work as well. You can
    download the Arduino IDE at [http://arduino.cc/en/main/software#toc3](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software#toc3).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will also need a web server running on your computer for some of the projects.
    I recommend that you use a software that integrates a web server and a database,
    and that handles all the details for you. If you are using Windows, I recommend
    using EasyPHP, which is available at [http://www.easyphp.org/](http://www.easyphp.org/).

- en: All the projects assume that your Arduino Yún board is already configured and
    connected to your Wi-Fi network. To configure and connect the Yún to your Wi-Fi
    network, there are only a few steps to follow. The first one is to plug the Arduino
    board in to the wall and wait for a moment.

    to enter a password for your Yún board; please enter one that you can remember
    easily, as you will need it many times while attempting the projects in this book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, you will be taken to a new page that contains some information about your
    Yún board. You can change the name of the board (which we will use later in all
    the projects), and also set your Wi-Fi parameters. You have to set these parameters
    so that the board can connect to your home Wi-Fi network. Choose the correct network
    from the list, enter your password, and click on **Configure & Restart**.

    also reconnect your computer to the local Wi-Fi network. After a while, you can

    on the configuration page of the Yún, where you have to select **OPEN**, which
    is close to **REST API ACCESS**. Reboot the Yún board again when the option has
    been changed.
