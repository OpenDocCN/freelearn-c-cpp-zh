Upon Unreal's first release, it was known as a great first-person shooter game engine, but with the success of games such as WB's <span class="emphasis"><em>Mortal Kombat</em></span>, Chair Entertainment's <span class="emphasis"><em>Shadow Complex</em></span>, and Epic Games' <span class="emphasis"><em>Gears of War</em></span>, along with highly anticipated upcoming games such as Capcom's <span class="emphasis"><em>Street Fighter 5</em></span>, Comcept's <span class="emphasis"><em>Mighty No. 9</em></span>, and Square Enix's <span class="emphasis"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></span>, Unreal has proven itself to be one of the greatest engines to use when creating virtually any genre of game. This book will lay the foundations of creating a turn-based RPG in Unreal Engine 4.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
