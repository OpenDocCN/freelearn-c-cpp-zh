- en: Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) is an incredibly powerful set of technologies that are
    now available to anyone and everyone for free. From students to large teams working
    on a variety of games and platforms, it provides a means to bring all manner of
    apps and games to the public. This book is all about building the confidence of
    those who use it and raising the level of developers to a master level, where
    any problem and any challenge in any project is solvable.

- en: '[Chapter 1](dfc11944-e8b6-45b1-8997-5f1a59d0f8ac.xhtml), *Making a C++ Project
    for a First-Person Shooter*, is our starting point for the whole book and its
    corresponding UE4 project on GitHub. We''ll start by installing the engine and
    building it in C++. Then we''ll add the first-person shooter template Unreal supplies
    for us, go over building it in C++ as well, and then add a new player class and
    controls.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](5cc3645d-8420-4178-9897-2c71100caeac.xhtml), *Inventory and Weapons
    for the Player*, adds some basics of gameplay and gets you comfortable with adding
    C++ classes and connecting them to blueprints in the editor. By the end of the
    chapter, the player has a fully functional inventory system, including picking
    up items and cycling through them with new controls.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](267b875d-60d1-4f92-abf5-76d2e682a12d.xhtml), *Blueprint Review
    and when to Use BP Scripting*, is a section where we examine UE4''s Blueprint
    scripting system and its advantages and disadvantages in some detail, including
    a practical implementation in our game''s map.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](eadb37a8-4ecb-4fc9-b391-e65671c99fc0.xhtml), *UI Necessities, Menus,
    HUD, and Load/Save*, quickly accelerates into some deeper topics: after first
    getting our UI and HUD set up and hooked to our inventory, we''ll deep dive into
    UE4''s filesystem and other classes to implement a save-anywhere load/save system
    and hook that up via the UI as well.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](85d4cfea-890c-4635-a4ca-8fa523b870c6.xhtml), *Adding Enemies!*, covers
    how to import a new character and build and hook up its entire AI system to notice,
    animate to, and attack our player.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](978665f4-5638-4a71-9f86-c0349e090ae7.xhtml), *Changing Levels,
    Streaming, and Retaining Data*, explains that switching maps (levels) in UE4 or
    utilizing one of its streaming options is a must for all games. We''ll take some
    time to get familiar with Unreal''s options here and then move on to retaining
    data when changing maps. We''ll adapt our load/save system to allow our player
    to persist inventory across levels while also retaining the state of each map
    as it was left.'

    Your Game,* discusses how audio is an often-overlooked aspect of games that can
    make or break their immersion! After an overview of UE4''s major audio systems,
    we''ll dive into topics such as material-based impact sounds and environmental
    effects.'

    Optimization Tips*, explains that materials and the shaders they create are arguably
    Unreal''s most important system. The visuals possible in UE4 are nearly limitless,
    but you need to have an understanding of the limits and costs when using them.
    We''ll go through some practical examples of creating new materials and profiling
    them to get familiar with how to optimize your shaders and adapt to different
    platforms.'

    Cutscene with Sequencer*, introduces the reader to Sequencer, the in-game cutscene
    tool that''s mainly used and supported in UE4 now. After making an in-game scene
    with our player and enemy AI, we''ll discuss some alternatives to Sequencer.'

- en: '[Chapter 10](5fc16cd9-a5d9-4181-8373-0ad5775cc688.xhtml), *Packaging the Game
    (PC, mobile),* explains that no game is complete if it can''t be put and run on
    its target platform!  Here we''ll go through some examples of packaging the game
    and installing it, and discuss some of the differences in UE4 between launching
    on a device and doing a standalone build.'

    but its lighting is well-known and respected in the industry as top-notch. This
    chapter explores some of the advanced lighting available and explains how to add
    it to our game. It also covers adding and modifying both atmospheric and volume
    fog.'

    Visual Effects,* explores UE4''s Media Framework and some of the cool things it
    provides.  Specifically, we''ll take some video of the game''s earlier in-game
    scene and play it in-game as a video file (MP4). We''ll also explore Unreal''s
    particle systems and physics particles, adding these to our projectile impacts.'

    growing list of platforms: VR and AR. In this final chapter, we''ll create two
    standalone projects (one for each) and modify and implement the unique features
    of each of them, including porting our projectiles from the main project into
    our AR project.'

- en: Fundamental comfort with using Unreal Engine 4 is an important starting point,
    but it's not mandatory. The objective of this book is to take those who work with
    the technology to a level where they are comfortable enough with all aspects to
    be a leader and driver of that technology on a project. While UE4 is a multi-platform
    set of technology, a Windows PC with Visual Studio is the primary development
    platform. MacBook Pro and XCode are also used frequently, and Android phones (including
    GearVR) and iOS devices are also represented.
