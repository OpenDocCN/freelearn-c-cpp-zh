			<p><strong class="bold">TableGen</strong> is a <strong class="bold">domain-specific language</strong> (<strong class="bold">DSL</strong>) that was originally developed in <strong class="bold">Low-Level Virtual Machine</strong> (<strong class="bold">LLVM</strong>) to express processors' <strong class="bold">instruction set architecture</strong> (<strong class="bold">ISA</strong>) and other hardware-specific details, similar to the <strong class="bold">GNU Compiler Collection's</strong> (<strong class="bold">GCC's</strong>) <strong class="bold">Machine Description</strong> (<strong class="bold">MD</strong>). Thus, many people learn TableGen when they're dealing with LLVM's backend development. However, TableGen is not just for describing hardware specifications: it is a <em class="italic">general DSL</em> useful for any tasks that involve non-trivial <em class="italic">static and structural data</em>. LLVM has also been using TableGen on parts outside the backend. For example, Clang has been using TableGen for its command-line options management. People in the community are also exploring the possibility to implement <strong class="bold">InstCombine</strong> rules (LLVM's <strong class="bold">peephole optimizations</strong>) in TableGen syntax.</p>
			<p>Despite TableGen's universality, the language's core syntax has never been widely understood by many new developers in this field, creating lots of copy-and-pasted boilerplate TableGen code in LLVM's code base since they're not familiar with the language <em class="italic">itself</em>. This chapter tries to shed a little bit of light on this situation and show the way to apply this amazing technique to a wide range of applications.</p>
			<p>The chapter starts with an introduction to common and important TableGen syntax, which prepares you for writing a delicious donut recipe in TableGen as a practice, culminating in a demonstration of TableGen's universality in the second part. Finally, the chapter will end with a tutorial to develop a custom <em class="italic">emitter</em>, or a <strong class="bold">TableGen backend</strong>, to convert those nerdy sentences in the TableGen recipe into normal plaintext descriptions that can be put in the kitchen.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>This chapter focuses on one tool in the <code>utils</code> folder: <code>llvm-tblgen</code>. To build it, launch the following command:</p>
			<pre>$ ninja llvm-tblgen</pre>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">If you chose to build <code>llvm-tblgen</code> in <code>LLVM_OPTIMIZED_TABLEGEN</code> CMake variable introduced in the first chapter, you might want to change that setting since it's always better to have a debug version of <code>llvm-tblgen</code> in this chapter.</p>
			<p>All of the source code in this chapter can be found in this GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLVM-Techniques-Tips-and-Best-Practices-Clang-and-Middle-End-Libraries/tree/main/Chapter04">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLVM-Techniques-Tips-and-Best-Practices-Clang-and-Middle-End-Libraries/tree/main/Chapter04</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Introduction to TableGen syntax</h1>
			<p>This section serves as a quick tour of all the important and common TableGen syntax, providing all the <a id="_idIndexMarker101"/>essential knowledge to get hands-on, writing a donut recipe in TableGen in the next section.</p>
			<p>TableGen is a <a id="_idIndexMarker102"/>domain-specific programming language used for modeling custom data layouts. Despite being a programming language, it does something <a id="_idIndexMarker103"/>quite different from conventional languages. <strong class="bold">Conventional programming languages</strong> usually describe <em class="italic">actions</em> performed on the (input) data, how they interact with the environment, and how they generate results, regardless of the programming paradigms (imperative, functional, event-driven…) you adopt. TableGen, in contrast, barely describes any actions.</p>
			<p>TableGen is designed <a id="_idIndexMarker104"/>only to describe structural <strong class="bold">static data</strong>. First, developers define the layout—which is essentially just a table with many fields—of their desired data structure. They then need to fill data into those layouts <em class="italic">right away</em> as most of the fields are populated/initialized. The latter part is probably what makes TableGen unique: many programming languages or frameworks provide ways to design your domain-specific data structures (for example, Google's <strong class="bold">Protocol Buffers</strong>), but in those scenarios, data <a id="_idIndexMarker105"/>is usually filled in <strong class="bold">dynamically</strong>, mostly in the code that consumes the DSL part.</p>
			<p><code>TABLE</code>; and in TableGen, it's <code>class</code>, which will be introduced later on in this section. However, SQL provides much more functions other than crafting the layout. It can also query (actually, that's where its name came from: <strong class="bold">Structured Query Language</strong>) and update data dynamically, which are absent in TableGen. However, later in this chapter, you will see that TableGen provides a nice framework to flexibly process and <em class="italic">interpret</em> this TableGen-defined data.</p>
			<p>We'll now introduce four important TableGen constructions, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Layout and records</li>
				<li>Bang operators</li>
				<li>Multiclass</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Directed-Acyclic Graph</strong> (<strong class="bold">DAG</strong>) data type</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>Layout and records</h2>
			<p>Given the fact that TableGen is just a more fancy and expressive way to describe structural data, it's pretty straightforward to think that there is a primitive representation <a id="_idIndexMarker107"/>for the data's <code>class</code> syntax, as shown in the following code snippet:</p>
			<pre><strong class="bold">class</strong> Person {
  string Name = "John Smith";
  int Age;
}</pre>
			<p>As shown here, a class is similar to a struct in C and many other programming languages, which only contains a group of data fields. Each field has a type, which can be any of the primitive types (<code>int</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>bit</code>, and so on) or another user-defined <code>class</code> type. A field can also assign a default value such as <code>John Smith</code>.</p>
			<p>After looking a layout, it's time to create an instance (or a <strong class="bold">record</strong>, in TableGen's terms), out of it, as follows:</p>
			<pre><strong class="bold">def john_smith</strong> : Person;</pre>
			<p>Here, <code>john_smith</code> is a record using <code>Person</code> as a template so that it also has two fields—<code>Name</code> and <code>Age</code>—with the <code>Name</code> field filled with the value <code>John Smith</code>. This looks pretty straightforward, but recall that TableGen should define static data and that <em class="italic">most</em> fields should <a id="_idIndexMarker108"/>be filled with values. Also, in this case, the <code>Age</code> field is still left uninitialized. You can populate its value by <em class="italic">overriding</em> with a bracket closure and statements within, as follows:</p>
			<pre>def john_smith : Person {
  <strong class="bold">let Age = 87;</strong>
}</pre>
			<p>You can even define new fields specifically for the <code>john_smith</code> record, as follows:</p>
			<pre>def john_smith : Person {
  let Age = 87;
  <strong class="bold">string Job = "Teacher";</strong>
}</pre>
			<p>Just be aware that you can only override fields (using the <code>let</code> keyword) that have been declared, just as with many other programming languages.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Bang operators</h2>
			<p>Bang operators <a id="_idIndexMarker109"/>are a group of functions performing <a id="_idIndexMarker110"/>simple tasks such as basic arithmetic or casting on values in TableGen. Here is a simple example of converting kilograms to grams:</p>
			<pre>class Weight&lt;int kilogram&gt; {
  int Gram = <strong class="bold">!mul(kilogram, 1000)</strong>;
}</pre>
			<p>Common operators include arithmetic and bitwise operators (to name but a few), and some <a id="_idIndexMarker111"/>of these <a id="_idIndexMarker112"/>are outlined here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>!add(a, b)</code>: For arithmetic addition</li>
				<li><code>!sub(a, b)</code>: For arithmetic subtraction</li>
				<li><code>!mul(a, b)</code>: For arithmetic multiplication</li>
				<li><code>!and(a, b)</code>: For logical <code>AND</code> operations</li>
				<li><code>!or(a, b)</code>: For logical <code>OR</code> operations</li>
				<li><code>!xor(a, b)</code>: For logical <code>XOR</code> operations</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We also <a id="_idIndexMarker113"/>use conditional operators, and a few are outlined here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>!ge(a, b)</code>: Returns 1 if <code>a &gt;= b</code>, and 0 otherwise</li>
				<li><code>!gt(a, b)</code>: Returns 1 if <code>a &gt; b</code>, and 0 otherwise</li>
				<li><code>!le(a, b)</code>: Returns 1 if <code>a &lt;= b</code>, and 0 otherwise</li>
				<li><code>!lt(a, b)</code>: Returns 1 if <code>a &lt; b</code>, and 0 otherwise</li>
				<li><code>!eq(a, b)</code>: Returns 1 if <code>a == b</code>, and 0 otherwise</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Other <a id="_idIndexMarker114"/>interesting operators include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>!cast&lt;type&gt;(x)</code>: This operator performs type casting on the <code>x</code> operand, according to the <code>type</code> parameter. In cases where the type is a numerical type, such as with <code>int</code> or <code>bits</code>, this performs normal arithmetic type casting. In some special cases, we have the following scenarios:<p>If <code>type</code> is string and <code>x</code> is a record, this returns the record's name.</p><p>If <code>x</code> is a string, it is treated as the name of a record. TableGen will look up all the record definitions so far and cast the one with the name of <code>x</code> and return it with a type that matches the <code>type</code> parameter.</p></li>
				<li><code>!if(pred, then, else)</code>: This operator returns the <code>then</code> expression if <code>pred</code> is 1, and returns the <code>else</code> expression otherwise.</li>
				<li><code>!cond(cond1 : val1, cond2 : val2, …, condN : valN)</code>: This operator <a id="_idIndexMarker115"/>is an enhanced version of the <code>!if</code> operator. It will continuously evaluate <code>cond1…condN</code> until one of the expressions returns 1, before returning its associated <code>val</code> expression.<p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">Unlike functions, which are evaluated during runtime, bang operators are more like <em class="italic">macros</em>, which are evaluated during build time—or in TableGen's terminology, when those syntaxes are processed by TableGen backends.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>Multiclass</h2>
			<p>There are <a id="_idIndexMarker116"/>many cases where we want to define multiple records at once. For example, the following snippet tries to create <em class="italic">auto part</em> records for multiple cars:</p>
			<pre>class AutoPart&lt;int quantity&gt; {…}
def car1_fuel_tank : AutoPart&lt;1&gt;;
def car1_engine : AutoPart&lt;1&gt;;
def car1_wheels : AutoPart&lt;4&gt;;
…
def car2_fuel_tank : AutoPart&lt;1&gt;;
def car2_engine : AutoPart&lt;1&gt;;
def car2_wheels : AutoPart&lt;4&gt;;
…</pre>
			<p>We can further simplify these by using the <code>multiclass</code> syntax, as follows:</p>
			<pre>class AutoPart&lt;int quantity&gt; {…}
<strong class="bold">multiclass</strong> Car&lt;int quantity&gt; {
  def _fuel_tank : AutoPart&lt;quantity&gt;;
  def _engine : AutoPart&lt;quantity&gt;;
  def _wheels : AutoPart&lt;!mul(quantity, 4)&gt;;
  …
}</pre>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker117"/>creating record instances, use the <code>defm</code> syntax instead of <code>def</code>, as follows:</p>
			<pre><strong class="bold">defm</strong> car1 : Car&lt;1&gt;;
<strong class="bold">defm</strong> car2 : Car&lt;1&gt;;</pre>
			<p>Thus, at the end, it will still generate records with names such as <code>car1_fuel_tank</code>, <code>car1_engine</code>,<code> car2_fuel_tank</code>, and so on.</p>
			<p>Despite having <code>class</code> in its name, <code>multiclass</code> has nothing to do with a class. Instead of describing the layout of a record, <code>multiclass</code> acts as a template to <em class="italic">generate</em> records. Inside a <code>multiclass</code> template are the prospective records to be created and the records' name <em class="italic">suffix</em> after the template is expanded. For example, the <code>defm car1 : Car&lt;1&gt;</code> directive in the preceding snippet will eventually be expanded into three <code>def</code> directives, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>def car1_fuel_tank : AutoPart&lt;1&gt;;</code></li>
				<li><code>def car1_engine : AutoPart&lt;1&gt;;</code></li>
				<li><code>def car1_wheels : AutoPart&lt;!mul(1, 4)&gt;;</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p>As you can see in the preceding list, the name suffixes we found inside <code>multiclass</code> (for instance, <code>_fuel_tank</code>) was concatenated with the name appearing after <code>defm</code>—c<code>ar1</code> in this case. Also, the <code>quantity</code> template argument from <code>multiclass</code>, was also instantiated into every expanded record.</p>
			<p>In short, <code>multiclass</code> tries to extract common parameters from multiple record instances and make it possible to create them at once. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>The DAG data type</h2>
			<p>In addition to conventional data types, TableGen has a pretty unique first-class type: the <code>dag</code> type <a id="_idIndexMarker118"/>that is used for expressing DAG instances. To create <a id="_idIndexMarker119"/>a DAG instance, you can use the following syntax:</p>
			<pre>(operator operand1, operand2,…, operandN)</pre>
			<p>While the <code>operator</code> can only be a record instance, operands (<code>operand1</code>…<code>operandN</code>) can have arbitrary types. Here is an example of trying to model an arithmetic expression, <code>x * 2 + y + 8 * z</code>:</p>
			<pre>class Variable {…}
class Operator {…}
class Expression&lt;<strong class="bold">dag expr</strong>&gt; {…}
// define variables
def x : Variable;
def y : Variable;
def z : Variable;
// define operators
def mul : Operator;
def plus : Operator;
// define expression
def tmp1 : Expression&lt;<strong class="bold">(mul x, 2)</strong>&gt;;
def tmp2 : Expression&lt;<strong class="bold">(mul 8, z)</strong>&gt;;
def result : Expression&lt;<strong class="bold">(plus tmp1, tmp2, y)</strong>&gt;;</pre>
			<p>Optionally, you can associate <code>operator</code> and/or each operand with a <em class="italic">tag</em>, as follows:</p>
			<pre>…
def tmp1 : Expression&lt;<strong class="bold">(mul:$op x, 2)</strong>&gt;;
def tmp2 : Expression&lt;<strong class="bold">(mul:$op 8, z)</strong>&gt;;
def result : Expression&lt;<strong class="bold">(plus tmp1:$term1, tmp2:$term2, y:$term3)</strong>&gt;;</pre>
			<p>A tag always starts with a dollar sign, <code>$</code>, followed by a user-defined tag name. These tags provide a <em class="italic">logical</em> description of each <code>dag</code> component and can be useful when processing DAGs in the TableGen backend.</p>
			<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>section, we have gone through the principal <a id="_idIndexMarker121"/>components of the TableGen language and introduced some essential syntax. In the next section, we are going to get hands-on, writing a delicious donut recipe using TableGen.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Writing a donut recipe in TableGen</h1>
			<p>With the <a id="_idIndexMarker122"/>knowledge from previous sections, it's time to write our own donut recipe! We'll proceed as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The first file to create is <code>Kitchen.td</code>. It defines the environment for cooking, including measuring units, equipment, and procedures, to name but a few aspects. We are going to start with the measuring units, as follows:<pre>class Unit {
  string Text;
  bit Imperial;
}</pre><p>Here, the <code>Text</code> field is the textual format showing on the recipe, and <code>Imperial</code> is just a Boolean flag marking whether this unit is imperial or metric. Each weight or volume unit will be a record inheriting from this class—have a look at the following code snippet for an example of this:</p><pre>def gram_unit : Unit {
  let Imperial = false;
  let Text = "g";
}
def tbsp_unit : Unit {
  let Imperial = true;
  let Text = "tbsp";
}</pre><p>There are plenty of measuring units we want to create, but the code is already pretty <a id="_idIndexMarker123"/>lengthy. A way to simplify and make it more readable is by using <code>class</code> template arguments, as follows:</p><pre>class Unit<strong class="bold">&lt;bit imperial, string text&gt;</strong> {
  string Text = <strong class="bold">text</strong>;
  bit Imperial = <strong class="bold">imperial</strong>;
}
def gram_unit : <strong class="bold">Unit&lt;false, "g"&gt;</strong>;
def tbsp_unit : <strong class="bold">Unit&lt;true, "tbsp"&gt;</strong>;</pre><p>In contrast to C++'s template arguments, the template arguments in TableGen only accept concrete values. They're just an alternative way to assign values to fields.</p></li>
				<li>Since TableGen doesn't support floating-point numbers, we need to define some way to express numberings, such as <code>Integral</code> and <code>DecimalPoint</code> fields mentioned, the value represented by this <code>FixedPoint</code> class is equal to the following formula:</p><p><em class="italic">Integral * 10^(-DecimalPoint)</em></p><p>Since ¼, ½, and ¾ are apparently commonly used in measuring (especially for imperial units such as a US cup), it's probably a good idea to use a helper class to create them, as follows:</p><pre>class NplusQuarter&lt;<code>class</code> is simply just integrating its fields.</p></li>
				<li>To implement <code>NplusQuarter</code>, especially the conversion from the <code>NplusQuarter</code> class <a id="_idIndexMarker124"/>template parameters to that of <code>FixedPoint</code>, we need some simple arithmetic calculations, which is where TableGen's bang operators come into place, as follows:<pre>class NplusQuarter&lt;<code>num_quarter</code> variable. By writing <code>num_quarter{1…0}</code>, this gives you a <code>bits</code> value that is equal to the 0th and first bit of <code>num_quarter</code>. There are some other variants of this technique. For example, it can slice a non-continuous range of bits, as follows:</p><pre>num_quarter{8…6,4,2…0}</pre><p>Or, it can extract bits in reversed ordering, as follows:</p><pre>num_quarter{1…7}</pre><p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">You might wonder why the code needs to extract the smallest 2 bits <em class="italic">explicitly</em> even it has declared that <code>num_quarter</code> has a width of 2 bits (the <code>bits&lt;2&gt;</code> type). It turned out that for some reason, TableGen will not stop anyone from assigning values greater than <code>3</code> into <code>num_quarter</code>, like this: <code>def x : NplusQuarter&lt;1,999&gt;</code>.</p></li>
				<li>With the measuring units and number format, we can finally deal with the ingredients <a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>needed for this recipe. First, let's use a separated file, <code>Ingredients.td</code>, to store all the ingredient records. To use all the things mentioned earlier, we can import <code>Kitchen.td</code> by using the <code>include</code> syntax, as follows:<pre>// In Ingredients.td…
include "Kitchen.td"</pre><p>Then, a base class of all ingredients is created to carry some common fields, as follows:</p><pre>class IngredientBase&lt;Unit unit&gt; {
  <code>IngredientBase</code>, with parameters to specify the quantity needed by a recipe, and the unit used to measure this ingredient. Take milk, for example, as shown in the following code snippet:</p><pre>class Milk&lt;<code>cup_unit</code> put at the template argument for <code>IngredientBase</code> tells us that milk is measured by a US cup unit, and its quantity is to be determined later by the <code>Milk</code> class template arguments. </p><p>When writing a recipe, each required ingredient is represented by a record created from one of these ingredient <code>class</code> types:</p><pre>def ingredient_milk : <strong class="bold">Milk&lt;1,2&gt;</strong>; // Need 1.5 cup of milk</pre></li>
				<li>Some ingredients, however, always come together—for example, lemon peel and lemon juice, egg yolk, and egg white. That is, if you have two egg yolks, then there must <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/>be two servings of egg white. However, if we need to create a record and assign a quantity for each of the ingredients one by one, there will be a lot of duplicate code. A more elegant way to solve this problem is by using TableGen's <code>multiclass</code> syntax.<p>Taking the following egg example, assume we want to create <code>WholeEgg</code>, <code>EggWhite</code>, and <code>EggYolk</code> records at once with the same quantity, and define the <code>multiclass</code> first:</p><pre><code>defm</code> syntax to create <code>multiclass</code> records, as follows:</p><pre>defm egg_ingredient : Egg&lt;3&gt;;</pre><p>After using <code>defm</code>, three records will actually be created: <code>egg_ingredient_whole</code>, <code>egg_ingredient_yolk</code>, and <code>egg_ingredient_white</code>, inheriting from <code>WholeEgg</code>, <code>EggYolk</code>, and <code>EggWhite</code>, respectively. </p></li>
				<li>Finally, we need a way to describe the steps to make a donut. Many recipes have some preparation steps that don't need to be done in a specific order. Take the <a id="_idIndexMarker127"/>donut recipe here, for example: preheating the oil can be done at any time before the donuts are ready to be fried. Thus, it might be a good idea to express baking steps in a <code>dag</code> type.<p>Let's first create the <code>class</code> to represent a baking step, as follows:</p><pre>class Step&lt;<code>Action</code> field carries the baking instructions and information about the ingredients used. Here is an example:</p><pre>def <code>Action</code> is just a class used for describing movements. The following snippet represents the fact that <code>step_mixing2</code> is using the outcome from <code>step_mixing</code> (maybe a raw dough) and mixing it with butter:</p><pre>…
def step_mixing : Step&lt;(mix milk, flour), …&gt;;
def step_mixing2 : Step&lt;<code>Step</code> records will form a DAG, in which a vertex will either be a <code>step</code> or an ingredient record.</p><p>We're also <a id="_idIndexMarker128"/>annotating our <code>dag</code> operator and operand with tags, as follows:</p><pre>def step_mixing2 : Step&lt;(mix:<code>dag</code> tags have no immediate effect in TableGen code, except affecting how TableGen backends handle the current record—for example, if we have a <code>string</code> type field, <code>CustomFormat</code>, in the <code>Step</code> class, as follows:</p><pre>def step_prep : Step&lt;(heat:<code>$action</code>, <code>$oil</code>, and <code>$temp</code> in the string with the textual representation of those records, generating a string such as <em class="italic">heat the peanut oil until it reaches 300 F</em>.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>And that wraps up this section of this chapter. In the next section, the goal is to develop a custom TableGen backend to take the TableGen version recipe here as input and print out a normal plaintext recipe.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Printing a recipe via the TableGen backend</h1>
			<p>Following up <a id="_idIndexMarker129"/>on the last part of the previous <a id="_idIndexMarker130"/>section, after composing the donut recipe in TableGen's syntax, it's time to print out a <em class="italic">normal</em> recipe from that via a custom-built TableGen backend. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Please <a id="_idIndexMarker131"/>don't confuse a <strong class="bold">TableGen backend</strong> with a <strong class="bold">LLVM backend</strong>: the <a id="_idIndexMarker132"/>former converts (or transpiles) TableGen files into an <em class="italic">arbitrary textual content</em>, C/C++ header files being the most common form. An LLVM <a id="_idIndexMarker133"/>backend, on the other hand, lowers LLVM <strong class="bold">intermediate representations</strong> (<strong class="bold">IR</strong>) into low-level assembly code. </p>
			<p>In this section, we're developing the TableGen backend to print the donut we composed in the previous section into content, like this:</p>
			<pre>=======Ingredients=======
1. oil 500 ml
2. flour 300 g
3. milk 1.25 cup
4. whole egg 1
5. yeast 1.50 tsp
6. butter 3.50 tbsp
7. sugar 2.0 tbsp
8. salt 0.50 tsp
9. vanilla extract 1.0 tsp
=======Instructions=======
1. use deep fryer to heat oil until 160 C
2. use mixer to mix flour, milk, whole egg, yeast, butter, sugar, salt, and vanilla extract. stir in low speed.
3. use mixer to mix outcome from (step 2). stir in medium speed.
4. use bowl to ferment outcome from (step 3).
5. use rolling pin to flatten outcome from (step 4).
6. use cutter to cut outcome from (step 5).
7. use deep fryer to fry outcome from (step 1) and outcome from (step 6).</pre>
			<p>First, we <a id="_idIndexMarker134"/>will give an overview of <code>llvm-tblgen</code>, the program for driving the TableGen translation process. Then, we will show you <a id="_idIndexMarker135"/>how to develop our recipe-printing TableGen backend. Finally, we'll show you how to integrate our backend into the <code>llvm-tblgen</code> executable.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>TableGen's high-level workflow</h2>
			<p>The TableGen backend takes in-memory representation (in the form of C++ objects) of the TableGen <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>code we just learned and transforms it into <a id="_idIndexMarker137"/>arbitrary <code>llvm-tblgen</code> executable, whose workflow can be illustrated by this diagram:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.1_B14590.jpg" alt="Figure 4.1 – Workflow of llvm-tblgen &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.1 – Workflow of llvm-tblgen </p>
			<p>TableGen code's in-memory representation (which consists of C++ types and APIs) plays an important role in the TableGen backend development. Similar to LLVM IR, it is organized <em class="italic">hierarchically</em>. Starting from the top level, here is a list of its hierarchy, where each of the items is a C++ class:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1"><code>RecordKeeper</code>: A collection (and owner) of all <code>Record</code> objects in the current translation unit.</li>
				<li><code>Record</code>: Represents a record or a <code>class</code>. The enclosing fields are represented by <code>RecordVal</code>. If it's a <code>class</code>, you can also access its template arguments.</li>
				<li><code>RecordVal</code>: Represents a <em class="italic">pair</em> of record fields and their initialized value, along with supplementary information such as the field's type and source location.</li>
				<li><code>Init</code>: Represents the initialized value of a field. It is a parent class of <code>many</code>, which represents different types of initialized values—For example, <code>IntInit</code> for integer values and <code>DagInit</code> for DAG values.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To give <a id="_idIndexMarker138"/>you a little task on the practical aspect of a TableGen backend, here is the skeleton of it:</p>
			<pre>class SampleEmitter {
  RecordKeeper &amp;Records;
public:
  SampleEmitter(RecordKeeper &amp;RK) : Records(RK) {}
  void run(raw_ostream &amp;OS);
};</pre>
			<p>This emitter basically takes a <code>RecordKeeper</code> object (passed in by the constructor) as the input and prints the output into the <code>raw_ostream</code> stream—the function argument of <code>SampleEmitter::run</code>. </p>
			<p>In the next section, we're going to show you how to set up the development environment and get hands- on, writing a TableGen backend.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Writing the TableGen backend</h2>
			<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker139"/>section, we're showing you the steps of writing a backend to print out recipes written in TableGen. Let's start with the setup.</p>
			<h3>Project setup</h3>
			<p>To get started, LLVM has already provided a skeleton for writing a TableGen backend. So, please <a id="_idIndexMarker140"/>copy the <code>llvm/lib/TableGen/TableGenBackendSkeleton.cpp</code> file from the LLVM Project's source tree into the <code>llvm/utils/TableGen</code> folder, as follows:</p>
			<pre>$ cd llvm
$ cp lib/TableGen/TableGenBackendSkeleton.cpp \
     utils/TableGen/RecipePrinter.cpp</pre>
			<p>Then, refactor the c<code>SkeletonEmitter</code> class into <code>RecipePrinter</code>.</p>
			<p><code>RecipePrinter</code> has the following workflow:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Collect all baking steps and ingredient records.</li>
				<li>Print individual ingredients in textual formats using individual functions to print measuring units, temperature, equipment, and so on in textual formats.</li>
				<li>Linearize the DAG of all baking steps.</li>
				<li>Print each linearized baking step using a function to print custom formatting.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We're not going to cover all the implementation details since lots of backend codes are actually not directly related to TableGen (text formatting and string processing, for example). Therefore, the following subsections only focus on how to retrieve information from TableGen's in-memory objects.</p>
			<h3>Getting all the baking steps</h3>
			<p>In the TableGen backend, a TableGen record is represented by the <code>Record</code> C++ class. When we <a id="_idIndexMarker141"/>want to retrieve all the records derived from a specific TableGen <code>class</code>, we can use one of the functions of <code>RecordKeeper</code>: <code>getAllDerivedDefinitions</code>. For instance, let's say we want to fetch all the baking steps records that derived from the <code>Step</code> TableGen class in this case. Here is how we do with <code>getAllDerivedDefinitions</code>:</p>
			<pre>// In RecipePrinter::run method…
<strong class="bold">std::vector&lt;Record*&gt; Steps</strong> = Records.<strong class="bold">getAllDerivedDefinitions</strong>("Step");</pre>
			<p>This gives <a id="_idIndexMarker142"/>us a list of <code>Record</code> pointers that represent all of the <code>Step</code> records.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">For the rest of this section, we will use <code>Record</code> in this format (with Courier font face) to refer to the C++ counterpart of a TableGen record. </p>
			<h3>Retrieving field values</h3>
			<p>Retrieving field <a id="_idIndexMarker143"/>values from <code>Record</code> is probably the most basic operation. Let's say we're working on a method for printing <code>Unit</code> record objects introduced earlier, as follows:</p>
			<pre>void RecipePrinter::printUnit(raw_ostream&amp; OS, Record* UnitRecord) {
  OS &lt;&lt; UnitRecord-&gt;<strong class="bold">getValueAsString("Text")</strong>;
}</pre>
			<p>The <code>Record</code> class provides some handy functions, such as <code>getValueAsString</code>, to retrieve the value of a field and try to convert it into a specific type so that you don't need to retrieve the <code>RecordVal</code> value of a specific field (in this case, the <code>Text</code> field) before getting the real value. Similar functions include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>Record* getValueAsDef(StringRef FieldName)</code></li>
				<li><code>bool getValueAsBit(StringRef FieldName)</code></li>
				<li><code>int64_t getValueAsInt(StringRef FieldName)</code></li>
				<li><code>DagInit* getValueAsDag(StringRef FieldName)</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition to these utility functions, we sometimes just want to check if a specific field exists in a record. In such cases, call <code>Record::getValue(StringRef FieldName)</code> and check if the returned value is null. But just be aware that not every field <em class="italic">needs</em> to be initialized; you may still need to check if a field exists, but is uninitialized. When that happens, let <code>Record::isValueUnset</code> help you.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">TableGen actually uses a special <code>Init</code> class, <code>UnsetInit</code>, to represent an uninitialized value.</p>
			<h3>Type conversion</h3>
			<p><code>Init</code> represents <a id="_idIndexMarker144"/>initialization values, but most of the time we're not directly working with it but with one of its children's classes. </p>
			<p>For example, <code>StepOrIngredient</code> is an <code>Init</code> type object that represents either a <code>Step</code> record or an ingredient record. It would be easier for us to convert it to its underlying <code>DefInit</code> object since <code>DefInit</code> provides richer functionalities. We can use the following code to typecast the <code>Init</code> type <code>StepOrIngredient</code> into a <code>DefInit</code> type object: </p>
			<pre>const auto* SIDef = <strong class="bold">cast&lt;const DefInit&gt;(StepOrIngredient)</strong>;</pre>
			<p>You can also use <code>isa&lt;…&gt;(…)</code> to check its underlying type first, or <code>dyn_cast&lt;…&gt;(…)</code> if you don't want to receive an exception when the conversion fails.</p>
			<p><code>Record</code> represents a TableGen record, but it would be better if we can find out its parent class, which further tells us the field's information.</p>
			<p>For example, after getting the underlying <code>Record</code> object for <code>SIDef</code>, we can use the <code>isSubClassOf</code> function to tell if that <code>Record</code> is a baking step or ingredient, as follows:</p>
			<pre>Record* SIRecord = SIDef-&gt;getDef();
if (SIRecord-&gt;<strong class="bold">isSubClassOf("Step")</strong>) {
  // This Record is a baking step!
} else if (SIRecord-&gt;<strong class="bold">isSubClassOf("IngredientBase")</strong>){
  // This Record is an ingredient!
} </pre>
			<p>Knowing what the underlying TableGen class actually is can help us to print that record in its own way.</p>
			<h3>Handling DAG values</h3>
			<p>Now, we are going to print out the <code>Step</code> records. Recall that we used the <code>dag</code> type to represent <a id="_idIndexMarker145"/>the action and the ingredients required for a baking step. Have a look at the following code example:</p>
			<pre>def step_prep : Step&lt;<strong class="bold">(heat:$action fry_oil:$oil, oil_temp:$temp)</strong>&gt; {
  let CustomFormat = "$action $oil until $temp";
}</pre>
			<p>Here, the highlighted <code>dag</code> is stored in the <code>Action</code> field of the <code>Step</code> TableGen class. So, we use <code>getValueAsDag</code> to retrieve that field as a <code>DagInit</code> object, as follows:</p>
			<pre>DagInit* DAG = StepRecord-&gt;<strong class="bold">getValueAsDag("Action");</strong></pre>
			<p><code>DagInit</code> is just another class derived from <code>Init</code>, which wasintroduced earlier. It contains some DAG-specific APIs. For example, we can iterate through all of its operands and get their associated <code>Init</code> object using the <code>getArg</code> function, as follows:</p>
			<pre>for(i = 0; i &lt; DAG-&gt;arg_size; ++i) {
  Init* Arg = DAG-&gt;<strong class="bold">getArg</strong>(i);
}</pre>
			<p>Furthermore, we can use the <code>getArgNameStr</code> function to retrieve the token (if there is any), which is always represented in string type in the TableGen backend, associated with a specific operand, as illustrated in the following code snippet:</p>
			<pre>for(i = 0; i &lt; DAG-&gt;arg_size; ++i) {
  StringRef ArgTok = DAG-&gt;<strong class="bold">getArgNameStr</strong>(i);
}</pre>
			<p>If <code>ArgTok</code> is empty, this means there is no token associated with that operand. To get the token associated with the operator, we can use the <code>getNameStr</code> API.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Both <code>DagInit::getArgNameStr</code> and <code>DagInit::getNameStr</code> return the token string <em class="italic">without</em> the leading dollar sign.</p>
			<p>This section has shown you some of the most important aspects of working with TableGen <a id="_idIndexMarker146"/>directives' in-memory C++ representation, which is the building block of writing a TableGen backend. In the next section, we will show you the final step to put everything together and run our custom TableGen backend.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Integrating the RecipePrinter TableGen backend</h2>
			<p>After finishing the <code>utils/TableGen/RecipePrinter.cpp</code> file, it's time to put everything together.</p>
			<p>As mentioned before, a TableGen backend is always associated with the <code>llvm-tblgen</code> tool, which <a id="_idIndexMarker147"/>is also the only interface to use the backend. <code>llvm-tblgen</code> uses simple command-line options to choose a backend to use. </p>
			<p>Here is an example of choosing one of the backends, <code>IntrInfoEmitter</code>, to generate a C/C++ header file from a <code>TableGen</code> file that carries instruction set information of <code>X86</code>:</p>
			<pre>$ llvm-tblgen -gen-instr-info /path/to/X86.td -o GenX86InstrInfo.inc</pre>
			<p>Let's now see how to integrate <code>RecipePrinter</code> source file to <code>TableGen</code> backend:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">To link the <code>RecipePrinter</code> source file into <code>llvm-tblgen</code> and add a command-line option to select it, we're going to use <code>utils/TableGen/TableGenBackends.h</code> first. This file only contains a list of TableGen backend entry functions, which are functions that take a <code>raw_ostream</code> output stream and the <code>RecordKeeper</code> object as arguments. We're also putting our <code>EmitRecipe</code> function into the list, as follows:<pre>…
void EmitX86FoldTables(RecordKeeper &amp;RK, raw_ostream &amp;OS);
<strong class="bold">void EmitRecipe(RecordKeeper &amp;RK, raw_ostream &amp;OS);</strong>
void EmitRegisterBank(RecordKeeper &amp;RK, raw_ostream &amp;OS);
…</pre></li>
				<li>Next, inside <code>llvm/utils/TableGen/TableGen.cpp</code>, we're first adding a new <code>ActionType</code> enum element and the selected command-line option, as follows:<pre>enum Action Type {
…
  <strong class="bold">GenRecipe</strong>,
…
}
…
cl::opt&lt;ActionType&gt; Action(
    cl::desc("Action to perform:"),
    cl::values(
        …
        <strong class="bold">clEnumValN(GenRecipe, "gen-recipe",</strong>
<strong class="bold">                   "Print delicious recipes")</strong>,
        …
    ));</pre></li>
				<li>After <a id="_idIndexMarker148"/>that, go to the <code>LLVMTableGenMain</code> function and insert the function call to <code>EmitRecipe</code>, as follows:<pre>bool LLVMTableGenMain(raw_ostream &amp;OS, RecordKeeper &amp;Records) {
  switch (Action) {
  …
  case <strong class="bold">GenRecipe</strong>:
    <strong class="bold">EmitRecipe(Records, OS)</strong>;
    break;
  }
}</pre></li>
				<li>Finally, don't forget to update <code>utils/TableGen/CMakeLists.txt</code>, as follows:<pre>add_tablegen(llvm-tblgen LLVM
  …
  <strong class="bold">RecipePrinter.cpp</strong>
  …)</pre></li>
				<li>That's all there is to it! You can now run the following command:<pre><code>-o</code> option.)</p><p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker149"/>preceding command will print out a (mostly) normal donut recipe, just like this:</p><pre><strong class="bold">=======Ingredients=======</strong>
<strong class="bold">1. oil 500 ml</strong>
<strong class="bold">2. flour 300 g</strong>
<strong class="bold">3. milk 1.25 cup</strong>
<strong class="bold">4. whole egg 1</strong>
<strong class="bold">5. yeast 1.50 tsp</strong>
<strong class="bold">6. butter 3.50 tbsp</strong>
<strong class="bold">7. sugar 2.0 tbsp</strong>
<strong class="bold">8. salt 0.50 tsp</strong>
<strong class="bold">9. vanilla extract 1.0 tsp</strong>
<strong class="bold">=======Instructions=======</strong>
<strong class="bold">1. use deep fryer to heat oil until 160 C</strong>
<strong class="bold">2. use mixer to mix flour, milk, whole egg, yeast, butter, sugar, salt, and vanilla extract. stir in low speed.</strong>
<strong class="bold">3. use mixer to mix outcome from (step 2). stir in medium speed.</strong>
<strong class="bold">4. use bowl to ferment outcome from (step 3).</strong>
<strong class="bold">5. use rolling pin to flatten outcome from (step 4).</strong>
<strong class="bold">6. use cutter to cut outcome from (step 5).</strong>
<strong class="bold">7. use deep fryer to fry outcome from (step 1) and outcome from (step 6).</strong></pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this section, we have learned how to build a custom TableGen backend to transform a recipe written in TableGen into normal plaintext format. Things we learned here include how <code>llvm-tblgen</code>, the driver of translating TableGen code, works; how to use the TableGen backend's C++ APIs to operate TableGen directive's in-memory representation; and how <a id="_idIndexMarker150"/>to integrate our custom backend into <code>llvm-tblgen</code> in order to run it. Combining the skills you learned in this chapter and in the previous one, you can create a complete and standalone toolchain that implements your custom logic, using TableGen as a solution.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we introduced TableGen, a powerful DSL for expressing structural data. We have shown you its universality in solving a variety of tasks, albeit it originally being created for compiler development. Through the lens of writing a donut recipe in TableGen, we have learned its core syntax. The following section on developing a custom TableGen backend taught you how to use C++ APIs to interact with in-memory TableGen directives parsed from the source input, giving you the power to create a complete and standalone TableGen toolchain to implement your own custom logic. Learning how to master TableGen can not only help your development in LLVM-related projects but also gives you more options to solve structural data problems in arbitrary projects.</p>
			<p>This section marks the end of the first part—an introduction to all kinds of useful supporting components in the LLVM project. Starting from the next chapter, we will move into the core compilation pipeline of LLVM. The first important topic we will cover is Clang, LLVM's official frontend for C-family programming languages.</p>
