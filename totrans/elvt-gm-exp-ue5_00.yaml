- en: Immerse yourself in Unreal game projects with this book, written by four highly
    experienced industry professionals with many years of combined experience with
    Unreal Engine. *Elevating Game Experiences with Unreal Engine 5* will walk you
    through the latest version of Unreal Engine by helping you get hands-on with the
    game creation projects.The book starts with an introduction to the Unreal Editor
    and key concepts such as actors, blueprints, animations, inheritance, and player
    input. You’ll then move on to the first of three projects – building a dodgeball
    game, where you’ll learn the concepts of line traces, collisions, projectiles,
    user interface, and sound effects. You’ll also discover how to combine these concepts
    to showcase your new skills. The second project, a side-scroller game, will help
    you implement concepts such as animation blending, enemy AI, spawning objects,
    and collectibles. And finally, you’ll cover the key concepts in creating a multiplayer
    environment as you work on the third project – an FPS game. By the end of the
    Unreal Engine book, you’ll have a broad understanding of how to use the tools
    that the game engine provides to start building your own games.

- en: This book is for game developers looking to get started with using Unreal Engine
    5 for their game development projects. Anyone who has used Unreal Engine before
    and wants to consolidate, improve, and apply their skills will find this book
    useful. To better grasp the concepts explained in this book, prior knowledge of
    C++ basics (such as variables, functions, classes, polymorphism, and pointers)
    is required. For full compatibility with the IDE used in this book, a Windows
    system is recommended.
