- en: The most commonly used components in RTOSes will be covered in this section.
    You'll use the knowledge gained from the first section and put it to work through
    hands-on examples with real hardware. You'll learn how to get the scheduler up
    and running and how to create tasks, queues, semaphores, mutexes, and more.  To
    get the most out of this section, make sure to have your development board, IDE,
    and debug toolchains ready to go before digging in!
