    as Unreal Engine, Unity, or Godot. You would play around with models and animations,
    levels, assets, menus, and other objects. By working your way through tutorials
    and videos, you would learn how to build a world similar to the game you love
    and be happy with what you have achieved.

    several features, remains? Even after moving from visual programming to the underlying
    programming languages of the 3D engine, you are still not satisfied. The complexity
    of the code is way too heavy to learn just the basics from it. So, you are again
    on the road, searching for answers to those questions...

- en: Does that sound familiar to you? Many game programmers start off with this kind
    of curiosity, a will to look “under the hood” of the things they see, and an urge
    to understand how models are animated and animations are blended. This might be
    how facial animations work or a simple “nodding” of the head is done, or how to
    make characters walk and run on the ground polygons of the level but not clip
    through walls.

- en: This book aims to answer your questions about the implementation details of
    3D game character animations. You will start off with nothing more than a basic
    OpenGL or Vulkan renderer to draw triangles to the screen – and then you will
    be guided all the way up the hill, from loading a single character model from
    a file to multiple instances of different models roaming around a game map, detecting
    and avoiding walls and other instances in the virtual world, following predefined
    paths, and being able to interact with another instance.

    an overview of the data structures of **Open Asset Import Library** (or **assimp**)
    and explains how to load a character model from a file. The fileloading process
    will be enhanced by adding an ImGui-based **Open File** dialog. In addition, code

    and store lookup data in GPU memory. By using the massively parallel architecture
    of the GPU, computing the node positions of all instances will be accelerated,
    and the CPU will be free again for other tasks.'

    and sources to learn more about these features are included in the chapters of
    their first usage. But you should be able to debug simple C++ problems by yourself
