    been in a closed environment. By closed environment, we mean that our project
    simply received information or direction from a remote control and no information
    was transmitted out from the project. There are numerous use cases where we need
    to transmit information from our Arduino project to an external device such as
    a smartphone or other IoT device. When there is a need such as this, one of the
    first technologies that is brought up is **Bluetooth Low Energy**, also known
    as **Bluetooth LE** or Bluetooth Smart.

    not familiar with the technology is that Bluetooth LE is a lightweight subset
    of **Bluetooth Classic**. This is not true, as Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth
    LE are two fundamentally different protocols with different design goals.

    including reliable Bluetooth LE stacks with the iOS and Android operating systems
    and developing easy-to-use-and-understand Bluetooth LE APIs for developers. This

    to 2.481 GHz. Of these channels, 37 are reserved for data and three are reserved
    for advertising. The reason for the multiple channels is Bluetooth LE uses frequency
    hopping to mitigate interference. The three advertising channels are used for
    discovery of devices. Once a device is discovered, the same channel is used to
    exchange initial connection parameters. Once the connection parameters have been
    exchanged, the regular data channels are used for communication.

- en: Bluetooth LE is designed to operate at low power, and the best way to avoid
    using power is to turn the radio off as often as possible and for as long as possible.
    For Bluetooth LE, this is achieved by sending short bursts of packets at a certain
    frequency, and in between those radio bursts, the radio is powered off. This is
    often referred to as **Racing to Idle**, since the radio is essentially sending
    out information as fast as it can and then shutting down for a short period of
    time.

    the application data throughput. In the previous chart, we saw that the Bluetooth
    LE radio has a maximum over-the-air data rate of 1 Mbit/s. However, we also listed
    the application data throughput as only 0.125 Mbit/s. This means that the radio
    can theoretically transfer 1 Mbit per second; however, with the limitations put
    on the radio to conserve power, we only have a maximum transfer rate of 0.125
    Mbit per second. In a real-world application, we will actually never see anything
    close to this data transfer rate.

    standards to understand why the data throughput is so low. To start off with,
    the Bluetooth LE specifications define that the connection interval, which is
    the time interval between two consecutive connection events (when the two devices
    exchange data), to be between 7.5 ms and 4 s. This means that if we set the connection
    interval to the shortest time possible (7.5 ms), we will have a maximum of 133
    connection events per second.

    as we mentioned earlier, even that number will never be reached because we generally
    will never max out the bytes per packet or have 133 connection events in one second.
    Devices themselves can add further limitations to the connection interval and
    data packets per connection. In the best case, we will generally see around 5-10
    KB per second for the data throughput. This means that we generally only want
    to use Bluetooth LE technology when we are exchanging short bursts of data and
    avoid it when we wish to exchange large amounts or even stream data.

    basic mode of operations required by all Bluetooth LE devices to ensure interoperability
    (Generic Access Profile and GATT) or profiles that are used for specific use cases
    (health device profile and proximity profile). In this chapter, we will not go
    into the specific use cases of these profiles; however, we do want to look at

    of two states. In the broadcasting topology, a device can be either the broadcaster
    (slave) or observer (master). If a connection between the two devices is established,
    then the devices become either a central (master) or peripheral (slave). We introduced
    the terms master and slave here to illustrate the states that the devices can
    be in. The following diagram shows the different states:'

    state when the device is reset. A slave device will then become an advertiser,
    where it is advertising specific data, letting any master device know that it
    is a connectable device and what services it offers. After the idle state, a master
    device will begin scanning for slaves that are advertising. When a master receives
    an advertisement, it will send a scan request to the advertiser, and the slave
    will respond back with a scan response. This is the device discovery process.
  prefs: []

    device, it will initiate a connection. When initiating the connection, the master
    will specify the connection parameters. Once the connection is made the devices
    will assume their roles as master and slave. With Bluetooth LE 4.0, the slave
    device can have only one master. Also, with Bluetooth LE 4.0, the devices can
    act as either a master or a slave but not both. With later revisions of the Bluetooth
    specifications, these limitations have been removed. I know we have mentioned
    that a couple of times so far in this book, but it is important to keep in mind

    to. The main consideration is power consumption and data throughput. As the throughput
    increases, the device will use more power. For example, if we lower the connection
    interval, thereby increasing the number of connection attempts per second, the
    power consumption of the device will increase because the radio will be on more
    of the time. By reducing the slave latency, once again the radio will be on more.
    Therefore, it will also increase the power consumption. When working with a Bluetooth
    LE radio, you need to balance the power consumption with the data throughput needs
    for your project. There is no magic ratio that will work for all types of devices;
    it is something you will need to look at on a project-by-project basis.

- en: The HM-10 is a Bluetooth 4.0 module that is based on the TI CC2530 or CC2541
    Bluetooth **SOC** (**System-on-Chip**). The HM-10 is a very popular Bluetooth
    4 module for the Arduino, mostly due to its cheap cost and ease of use. The HM-10
    provides a standard serial connection to the Bluetooth layer. This allows for
    a very straightforward interface; however, it does hide the actual Bluetooth LE
    layer.

    to the power rail on the breadboard, which is connected to the 5V power out on
    the Arduino. The **GND** pin on the Bluetooth module is connected to the ground
    rail on the breadboard, which is connected to the ground pin on the Arduino. The
    **RX** pin on the Bluetooth module is connected directly to the digital **pin
    10** on the Arduino.

    different. For this, we want to ensure that the voltage does not exceed 3.3V.
    Therefore, we use a simple voltage divider. A voltage divider is a simple circuit
    that will turn a larger voltage into a smaller one. For this, we use two resistors,
    a 1.1K and a 3.3K. These two resistors are connected in series, where one end
    of the 3.3K resistor is connected to ground, and one end of the 1.1K resistor
    is connected to digital **pin 11** on the Arduino. The **TX** pin is connected
    between the two resistors.

    than pins 0 and 1\. There may be limitations to this library if you are using
    a board other than the Uno. You can reference the documentation ([https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/softwareSerial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/softwareSerial))

    the serial monitor, we will write a carriage return and new line. In the section
    that reads from the Bluetooth module and writes to the serial monitor, we check
    to see whether the `addNewLine` Boolean variable is `true`, and if so, we write
    a carriage return and new line to the serial monitor before setting the `addNewLine`

    is Bluetooth mesh. All previous Bluetooth technologies relied on a one-to-one
    or a one-to-many connection where there was always one master/central device.
    Mesh technology allows Bluetooth devices to establish many-to-many connections,
    which enables large-scale device networks that do not rely on a central controller.
    The Bluetooth mesh technology is still in its infancy at the time we are writing
    this book. However, I believe it is the future of Bluetooth and is a technology
    worth keeping an eye on.

    features are optional and not required to be fully implemented. For example, a
    manufacturer may say that their device meets the Bluetooth 4.2 standard. However,
    IPv6/6LoWPAN may not be implemented in the device. A good example of this is the
    iPhone. My iPhone X is Bluetooth 5.0 compatible; however, it is not capable of
    running Bluetooth mesh or IPv6/6LoWPAN.

    smartphones have Bluetooth LE built in and the technology is easy to use. It is
    also a good technology to use when we wish to send short bursts of data from one
    device to another. If you wish to build a separate device, such as a remote control,
    to control your main device or stream a lot of data, then I would recommend a
    different Bluetooth technology that is known as Bluetooth Classic or Legacy, which
