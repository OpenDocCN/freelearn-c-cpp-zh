    in C++. Though it is assumed that you have some prior experience with indirect
    addressing, we will start at the beginning. Pointers are a ground-level and pervasive
    feature of the language – one you must thoroughly understand and be able to utilize
    with ease. Many other languages use indirect addressing through references alone;
    however, in C++ you must roll up your sleeves and understand how to use and return
    heap memory correctly and effectively with pointers. You will see pointers heavily
    used throughout code from other programmers; there is no sensible way to ignore
    their use. Misusing pointers can create the most difficult errors to find in a
    program. A thorough understanding of indirect addressing using pointers is a necessity
    in C++ to create successful and maintainable code.

    as well as understand basic memory management for releasing memory when it is
    no longer needed in your applications, to avoid memory leakage. You will be able

    how and why to combine the const qualification with pointers – to the data, to
    the pointer itself, or to both. You will additionally understand how to declare

    situations in which they may prove useful. Lastly, you will preview the concept
    of a smart pointer to alleviate potential pointer conundrums and usage errors.

    At runtime, we can determine the quantity of a certain data type we may need (such
    as in a dynamically allocated array), organize data in data structures that facilitate
    sorting (such as in a linked list), or gain speed by passing an address of a large
    piece of data to a function (rather than passing a copy of the entire piece of
    data itself). Pointers have many uses, and we will see many examples throughout

    variable is one that may contain an address, and memory at that address may contain
    relevant data. It is typical to say that the pointer variable *points* to an address
    containing the relevant data. The value of the pointer variable itself is an address,
    not the data we are after. When we then go to that address, we find the data of
    interest. This is known as **indirect addressing**. To summarize, the content
    of a pointer variable is an address; if you then go to that address, you find
    the data. This is for a single level of indirection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A pointer variable may point to the existing memory of a non-pointer variable,
    or it may point to memory that is dynamically allocated on the heap. The latter
    case is the most usual situation. Unless a pointer variable is properly initialized
    or assigned a value, the content of the pointer variable is meaningless and does
    not represent a usable address. A large mistake can be assuming that a pointer
    variable has been properly initialized when it may not have been. Let us look
    at some basic operators that are useful with pointers. We will start with the
    address-of `&` and the dereference operator `*`.

    application starts, nor does C++ ensure that memory is conveniently empty, without
    values, when paired with a variable. The memory simply has in it what was previously
    stored there; C++ memory is not considered *clean*. Because memory is not given
    to a programmer *clean* in C++, the contents of a newly declared pointer variable,
    unless properly initialized or assigned a value, should not be construed to contain
    a valid address.

    address of an existing integer in memory, and we set our pointer variable to point

    the heap. A pointer variable may choose to point to memory that is dynamically
    allocated at runtime, rather than to point to another variable’s existing memory.
    This gives us flexibility as to when we want to allocate the memory, and how many
    pieces of such memory we may choose to have. Operator `delete()` can then be applied
    to a pointer variable to mark memory we no longer require, returning the memory
    to the heap management facility for later reuse in the application. It is important
    to understand that once we `delete()` a pointer variable, we should no longer
    use the address contained within that variable as a valid address.

    we dereference `y` and store the value of `17` in the memory location pointed
    to by `y`. After printing out the value of `*y`, we then decide that we are done
    with the memory `y` points to and return it to the heap management facility by

    either be that of an existing variable or newly allocated heap memory. Once the

    with a `nullptr` for safety. Then, we allocate heap memory for `item` to point
    to, using operator `new()`. Now, we assign values to the `x` and `y` members of
    `item`, respectively, using either the `->` operator or the `(*).` member access
    notation. In either case, the notation means to first dereference the pointer
    and then choose the appropriate data member. It’s pretty straightforward with
    the `(*).` notation – the parentheses show us that the pointer dereference happens
    first, and then the choice of the member happens next with the `.` (member selection)
    operator. The `->` shorthand notation indicates pointer dereference followed by
    member selection. After we use `cout` with the insertion operator `<<` to print
    the appropriate values, we decide that we no longer need the memory associated

    We also declare a pointer to an integer with `int *intArray;`, and a pointer to
    a `collection` using `collection *collectionArray;`. These declarations state

    a typical array notation of `[]` to access each element of the two arrays, even
    though the arrays have been dynamically allocated. Because `collectionArray` is
    a dynamically allocated array of user defined types, we must also use `.` notation

    the array. By adding `i` offsets to this address, you are now at the address of
    the `i`th element in this array. By dereferencing this composite address with
    `*`, you will now go to the proper address to retrieve the relevant integer data,
    which is then printed using `cout` and the insertion operator `<<`. Likewise,
    with `(*(collectionArray + i)).y`, we first add `i` to the starting address of
    `collectionArray`, then using `()`, we dereference that address with `*`. Since
    this is a user defined type, we must then use `.` to select the appropriate data
    member `y`.

    would suffice for the dynamically allocated array of standard types, we instead
    choose `delete [] intArray;` to be consistent with the required manner for deletion
    for dynamically allocated arrays of user defined types. That is, the more complex
    statement of `delete [] collectionArray;` is necessary for the proper deletion
    of an array of user defined types. In all cases, the memory associated with each
    dynamically allocated array will be returned to the free-list, and can then be
    reused when heap memory is again allocated with subsequent calls to operator `new()`.
    However, as we will later see, the `[]` used with `delete()` will allow for a
    special clean-up function to be applied to each array element of a user defined
    type before the memory is relinquished. Additionally, consistency is appreciated:
    if you allocate with `new()`, relinquish the memory with `delete()`; if you allocate
    with `new []`, then relinquish with `delete []`. This consistent pairing will
    also keep your program working as intended should any of these aforementioned

- en: Dynamically allocating both the row and column dimensions for an array can add
    necessary runtime flexibility to a program. To achieve this ultimate flexibility,
    a 2-D array can be modeled using a pointer to a pointer of the desired data type.
    Initially, the dimension representing the number of rows will be allocated. Next,
    for each row, the number of elements in each row will be allocated. As with the
    last example using an array of pointers, the number of elements in each row (the
    column entries) need not be uniform in size across rows. However, to accurately
    model the concept of a 2-D array, it is assumed that the column size will be allocated
    uniformly from row to row.

    number of pointers to model an N-D array. We can also see the pattern for the
    necessary allocations. Multidimensional arrays can become quite large, especially
    if you were forced to model them with the largest potentially necessary fixed-sized
    array. The beauty of modeling with pointers to pointers (to pointers, and so on)
    for each level of a necessary multi-dimensional array is that you can allocate
    exactly a size that may be determined at runtime. To make usage easy, array notation
    using `[]` can be used as an alternative to pointer notation to access the elements
    in the dynamically allocated array. C++ has a lot of flexibility stemming from
    pointers. Dynamically allocated arrays demonstrate one such flexibility.

    in the previous chapters illustrating function prototypes and function definitions.
    Now, let’s augment our understanding of functions by passing pointers as arguments
    to functions, and using pointers as return values from a function.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Passing pointers as arguments to functions
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Arguments passed from actual to formal parameters in a function call are by
    default copied on the stack. In order to modify the contents of a variable as
    an argument to a function, a pointer to that argument must instead be used as
    a function parameter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Any time an actual parameter is passed to a function in C++, a copy of something
    is made and passed on the stack to that function. For example, if an integer is
    passed as an actual parameter to a function, a copy of that integer is made and
    then passed on the stack to the function to be received as the formal parameter.
    Changing the formal parameter in the scope of the function would only change the
    copy of the data that was passed into the function.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Should we instead require the ability to modify a function’s parameters, it
    is then necessary that we pass a pointer to the desired data as a parameter to
    the function. In C++, passing a pointer as an actual parameter copies this address
    on the stack, and the copy of the address is received as the formal parameter
    in the function. However, using the copy of the address, we can still go to that
    address (by dereferencing that pointer) to access the desired data and make changes
    to the desired data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To reiterate, something is always copied on the stack when you pass a parameter
    in C++. If you pass a non-pointer variable, you get a copy of that data passed
    on the stack to the function. Changes made to that data in the scope of that function
    are local changes only and do not persist when the function returns. The local
    copy is simply popped off the stack at the conclusion of the function. However,
    if you pass a pointer to a function, though the address stored in the pointer
    variable is still copied on the stack and passed to the function, you can still
    dereference the copy of the pointer to access the real data at the desired address.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You always need to be one step back from that which you want to modify. If you
    want to change a standard data type, pass a pointer to that type. If you want
    to change the value of the pointer itself (the address), you must pass a pointer
    to that pointer as a parameter to the function. Remember, a copy of something
    is passed to the function on the stack. You cannot change that copy beyond the
    scope of the function. Pass the address of that which you want to change – you
    are still passing a copy of that address, but using it will get you to the real
    data.

    reserved for a return value from the function. Fortunately, that address refers
    to heap memory. The assignment `name = createName();` in `main()` will capture
    this address and copy it to be stored into the `name` variable, which is local

    this variable would have been popped off the stack and been unavailable for proper
    use – even if that address had been captured in a pointer variable within `main()`.

    The keyword `const` can be applied to the data pointed to, to the pointer itself,

    values in a program that may be meant to be initialized but never again modified.
    Let’s examine each of these various scenarios. We will also be combining `const`

    `constData` is the destination string, the compiler will issue an error.
  prefs: []

    can do anything if you try hard enough, so an explicit typecast here will work,
    but is purposely not shown. An explicit typecast will still generate a compiler
    warning to allow you to question whether this is truly something you intend to
    do. When we move forward with OO concepts, we will introduce ways to further protect
    data so that this type of circumvention can be eliminated.

    This means that when using the identifier `moreConstData`, this string may not
    be modified. However, using its own identifier, which is defined as `char *anotherRegularString;`,
    this string may be changed. This seems inconsistent, but it is not. The `const
    char *` variable chose to point to a `char *` – elevating its protection for a
    particular situation. If the `const char *` truly wanted to point to an immutable
    object, it would have chosen to instead point to another `const char *` variable.

    in the scope of the function in question. The same principle holds true for the
    return value from a function. Constant qualifying the data pointed to insists
    that the caller of the function must also store the return value in a pointer

    literal `"Group"` as the actual parameter, which is received as `const char *base`
    in the formal parameter list of the function definition. This means that when
    using the identifier `base`, this string may not be modified.

- en: Next, within `GenId()`, we declare local pointer variable `temp` on the stack
    and allocate enough heap memory for `temp` to point to, to accommodate the string
    pointed to by `base` plus an extra character for the suffix to be added, plus
    one for the null character to terminate the new string. Note that `strlen()` counts
    the number of characters in a string, excluding the null character. Now, by using
    `strcpy()`, `base` is copied into `temp`. Then, using the assignment `temp[strlen(base)]
    = suffix++;`, the letter stored in `suffix` is added to the string pointed to
    by `temp` (and `suffix` is incremented to the next letter for the next time we
    call this function). Remember that arrays are zero-based in C++ when adding characters
    to the end of a given string. For example, if `"Group"` comprises five characters
    in array `temp`’s positions 0 through 4, then the next character (from `suffix`)
    would be added at position 5 in `temp` (overwriting the current null character).
    In the next line of code, the null character is re-added to the end of the new
    string pointed to by `temp`, as all strings need to be null terminated. Note that,
    whereas `strcpy()` will automatically null-terminate a string, once you resort
    to a single-character replacement, such as by adding the suffix to the string,
    you then need to re-add the null character to the new overall string yourself.

- en: Lastly, in this function, `temp` is returned. Notice that though `temp` is declared
    as a `char *`, it is returned as a `const char *`. This means that the string
    will be treated in a more restrictive fashion upon its return to `main()` than
    it was treated in the body of the function. In essence, it has been upcast to
    a `const char *`. The implication is that since the return value of this function
    is a `const char *`, only a pointer of type `const char *` can capture the return
    value of this function. This is required so that the string cannot be treated
    in a less restrictive fashion than intended by the creator of function `GenId()`.
    Had `newId1` and `newId2` been declared of type `char *` rather than `const char
    *`, they would not have been allowed to serve as l-values to capture the return
    value of `GenId()`.

    Notice that the memory for these pointer variables was allocated and released

    to keep track of memory allocation and release in C++. Forgetting to deallocate
    memory can lead to memory leakage within an application.

    is, why must we always declare the type of data to which the pointer will eventually
    point, such as `int *ptr;`? C++ certainly does allow us to create pointers without
    associated types, but C++ then requires the programmer to keep track of things
    that would normally be done on their behalf. Nonetheless, we will see why void
    pointers are useful and what the programmer must undertake when using more generic
    void pointers in this section.

    misuse can be extremely dangerous. We will, much later in the book, see a safer
    alternative to genericize types (including pointers) in [*Chapter 13*](B19087_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor561),
    *Working with Templates*. Nonetheless, there are careful encapsulated techniques
    that use an underlying implementation of a `void *` for efficiency, paired with
    a safe wrapper of a template. We will see that templates are expanded for every
    type needed and can sometimes lead to *template bloat*. In these cases, a safe
    pairing of a template with an underlying `void *` implementation gives us both
    safety and efficiency.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To understand a void pointer, let us first consider why a type is typically
    associated with a pointer variable. Typically, declaring the type with the pointer
    gives C++ information about how to conduct pointer arithmetic or index into a
    dynamically allocated array of that pointer type. That is, if we have allocated
    `int *ptr = new int [10];`, we have 10 consecutive integers. Using either the
    array notation of `ptr[3] = 5;` or the pointer arithmetic of `*(ptr + 3) = 5;`
    to access one such element in this dynamically allocated set relies on the size
    of the data type `int` to internally allow C++ to understand how large each element
    is and how to move from one such item to the next. The data type also tells C++,
    once it has arrived at an appropriate memory address, how to interpret the memory.
    For example, an `int` and a `float` may have the same storage size on a given
    machine, however, the two’s complement memory layout of an `int` versus the mantissa,
    exponent layout of a `float` is quite different. C++’s knowledge of how to interpret
    the given memory is crucial, and the data type of the pointer does just that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the need still exists to have a more generic pointer. For example,
    you may want a pointer that might point to an integer in one situation, yet to
    a set of user defined types in another situation. Using a `void *` allows just
    this to happen. But what about type? What happens when you dereference a void
    pointer? If C++ does not know how many bytes to go from one element in a set to
    another, how can it index into a dynamically allocated array of void pointers?
    How will it interpret the bytes once at an address? What is the type?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The answer is that you, the programmer, must personally remember what you are
    pointing to at all times. Without the type associated with the pointer, the compiler
    cannot do this for you. And when it is time to dereference the void pointer, you
    will be in charge of correctly remembering the ultimate type involved and performing
    the appropriate type cast on that pointer.

    The void pointer may then point to an object of any type. Explicit casting must
    be used in order to dereference actual memory pointed to by the `void *`. Explicit
    casting must also be used in C++ to assign memory pointed to by a `void *` to
    a pointer variable of a known type. It is the programmer’s responsibility to ensure
    that the dereferenced data types are the same before making the assignment. Should
    the programmer be incorrect, there will be an elusive pointer mistake to find
    elsewhere in the code.

    must be done before `unspecified` may be dereferenced – otherwise, C++ does not
    understand how to interpret the memory that `unspecified` points to. Also note
    that if you accidentally typecast `unspecified` to the wrong type, the compiler
    would let you proceed, as typecasts are seen as a *“just do it”* command to the

    programs. However, we have also seen that with the power that pointers can provide
    comes potential havoc! Dereferencing uninitialized pointers can take us to non-existent
    memory locations that will inevitably crash our programs. Accidentally dereferencing
    memory that we have marked for deletion is similarly destructive – the memory
    address may have already been reused by the heap management facility elsewhere
    in our program. Neglecting to delete dynamically allocated memory when we are
    done with it will cause memory leaks. Even more challenging is allocating memory
    in one scope and expecting to remember to delete that memory in another scope.
    Or, consider what happens when two or more pointers point to the same piece of
    heap memory. Which pointer is responsible for deleting the memory? This is an
    issue we will see several times throughout the book with various solutions. These
    issues are just a few of the potential landmines we may step on when we utilize

    so you will need to understand their usage as well. Additionally, you may be integrating

    using both standard and user defined types. We have also understood why we may

    `N` dimensions. We have seen how to release the corresponding memory using `delete[]`.
    We have reviewed functions by adding pointers as parameters to functions and as
    return values from functions. We have also learned how to `const` qualify pointers
    as well as the data to which they point (or both) and why you may want to do so.
