- en: C++ does not add any bloat, extends maintainability, and offers many advantages
    over different programming languages, thus making it a good choice for embedded
    development. Do you want to build standalone or networked embedded systems and
    make them safety-critical and memory-safe? In this book, you will learn exactly
    how to do this. You will learn how C++ works and compares to other languages used
    for embedded development, how to create advanced GUIs for embedded devices in
    order to design an attractive and functional UI, and how to integrate proven strategies
    into your design for optimum hardware performance.

- en: '[Chapter 1](0ff8cac9-3155-45e1-af05-7005fc419dd6.xhtml), *What Are Embedded
    Systems?* makes you familiar with what an embedded system entails. By looking
    at the various categories and examples of embedded systems in each category, a
    good overview of what is meant with the term *embedded* and the wide variety within
    that term should be formed. It explores the wide range of historic and currently
    available microcontrollers and system-on-chip solutions you can find in existing
    systems as well as new designs.'

    Language*, explains why C++ is actually as nimble as C and similar languages.
    Not only is C++ generally at least as fast as C, there is no additional bloat,
    and it offers many advantages with code paradigms and maintainability.'

    Linux and Similar Systems*, explains how to develop for Linux-based embedded systems
    and kin on SBCs and manage the differences between Linux-based and PC-based development.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](bb67db6a-7c71-4519-80c3-7cd571cddfc0.xhtml), *Resource-Restricted
    Embedded Systems*, deals with planning for and using limited resources efficiently. We
    will take a look at how to select the right MCU for a new project and add peripherals
    and deal with Ethernet and serial interface requirements in a project. We will
    also look at an example AVR project, how to develop for other MCU architectures,
    and whether to use an RTOS.'

    Monitor with Wi-Fi*, explains how to create a Wi-Fi-enabled soil humidity monitor
    with actuator options for a pump or similar. Using the built-in web server, you
    can use its browser-based UI for monitoring and control, or integrate it into
    a larger system using its REST API.'

    used to develop for embedded systems. We will look at how it compares with other
    frameworks and how Qt is optimized for these embedded platforms, before working
    through an example of a QML-based GUI that can be added to the previously-created
    infotainment system.'
