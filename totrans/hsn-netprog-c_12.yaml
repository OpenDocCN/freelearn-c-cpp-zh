    using **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure** (**HTTPS**). HTTPS provides several
    benefits over HTTP. HTTPS gives an authentication method to identify servers and
    detect impostors. It also protects the privacy of all transmitted data and prevents
    interceptors from tampering with or forging transmitted data.

    this chapter also applies to SSL. Generally, establishing an HTTPS connection
    involves the client and server negotiating which protocol to use. The ideal outcome

    data as input, referred to as **plaintext**. The cipher produces encrypted data,

    is called encryption, and the act of reversing it back is called **decryption**.

    the sender and receiver. Generating and transmitting this key securely poses a
    problem. How can the key be sent between parties if they don't already have a
    secure communication channel? If they do already have a secure communication channel,
    why is encryption needed in the first place?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Key exchange algorithms attempt to address these problems. Key exchange algorithms
    work by allowing both communicating parties to generate the same secret key. In
    general, the parties first agree on a public, non-secret key. Then, each party
    generates its own secret key and combines it with the public key. These combined
    keys are exchanged. Each party then adds its own secret to the combined keys to
    arrive at a combined, secret key. This combined, secret key is then known to both
    parties, but not derivable by an eavesdropper.

    channel. However, in practice, modern asymmetric ciphers are inefficient and only
    able to protect small amounts of data. For this reason, symmetric ciphers are
    preferred whenever possible. TLS uses asymmetric ciphers only to authenticate
    the server. TLS uses a key exchange algorithm and symmetric ciphers to protect
    the actual communication.

    imperative that TLS connections are able to select the best algorithms that are

    certificate must either be trusted by the client itself or trusted by a third
    party that the client trusts. In common usages, such as web browsers, it's not
    really possible to list all trusted certificates. For this reason, it's most common
    to validate certificates by verifying that a trusted third party trusts them.
    This trust is proven using digital signatures.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, a popular digital certificate authority is DigiCert Inc. Suppose
    that you trust DigiCert Inc. and have stored a certificate from them locally;
    you then connect to a website, `example.com`. You may not trust `example.com`,
    because you haven't seen their certificate before. However, `example.com` shows
    you that their certificate has been digitally signed by the DigiCert Inc. certificate
    you do trust. Therefore, you trust `example.com` website's certificate too.

    authorities are careful to avoid this, as it would ruin their reputation.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many servers host multiple domains. Certificates are tied to domains; therefore,
    TLS must provide a method for the client to specify which domain it's connecting
    to. You may recall that the HTTP *Host* header servers this purpose. The problem
    is that the TLS connection should be established before the HTTP data is sent.
    Therefore, the server must decide which certificate to transmit before the HTTP
    *Host* header is received.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is accomplished using **Server Name Indication** (**SNI**). SNI is a technique
    that, when used by TLS, requires the client to indicate to the server which domain
    it is attempting to connect to. The server can then find a matching certificate
    to use for the TLS connection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SNI is relatively new, and older browsers and servers do not support it. Before
    SNI was popular, servers had two choices—they could either host only one domain
    per IP address, or they could send certificates for all hosted domains for each
    connection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It should be noted that SNI involves sending the unencrypted domain name over
    the network. This means an eavesdropper can see which host the client is connecting
    to, even though they wouldn't know which resources the client is requesting from
    that host. Newer protocols, such as **encrypted server name identification** (**ESNI**),
    address this problem but are not widely deployed yet.

- en: Once OpenSSL is initialized, we are ready to create an SSL context. This is
    done by calling the `SSL_CTX_new()` function, which returns an `SSL_CTX` object.
    You can think of this object as a sort of factory for SSL/TLS connections. It
    holds the initial settings that you want to use for your connections. Most programs
    only need to create one `SSL_CTX` object, and they can reuse it for all their
    connections.
