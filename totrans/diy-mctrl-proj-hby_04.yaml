    It is important to understand first what sensors are and what their purpose is

- en: A **sensor** is an electronic component, device, or module that measures physical
    input from an environment or a particular situation (for example, a sensor measuring
    water temperature in a fish tank). Sensors are useful for detecting changes in
    physical variables, such as humidity, temperature, light, vibrations, and movement,
    among others. Those physical variations are manifested in the sensors by changing
    their electric/electronic properties, such as changes in resistance and conductivity
    in the sensors.

- en: There are different types of sensors with different applications. For example,
    motion sensors can detect human or pet movements when they pass across the sensor's
    field of view. If this sensor detects motion, it sends a signal to a computer
    or microcontroller board and then the board should do something about it, such
    as open an automatic door, set off an alarm, turn on a lightbulb, and so on. Other
    types of sensors include infrared, ultrasonic, temperature, pressure, and touch
    sensors.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A sensor can be part of a small electronic circuit called a **sensor module**.
    It contains other electronic components besides a sensor, such as resistors, transistors,
    LEDs, and integrated circuits, among others. The purpose of those extra components
    in a sensor module is to support and facilitate the reading, analysis, and transmission
    of signals coming from a sensor. Some sensor modules convert analog to digital
    data. Analog data are voltage variations, that is, analog to physical variables
    from an environment. For example, 0.5 volts obtained from a temperature sensor
    could be equivalent to 25 degrees Celsius. Digital data coming from a sensor module
    can contain either logical-level *HIGH* or logical-level *LOW* values.

    changing its resistance according to the amount of visible light that it detects.
    There are different types of photoresistors. Some of them detect **ultraviolet**
    (**UV**) light and others detect infrared light. The latter is used in TV sets,
    where its infrared light sensor receives data from a remote control. *Figure 4.2*
    shows a common photoresistor used in the examples of this chapter. The photoresistor
    used in this chapter detects regular light that humans can see. It does not detect

    to a **Ground** pin from a microcontroller board and the other pin is connected
    to a voltage pin (**Vcc**) and an **Input port** from a microcontroller board.
    That is one way to connect a photoresistor. The **10K ohm** resistor works as
    a pull-down resistor. This is because the input port where the photoresistor is
    connected to at some point will receive zero volts when the photoresistor is not
    receiving any light. Remember that we should not leave an input pin without connecting
    to anything, otherwise its state will be floating (inputting random voltages).

    *Figure 4.7* to get analog values from the photoresistor sensor module shown in
    *Figure 4.9*. You may need to adjust the values in the code if necessary. You
    can experiment with a number of environments (for example, using the sensor in
    a living room or a bedroom) to see the analog values obtained by the microcontroller
    board from the sensor change and thus adjust the code accordingly.

    OK. First of all, remember that the photoresistor used in this chapter does not
    have polarity, so you can safely connect any of its pins (legs) to a microcontroller
    board's input port.

- en: You also need to make sure that the pull-down resistor connected to the photoresistor
    has the right value. For example, the pull-down resistor used in the Blue Pill
    example from *Figure 4.4* is 10K ohm, and we used a 220-ohm resistor for the Curiosity
    Nano example from *Figure 4.6*. We found those resistor values experimentally.
    You can try out different resistors connected to the photoresistor to see if the
    voltage passing through the photoresistor changes widely. Ideally, that voltage
    should be changing between 0 and 3.3 volts, or close to those values, because
    in our circuit examples from this chapter, we connected one pin of the photoresistor
    to 3.3 volts.
