    <h1 id="_idParaDest-14" class="partTitle">Populating the World with the Game Character Models</h1>
    <p class="normal">The first part of the book starts with an introduction to <strong class="keyWord">Assimp</strong>, the Open Asset Import Library. You will learn how to load a character model from a file, how to process the different elements of the character, such as meshes, textures, and nodes, and how to draw the model to the screen. You will also learn how to move the computational load to the GPU by using compute shaders, freeing the CPU for features introduced in the book. Finally, you will explore the idea and implementation of a visual selection, enabling you to select a model instance on the screen with a click of the mouse.</p>
