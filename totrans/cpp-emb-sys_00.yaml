- en: C++ is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language, supporting procedural,
    object-oriented, and, to some extent, functional programming paradigms. It started
    out as C with classes, but over time it transformed into a modern language that
    enables writing highly expressive code without sacrificing performance. Despite
    this, C remains the dominant language in embedded development, primarily due to
    its simplicity and gentler learning curve.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the simplicity of C often makes writing complex systems overly verbose,
    increasing the cognitive burden on developers and making code more error-prone.
    This is where C++ excels. With features such as generic programming, runtime and
    compile-time polymorphism, compile-time computation, and enhanced type and memory
    safety, it is a superb choice for embedded system development.

- en: Myths about C++, such as code bloat and runtime overhead, are still widespread.
    This book begins by debunking these misconceptions and guiding you through C++
    fundamentals. It then shifts focus to more advanced modern C++ concepts, applying
    them to solve real-world problems in embedded development.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The goal of this book is to show you how modern C++ can be effectively used
    in embedded systems through carefully selected examples and by applying good software
    development practices.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for embedded developers who mainly use C in their daily jobs and
    would like to discover modern C++. Some familiarity with C++ is expected but not
    necessary, as the book also covers C++ basics.
