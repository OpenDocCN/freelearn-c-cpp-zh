<p class="mce-root">As a leading cross-platform toolkit for all significant desktop, mobile, and embedded platforms, Qt is becoming more popular by the day. This book will help you learn the nitty-gritty of Qt and will equip you with the necessary toolsets to build apps and games. This book is designed as a beginner's guide to take programmers new to Qt from the basics, such as objects, core classes, widgets, and new features in version 5.9, to a level where they can create a custom application with the best practices of programming with Qt.</p>
<p class="mce-root">From a brief introduction of how to create an application and prepare a working environment for both desktop and mobile platforms, we will dive deeper into the basics of creating graphical interfaces and Qt's core concepts of data processing and display. As you progress through the chapters, you'll learn to enrich your games by implementing network connectivity and employing scripting. Delve into Qt Quick, OpenGL, and various other tools to add game logic, design animation, add game physics, handle gamepad input, and build astonishing UIs for games. Toward the end of this book, you'll learn to exploit mobile device features, such as sensors and geolocation services, to build engaging user experiences.</p>

<p>This book will be interesting and helpful to programmers and application and UI developers who have basic knowledge of C++. Additionally, some parts of Qt allow you to use JavaScript, so basic knowledge of this language will also be helpful. No previous experience with Qt is required. Developers with up to a year of Qt experience will also benefit from the topics covered in this book.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">To get the most out of this book</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You don't need to own or install any particular software before starting to work with the book. A common Windows, Linux, or MacOS system should be sufficient. <a href="d129202d-f982-4114-b69a-094d0a136fe9.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Installation</em>, contains detailed instructions on how to download and set up everything you'll need.</p>
<p>In this book, you will find several headings that appear frequently:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Time for action</strong> section contains clear instructions on how to complete a procedure or task.</li>
<li>The <strong>What just happened?</strong> section explains the working of the tasks or instructions that you have just completed.</li>
<li>The <strong>Have a go hero</strong> sections contain practical challenges that give you ideas to experiment with what you have learned.</li>
<li>The <strong>Pop quiz</strong> sections contain short single-choice questions intended to help you test your own understanding. You will find the answers at the end of the book.</li>
</ul>
<p>While going through the chapters, you will be presented with multiple games and other projects as well as detailed descriptions of how to create them. We advise you to try to create these projects yourself using the instructions we'll give you. If at any point of time you have trouble following the instructions or don't know how to do a certain step, you should take a pick at the example code files to see how it can be done. However, the most important and exciting part of learning is to decide what you want to implement and then find a way to do it, so pay attention to the "Have a go hero" sections or think of your own way to improve each project.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: "This API is centered on <kbd>QNetworkAccessManager</kbd>,which handles the complete communication between your game and the Internet."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>QNetworkRequest request;<br/>request.setUrl(QUrl("http://localhost/version.txt"));<br/>request.setHeader(QNetworkRequest::UserAgentHeader, "MyGame");<br/>m_manager-&gt;get(request);</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>void FileDownload::downloadFinished(QNetworkReply *reply) {<br/>    <strong>const QByteArray content = reply-&gt;readAll();</strong><br/>    _edit-&gt;setPlainText(content);<br/>    <strong>reply-&gt;deleteLater();</strong><br/>}</pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "On the Select Destination Location screen, click on Next to accept the default destination."</p>
