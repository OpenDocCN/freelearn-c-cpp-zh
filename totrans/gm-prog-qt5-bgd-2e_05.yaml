    View framework. With that knowledge, we can now proceed to implementing our first
    2D game. Down the road, we will learn more about Qt's property system, explore
    multiple ways of performing animations, and add gamepad support to our application.
    By the end of the chapter, you will know all the most useful features of Graphics
    View.

    how to position them on the scene, and of how to set up the view to show the scene,
    you can make pretty awesome things. You can even zoom and move the scene with
    the mouse. That's surely good, but for a game, one crucial point is still missing—you

    will become more complex than our previous projects, we will not be giving you
    precise instructions for editing the code. If at any time you are unsure about
    the changes you make, you can look at the reference implementation provided with
    the book. It also contains the image files you can use to implement the game.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Let''s now look at how we can mobilize Benjamin. First, we need a custom item
    class for him. We call the `Player` class and choose `QGraphicsPixmapItem` as
    the base class, because Benjamin is a PNG image. In the item''s `Player` class,
    we further create a private field of integer type and call it `m_direction`. Its
    value signifies in which direction Benjamin walks—left or right—or if he stands
    still. Next, we implement the constructor:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE0]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: In the constructor, we set `m_direction` to `0`, which means that Benjamin isn't
    moving at all. If `m_direction` is `1`, Benjamin moves right, and if the value
    is `-1`, he moves left. In the body of the constructor, we set the image for the
    item by calling `setPixmap()`. The image of Benjamin is stored in the Qt Resource
    system; thus, we access it through `QPixmap(":/elephant")`, with elephant as the
    given alias for the actual image of Benjamin. Finally, we use the `setOffset()`
    function to change how the pixmap is positioned in the item's coordinate system.
    By default, the origin point corresponds to the top-left corner of the pixmap,
    but we prefer to have it at the center of the pixmap so that applying transformations
    is easier.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you are unsure of how to specify the path to your resource, you can ask
    Qt Creator about it. To do that, expand the Resources branch in the project tree,
    locate the resource, and select the Copy Path... entry in its context menu.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE1]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: The `direction()` function is a standard getter function for `m_direction` returning
    its value. The `setDirection()` setter function additionally checks in which direction
    Benjamin is moving. If he is moving left, we need to flip his image so that Benjamin
    looks to the left, the direction in which he is moving. If he is moving toward
    the right, we restore the normal state by assigning an empty `QTransform` object,
    which is an identity matrix.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We cannot use `QGraphicsItem::setScale` here, because it only supports the same
    scale factors for *x* and *y* axes. Fortunately, `setTransform()` enables us to
    set any affine or perspective transformation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, we now have our item of the `Player` class for the game's character, which
    shows the image of Benjamin. The item also stores the current moving direction,
    and based on that information, the image is flipped vertically if needed.

    name the new class `MyScene`. There, we implement one part of the game logic.
    This is convenient since `QGraphicsScene` inherits `QObject` and thus we can use
    Qt's signal and slot mechanism.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The scene creates the  environment in which our elephant will be walking and
    jumping. Overall, we have a view fixed in size holding a scene, which is exactly
    as big as the view. We do not take size changes of the view into account, since
    they will complicate the example too much.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All animations inside the playing field are done by moving the items, not the
    scene. So we have to distinguish between the view's, or rather the scene's, width
    and the width of the elephant's virtual "world" in which he can move. In order
    to handle the movement properly, we need to create a few private fields in the `MyScene`
    class.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The width of this virtual world is defined by the `int m_fieldWidth` field and
    has no (direct) correlation with the scene. Within the range of `m_fieldWidth`,
    which is 500 pixels in the example, Benjamin or the graphics item can be moved
    from the minimum *x* coordinate, defined by `qreal m_minX`, to the maximum x coordinate,
    defined by `qreal m_maxX`. We keep track of his actual *x* position with the `qreal
    m_currentX` variable. Next, the minimum *y* coordinate the item is allowed to
    have is defined by `qreal m_groundLevel`. We have to also take into account the
    item's size.

    bounding rectangle size, which is not as wide as `m_fieldWidth`. So the scene

    the `m_fieldWidth` length. Take a look at the following diagram to see the variables

    because of an auto-repeat. If this is the case, we exit the function, because
    we only want to react on the first real key press event. Also, we do not call
    the base class implementation of that event handler since no item on the scene
    needs to get a key press event. If you do have items that could and should receive
    events, do not forget to forward them while reimplementing event handlers at the
    scene.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you press and hold a key down, Qt will continuously deliver the key press
    event. To determine whether it was the first real key press or an autogenerated
    event, use `QKeyEvent::isAutoRepeat()`. It returns `true` if the event was automatically
    generated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As soon as we know that the event was not delivered by an auto repeat, we react
    to the different key presses. Instead of calling the `setDirection()` method of
    the `Player *m_player` field directly, we use the `m_horizontalInput` class field
    to accumulate the input value. Whenever it's changed, we ensure the correctness
    of the value before passing it to `setDirection()`. For that, we use `qBound()`,
    which returns a value that is bound by the first and the last arguments. The argument
    in the middle is the actual value that we want to get bound, so the possible values
    in our case are restricted to -1, 0, and 1.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might wonder, why not simply call `m_player->setDirection(1)` when the right
    key is pressed? Why accumulate the inputs in the  `m_horizontalInput` variable?
    Well, Benjamin is moved by the left and right arrow keys. If the right key is
    pressed, 1 is added; if it gets released, -1 is added. The same applies for the
    left key, but only the other way around. The addition of the value rather than
    setting it is now necessary because of a situation where a user presses and holds
    the right key, and the value of `m_direction` is therefore 1\. Now, without releasing
    the right key, they also press and hold the left key. Therefore, the value of
    `m_direction` is getting decreased by one; the value is now 0 and Benjamin stops.
    However, remember that both keys are still being pressed. What happens when the
    left key is released? How would you know in this situation in which direction
    Benjamin should move? To achieve that, you would have to find out an additional
    bit of information—whether the right key is still pressed down or not, which seems
    too much trouble and overhead. In our implementation, when the left key is released,
    1 is added and the value of `m_direction` becomes 1, making Benjamin move right.
    Voilà! All without any concern about what the state of the other button might
    be.

    variable, expressed in pixels. You can create setter and getter functions for
    that variable if you like. For us, the default value of 4 pixels will do the job.
    Multiplied by the direction (which could only be 1 or -1 at this point), we get
    a shift of the player by 4 pixels to the right or to the left. Based on this shift,
    we calculate the new *x* position of the player. Next, we check whether that new
    position is inside the range of `m_minX` and `m_maxX`, two member variables that
    are already calculated and set up properly at this point. Then, if the new position
    is not equal to the actual position, which is stored in `m_currentX`, we proceed
    by assigning the new position as the current one. Otherwise, we exit the function

    its position relative to the allowed area defined by the `shiftBorder` and `rightShiftBorder`
    variables. If `visiblePlayerPos` is beyond the right border of the allowed area,
    `newWorldShiftRight` will be positive, we need to shift the world by `newWorldShiftRight`
    to the right. Similarly, when we need to shift it to the left, `newWorldShiftLeft`
    will be positive, and it will contain the needed amount of shift. Finally, we
    update the position of `m_player` using a `setX()` helper method that is similar
    to `setPos()` but leaves the *y* coordinate unchanged.

    as the view's left border, both at point (0, 0). At the end, when Benjamin has
    walked to the maximum right, the sky's right border should be the same as the
    view's right border. So, at this position, the shift of the sky will be equal
    to the sky's width (`m_sky->boundingRect().width()`) minus the width of the view
    (`width()`). The shift of the sky depends on the position of the camera and, consequently,
    the value of the `m_worldShift` variable; if it is far to the left, the sky isn't
    shifted, and if the camera is far to the right, the sky is maximally shifted.
    Thus, we have to multiply the sky's maximum shift value with a factor based on
    the current position of the camera. The relation to the camera's position is the
    reason this is handled in the `movePlayer()` function. The factor we have to calculate
    has to be between 0 and 1\. So we get the minimum shift (`0 * shift`, which equals
    0) and the maximum shift (`1 * shift`, which equals `shift`). We name this factor
    as `ratio`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How far the world was shifted is saved in `m_worldShift`, so by dividing `m_worldShift`
    by `maxWorldShift`, we get the needed factor. It is 0 when the player is to the

    `ratio` with the maximum shift of the sky.

    a parent; thus, the animation will get deleted when the scene deletes the item,
    and we don't have to worry about freeing the used memory. Then, we define the
    target of the animation—our `MyScene` class—and the property that should be animated, `jumpFactor`,
    in this case. Then, we define the start and the end value of that property; in
    addition to that, we also define a value in between, by setting `setKeyValueAt()`.
    The first argument of the `qreal` type defines time inside the animation, where
    0 is the beginning and 1 the end, and the second argument defines the value that
    the animation should have at that time. So your `jumpFactor` element will get
    animated from 0 to 1 and back to 0 in 800 milliseconds. This was defined by `setDuration()`.
    Finally, we define how the interpolation between the start and end value should
    be done and call `setEasingCurve()`, with `QEasingCurve::OutInQuad` as an argument.

    This is done by subtracting half of the item's height from the ground level's
    value since the item's origin point is in its center. Then, we subtract the maximum
    jump height, defined by `m_jumpHeight`, which is multiplied by the actual jump
    factor. Since the factor is in the range of 0 and 1, the new *y* coordinate stays
    inside the allowed jump height. Then, we alter the player item's *y* position
    by calling `setY()`, leaving the *x* coordinate as the same. Et voilà, Benjamin

    Widgets), add-ons may be supported on a limited number of platforms. As of Qt

    object of this class can be obtained using the `QGamepadManager::instance()` function.
    It allows you to request the list of identifiers of the available gamepads using
    the `connectedGamepads()` function. The `gamepadConnected()` signal can be used
    to detect new gamepads on the fly. `QGamepadManager` also provides API for configuring
    buttons and axes on the gamepad and is able to save the configuration to the specified
    settings file.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you should create a new `QGamepad` object and pass the obtained device identifier
    as a constructor's argument. You can use the first available gamepad or allow
    the user to select which gamepad to use. In this case, you can utilize the gamepad's `name`
    property that returns a readable name of the device.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `Gamepad` object contains a dedicated property for each axis and button.
    This gives you two ways to receive the information about the state of the controls. First,
    you can use the getter of the property to check the current state of a button
    or an axis. For example, the `buttonL1()` function will return `true` if the L1
    button is currently pressed, and the `axisLeftX()` will return the current horizontal
    position of the left stick as a `double` value that is in the range of -1 to 1\.
    For trigger buttons (for example, `buttonL2()`), the property contains a `double`
    value that ranges from 0 (not pressed) to 1 (fully pressed).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second way is to use the signals corresponding to each property. For example,

    function. In that phase, each item should advance, whatever that means—maybe moving,
