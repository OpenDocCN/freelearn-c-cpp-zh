<h1 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor092"/>Character Class Components and Blueprint Setup</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter, we learned how to create empty projects and import files, which folder structure to use, and how to work with animations. In this chapter, we’ll explore some other key tools and functionality that you will work with when using Unreal Engine.</p>
<p>Game developers often need to use certain tools that save them time and energy when building game functionality. Unreal Engine’s powerful object inheritance capabilities give developers the edge they need to be more efficient. Developers can also work with both C++ and Blueprints interchangeably and use them to their benefit when developing games.</p>
<p>Another value-added benefit developers gain is the ability to extend code for use later in a project. Let’s say your client has new requirements that build upon the old ones (as is the case in most game studios). Now, to extend functionality, developers can just inherit a class and add more functionality to it to get results quickly. This is very powerful, and it comes in handy in many situations.</p>
<p>This chapter will focus on the <code>Character</code> class in C++. You will be shown how to extend the <code>Character</code> class in C++ and then extend this newly created <code>Character</code> class further in Blueprints via inheritance. You will also work with player input and some movement logic. We will discuss the Unreal <code>Character</code> class, create C++ code, and then extend it in Blueprints, before finally using it to create an in-game character.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Unreal <code>Character</code> class</li>
<li>Extending the C++ class with Blueprints</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of this chapter, you will understand how class inheritance works in UE5 and how to utilize it to your advantage. You will also be able to work with Axis Mappings and Action Input Mappings, which are key in driving player-related input logic.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor093"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p>This chapter has the following technical requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unreal Engine 5 installed</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2019 installed</li>
</ul>
<p>The complete code for this chapter can be downloaded from GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Elevating-Game-Experiences-with-Unreal-Engine-5-Second-Edition">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Elevating-Game-Experiences-with-Unreal-Engine-5-Second-Edition</a>.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor094"/>The Unreal Character class</h1>
<p>Before we talk about the Unreal <code>Character</code> class, let’s briefly touch on the concept of inheritance. If you’re used to working with C++ or another similar language, you should already be familiar with <a id="_idIndexMarker265"/>this concept. Inheritance is the process whereby a class derives characteristics and behavior from another class. A C++ class can be extended to create a new class – a derived class – that retains properties of the base class and allows these properties to be modified or new characteristics to be added. An example of this is the <code>Character</code> class.</p>
<p>The <code>Character</code> class is a special type of pawn and is a descendant of the Unreal <code>Pawn</code> class. Extending upon <a id="_idIndexMarker266"/>the <code>Pawn</code> class, the <code>Character</code> class has some movement capabilities by default, along with some inputs that add movement to the character. As standard, the <code>Character</code> class gives users the ability to get a character to walk, run, jump, fly, and swim within the created world.</p>
<p>Since the <code>Character</code> class is an extension of the <code>Pawn</code> class, it contains all the code/logic of the pawn, and developers can extend this class to add more functionality to it. When extending the <code>Character</code> class, its existing components get carried over to the extended class as inherited components (in this case, the Capsule, Arrow, and Mesh components). </p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">Inherited components cannot be removed. Their settings may be changed, but a component that’s added to a base class will always be present in the extended class. In this case, the base class is the <code>Pawn</code> class, while the extended (or child) class is the <code>Character</code> class.</p>
<p>The <code>Character</code> class provides <a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>the following inherited components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Capsule component</strong>: This is the root component that serves as the “origin” that other components get attached to within the hierarchy. This component can also be used for collisions and takes the form of a capsule that logically outlines many character forms (especially humanoid ones<a id="_idTextAnchor095"/>).</li>
<li><code>hide</code> when the game starts, but it can be tweaked to be visible. This component can be useful for debugging and adjusting game logic if required.</li>
<li><code>Character</code> class. The Skeletal Mesh, which is the form the character will take, can be set up here, along with all the relevant variables, including animations, collisions, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most developers usually prefer to code the game and character logic in C++ and extend that class to Blueprints <a id="_idIndexMarker268"/>so that they can perform other simple tasks, such as connecting assets to the class. So, for example, a developer may create a C++ class that inherits from the <code>Character</code> class, write all the movement and jumping logic within that class, and then extend this class with a Blueprint, in which the developer updates the components with the required assets (such as the Skeletal Mesh and animation blueprint), and optionally code additional functionality into blueprints.</p>
<h3>Extending the Character class</h3>
<p>The <code>Character</code> class is <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>extended when it is inherited by either C++ or Blueprints. This extended <code>Character</code> class will be a child of the <code>Character</code> class (<em class="italic">which will be called its parent</em>). Extending classes is a powerful part of object-oriented programming, and classes can be extended to great depths and hierarchies.</p>
<h3>Exercise 3.01 – creating and setting up a third-person Character C++ class </h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will create a C++ class based on a <code>Character</code> class. You will also initialize the variables <a id="_idIndexMarker270"/>that will be set in the default values for <a id="_idIndexMarker271"/>the class that will extend this <code>Character</code> class.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to complete this exercise:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch Unreal Engine, select the <strong class="bold">Games</strong> category, and click the <strong class="bold">Next</strong> button.</li>
<li>Select <strong class="bold">Blank</strong> and click the <strong class="bold">Next</strong> button.</li>
<li>Choose <code>MyThirdPerson</code>, choose a suitable project directory, and click the <strong class="bold">Create Project</strong> button.</li>
<li>Right-click in the <strong class="bold">Content Browser</strong> area and click the <strong class="bold">New C++ Class</strong> button.</li>
<li>In the dialog box that opens, select <code>Character</code> as the class type and click the <strong class="bold">Next</strong> button. </li>
<li>Name it <code>MyThirdPersonChar</code> and click the <strong class="bold">Create Class</strong> button. </li>
<li>Upon doing so, Visual Studio will open the <code>MyThirdPersonChar.cpp</code> and <code>MyThirdPersonChar.h</code> tabs.</li>
</ol>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">On some systems, you might be required to run the Unreal Engine editor with administrator privileges to automatically open the Visual Studio solution with the newly created C++ files.</p>
<ol>
<li value="8">Open the <code>MyThirdPersonChar.h</code> tab and add the following code under the <code>GENERATED_BODY()</code> text:<pre>// Spring arm component which will act as a 
// placeholder for 
// the player camera. This component is recommended to // be used as it automatically controls how the 
//camera handles situations
// where it becomes obstructed by geometry inside the 
// level, etc
UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly, Category = 
  MyTPS_Cam, meta = (AllowPrivateAccess = "true"))
class USpringArmComponent* CameraBoom;
// Follow camera
UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly, Category = 
  MyTPS_Cam, meta = (AllowPrivateAccess = "true"))
class UCameraComponent* FollowCamera;</pre></li>
</ol>
<p>In the preceding code, we’re declaring two components: the <code>Camera</code> component itself and <code>Camera boom</code>, which acts as the placeholder for the camera at a <a id="_idIndexMarker272"/>certain distance from the player. These <a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>components will be initialized in the constructor in <em class="italic">step 11</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li value="9">Add the following <code>#include</code> statements under <code>#include “CoreMinimal.h”</code>, in the <code>MyThirdPersonChar.h</code> file:<pre>#include "GameFramework/SpringArmComponent.h"
#include "Camera/CameraComponent.h"</pre></li>
<li>Now, go to the <code>MyThirdPersonChar.cpp</code> tab and add the following <code>#include</code> statements after the <code>#include MyThirdPersonChar.h</code> code:<pre>#include "Components/CapsuleComponent.h"
#include "GameFramework/CharacterMovementComponent.h"</pre></li>
</ol>
<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker274"/>preceding code adds the relevant classes to <a id="_idIndexMarker275"/>the class, which means we now have access to its methods and definitions.</p>
<ol>
<li value="11">In the <code>AMyThirdPersonChar::AMyThirdPersonChar()</code> function, add the following lines:<pre>// Set size for collision capsule
GetCapsuleComponent()-&gt;InitCapsuleSize(42.f, 96.0f);
// Don't rotate when the controller rotates. Let that // just 
  affect the camera.
bUseControllerRotationPitch = false;
bUseControllerRotationYaw = false;
bUseControllerRotationRoll = false;
// Configure character movement
GetCharacterMovement()-&gt;bOrientRotationToMovement = true;
// Create a camera boom (pulls in towards the 
  player if there is a collision)
CameraBoom = 
  CreateDefaultSubobject&lt;USpringArmComponent&gt;(
  TEXT("CameraBoom"));
CameraBoom-&gt;SetupAttachment(RootComponent);
CameraBoom-&gt;TargetArmLength = 300.0f;
CameraBoom-&gt;bUsePawnControlRotation = true; 
// Create a camera that will follow the character
FollowCamera = 
  CreateDefaultSubobject&lt;UcameraComponent&gt;(
  TEXT("FollowCamera"));
FollowCamera-&gt;SetupAttachment(CameraBoom, 
  USpringArmComponent::SocketName);
FollowCamera-&gt;bUsePawnControlRotation = false;</pre></li>
</ol>
<p>The last line of the preceding code snippet will set up the camera to bind its rotation <a id="_idIndexMarker276"/>with the pawns’. This means that the camera <a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>should, in turn, rotate based on the rotation of the player controller that’s associated with this pawn. </p>
<ol>
<li value="12">Head back to the Unreal Engine project and click the <strong class="bold">Compile</strong> icon button on the top bar:</li>

<p>After extracting the <code>.rar</code> file, double-click the <code>.uproject</code> file. You will see a prompt asking <code>Would you like to rebuild now?</code>. Click <code>Yes</code> so that it can build the necessary intermediate files, after which it should open the project in Unreal Editor automatically.</p>
<p>By completing this exercise, you’ve learned how to extend the <code>Character</code> class. You have also learned <a id="_idIndexMarker278"/>how to initialize the default components of <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>the <code>Character</code> class and how to compile the updated code from within Unreal Editor. Next, you will learn how to extend the C++ class you created in Blueprints and why that is feasible in many situations.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>Extending the C++ class with Blueprints</h1>
<p>As mentioned earlier, most developers extend the C++ code logic to blueprints to link this with the assets they will use. This is done to achieve easy asset assignment compared to finding and setting up the asset in code. Furthermore, it allows developers to use powerful blueprint features such as Timelines, Events, and ready-to-use macros, in combination with their C++ code, to achieve the maximum benefit of developing with both C++ and Blueprints.</p>
<p>So far, we have made a C++ <code>Character</code> class. In it, we have set up components and movement capabilities. Now, we want to specify the assets that are going to be used in our class, as well as add input and movement ability. For this, it is easier to extend with Blueprint and set up the options there. This is what we will be doing in the next exercise.</p>
<h3>Exercise 3.02 – extending C++ with Blueprints</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you <a id="_idIndexMarker280"/>will learn how to extend the C++ class you <a id="_idIndexMarker281"/>created with Blueprints to add Blueprint code on top of the pre-existing C++ code. You will also be adding input key bindings, which will be responsible for moving the character.</p>

<p>In the activity for this chapter, you will be combining the skills you have gained from the previous exercises of this chapter and extending the project you completed in <em class="italic">Activity 2.01 – linking animations to a character</em> of <a href="B18531_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor043"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Working with Unreal Engine</em>. This will allow you to build on your own Blueprint and see how that maps to real-world scenarios.</p>
<h3>Activity 3.01 – extending the C++ Character class with Blueprints in the Animation project</h3>
<p>Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker305"/>you’ve created <a id="_idIndexMarker306"/>a C++ class and <a id="_idIndexMarker307"/>extended it with Blueprints, it is time to bring both concepts together in a real-world scenario. In this activity, you will be making our character from <em class="italic">Activity 2.01 – linking animations to a character</em>, which can be found in <a href="B18531_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor043"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Working with Unreal Engine</em>, jump using the spacebar key on your keyboard. However, you need to create the <code>Character</code> class from scratch in C++ and then later extend it with Blueprint to reach the final goal.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to complete this activity:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Open the project from <em class="italic">Activity 2.01– linking animations to a character</em>.</li>
<li>Create a <code>Character</code> class in C++ that will initialize the character variables, including the camera associated with the player.</li>
<li>Map the <code>Jump </code>input to the spacebar key in the project settings.</li>
<li>Extend the created C++ class with a blueprint to add the associated assets and jump functionality.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong class="bold">Expected Output</strong></p>
<p>The character should be able to jump when you press the spacebar key. The level should use the Blueprint that extends the C++ <code>Character</code> class:</p>

<p>By completing this <a id="_idIndexMarker308"/>activity, you’ve <a id="_idIndexMarker309"/>understood scenarios where C++ code is extended in Blueprints to implement functionalities <a id="_idIndexMarker310"/>and logic. This combination of C++ and Blueprints is the most powerful tool game developers possess to create masterful and unique games within Unreal Engine.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor098"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, you learned how to create a C++ <code>Character</code> class, add initializer code to it, and then use Blueprints to extend it to set up assets and add additional code. </p>
<p>The result obeys the C++ code, as well as the Blueprint code, and can be used in any purposeful scenario.</p>
<p>You also learned how to set up Axis Mappings that have been mapped to the <em class="italic">W</em>, <em class="italic">A</em>, <em class="italic">S</em>, and <em class="italic">D</em> keys to move players (which is the default movement mapping in many games). You also learned how to make the character jump within the game.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, you will explore Input Mappings in more depth and how to use the Mobile Previewer within Unreal Editor. This will help you create games with solid inputs mapped to game and player logic. It will also allow you to quickly test what your game will look and feel like on a mobile, all within Unreal Editor.</p>
