<h1 id="_idParaDest-157"><a id="_idTextAnchor184"/>Adding Audio-Visual Elements</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter, we learned about the game UI and how to create and add a user interface (also known as a widget) to the screen.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will learn how to add audio and particle effects to our game. Both of these aspects will increase the quality of our game and produce a much more immersive experience for the player.</p>
<p>Sound in video games can come in the form of either sound effects (also known as SFX) or music. Sound effects make the world around you more believable and alive, while the music helps set the tone for your game. Both these aspects are very important to your game.</p>
<p>In competitive games such as <strong class="bold">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</strong> (<strong class="bold">CS: GO</strong>), sound is also extremely important because players need to hear the sounds around them, such as gunshots and footsteps, and which direction they came from, to gather as much information about their surroundings as possible.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio in UE5</li>
<li>Sound attenuation</li>
<li>Understanding Particle Systems</li>
<li>Exploring level design</li>
<li>Extra features</li>
</ul>
<p>Particle effects are important for the same reason that sound effects are important: they make your game world more believable and immersive.</p>
<p>Let’s start this chapter by learning how audio works in UE5.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-158"><a id="_idTextAnchor185"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p>The project for this chapter can be found in the Chapter09 folder of the code bundle for this book, which can be downloaded here: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Elevating-Game-Experiences-with-Unreal-Engine-5-Second-Edition">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Elevating-Game-Experiences-with-Unreal-Engine-5-Second-Edition</a>.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-159"><a id="_idTextAnchor186"/>Audio in UE5</h1>
<p>One of the essential components of any game is sound. Sounds make your game more believable and immersive, which will provide a much better experience for your player. Video games usually have two types of sounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>2D sounds</li>
<li>3D sounds</li>
</ul>
<p>2D sounds don’t have any consideration for the listener’s distance and direction, while 3D sounds can be higher or lower in volume and pan to the right or left, depending on the player’s location. 2D sounds are usually used for music, while 3D sounds are usually used for sound effects. The main sound file types are <code>.wav</code> and <code>.mp3</code>.</p>
<p>Here are some of the <a id="_idIndexMarker698"/>assets and classes related to audio in UE5:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Sound Base</code>: Represents an asset that contains audio. This class is mainly used in C++ and Blueprint to reference an audio file that can be played.</li>
<li><code>Sound Wave</code>: Represents an audio file that has been imported into UE5. It inherits  from <code>Sound Base</code>.</li>
<li><code>Sound Cue</code>: An audio asset that can contain logic related to things such as attenuation (how the volume changes as the listener’s distance varies), looping, sound mixing, and other audio-related functionality. It inherits from <code>Sound Base</code>.</li>
<li><code>Sound Class</code>: An asset that allows you to separate your audio files into groups and manage some of their settings, such as volume and pitch. An example of this would be grouping all your sounds related to sound effects in the <code>SFX</code> sound class, all your character dialog in the Dialog sound class, and so on.</li>
<li><code>Sound Attenuation</code>: An asset that allows you to specify how a 3D sound will behave; for example, at which distance it will start to lower the volume, at which distance it will become inaudible (can’t be heard), whether its volume will change linearly or exponentially as the distance increases, and so on.</li>
<li><code>Audio Component</code>: An actor component that allows you to manage the playback of audio files and their properties. This is useful for setting up continuous playback of sounds, such as background music.</li>
</ul>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">UE5 has a new audio system called <strong class="bold">Meta Sounds</strong>, which allows developers to create sounds <a id="_idIndexMarker699"/>using <strong class="bold">Digital Signal Processing</strong> (<strong class="bold">DSP</strong>). Because this topic is outside the scope of this book, we will not be covering this system. If you want to know more about the system and how it works, you can do so by going to</p>
<p class="callout"><a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/AudioFeatures/MetaSounds/">https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/AudioFeatures/MetaSounds/</a>.</p>
<p>In UE5, we can <a id="_idIndexMarker700"/>import existing sounds the same way we would any other asset: either by dragging a file from Windows File Explorer into the <strong class="bold">Content Browser</strong> area or by clicking the <strong class="bold">Import</strong> button in the <strong class="bold">Content Browser</strong> area. We’ll do this in the next exercise.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-160"><a id="_idTextAnchor187"/>Exercise 9.01 – Importing an audio file</h2>
<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker701"/>exercise, you <a id="_idIndexMarker702"/>will import an existing sound file from your computer into UE5. This audio file will be played when the dodgeball bounces off a surface. </p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">If you don’t have an audio file (either a <code>.mp3</code> or <code>.wav</code> file) available to complete this exercise, you can download the <code>.mp3</code> or <code>.wav</code> file available at <a href="https://www.freesoundeffects.com/free-track/bounce-1-468901/">https://www.freesoundeffects.com/free-track/bounce-1-468901/</a>.</p>
<p class="callout">Save this file as <code>BOUNCE.wav</code>.</p>
<p>Once you have an audio file, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the editor.</li>
<li>Go to the <code>Content</code> folder inside the <code>Audio</code>:</li>
</ol>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.2 – The imported audio file</p>

<li value="6">Open this asset. You should see many properties available for editing. However, we’ll be focusing solely on some of the properties inside the <strong class="bold">Sound</strong> category:</li>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.3 – The Sound asset’s settings</p>
<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker705"/>properties<a id="_idIndexMarker706"/> are available in the <strong class="bold">Sound</strong> category:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Looping</strong>: Whether this sound will loop while being played.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Volume</strong>: The volume of this sound.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Pitch</strong>: The pitch of this sound. The higher the pitch, the higher the frequency, and the higher in tone this sound will be.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Class</strong>: The sound class of this sound.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only property we’ll be changing is the <code>Class</code> property. We could use one of the existing <code>Sound</code> classes that comes with UE5, but let’s create our own for the <code>Dodgeball</code> game to create a new group of sounds for our game.</p>
<ol>
<li value="7">Go to the <code>Audio</code> folder inside the <strong class="bold">Content Browser</strong> area.</li>
<li>Right-click, go to the <code>Sound Class</code> asset. Rename this asset <code>Dodgeball</code>.</li>
<li>Open your imported sound asset and set its <code>Dodgeball</code>:</li>
</ol>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.4 – Changing the Class property to the Dodgeball Sound Class</p>
<p>Now that this imported sound asset belongs to a specific class, you can group other sound effects related to the dodgeball in the same <code>Sound Class</code> and edit their properties through that <code>Sound Class</code>, which includes <code>Volume</code>, <code>Pitch</code>, and many others.</p>
<p>And with that, we can conclude our exercise. You have learned how to import sounds into your project and how to change their basic properties. Now, let’s move on to the next exercise, where <a id="_idIndexMarker707"/>we’ll <a id="_idIndexMarker708"/>be playing a sound whenever a dodgeball bounces off a surface in our game.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-161"><a id="_idTextAnchor188"/>Exercise 9.02 – Playing a sound when the dodgeball bounces off a surface</h2>
<p>In this<a id="_idIndexMarker709"/> exercise, we will <a id="_idIndexMarker710"/>add the necessary functionality to our <code>DodgeballProjectile</code> class so that a sound will play when the dodgeball bounces off a surface.</p>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Close the editor and open Visual Studio.</li>
<li>In the header file for the <code>DodgeballProjectile</code> class, add a protected <code>class USoundBase*</code> property called <code>BounceSound</code>. This property should be a <code>UPROPERTY</code> and have the <code>EditDefaultsOnly</code> tag so that it can be edited in the Blueprint:<pre>// The sound the dodgeball will make when it bounces off of a 
  surface
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = Sound)
class USoundBase* BounceSound;</pre></li>
<li>Once you’ve done this, go to the <code>DodgeballProjectile</code> class’s source file and add an include for the <code>GameplayStatics</code> object:<pre>#include "Kismet/GameplayStatics.h"</pre></li>
<li>Then, at the beginning of the class’s implementation of the <code>OnHit</code> function, before the cast to the <code>DodgeballCharacter</code> class, check whether our <code>BounceSound</code> is a valid property (different than <code>nullptr</code>) and whether the magnitude of the <code>NormalImpulse</code> property is greater than <code>600</code> units (we can access the magnitude by calling its <code>Size</code> function).</li>
</ol>
<p>As we saw in <a href="B18531_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a><em class="italic">, Setting Up Collision Objects</em>, the <code>NormalImpulse</code> property indicates the direction and magnitude of the force that will change the dodgeball’s<a id="_idIndexMarker711"/> trajectory<a id="_idIndexMarker712"/> after it has been hit. The reason why we want to check whether its magnitude is greater than a certain amount is that when the dodgeball starts losing momentum and bounces off the floor several times per second, we don’t want to play <code>BounceSound</code> several times per second; otherwise, it will generate a lot of noise. So, we will check whether the impulse that the dodgeball is suffering is greater than that amount to make sure this doesn’t happen. If both these things are true, we’ll call the <code>GameplayStatics</code> object’s <code>PlaySoundAtLocation</code>. This function is responsible for playing 3D sounds. It receives five parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>A world context object, which we’ll pass as the <code>this</code> pointer.</li>
<li>A <code>SoundBase</code> property, which will be our <code>HitSound</code> property.</li>
<li>The origin of the sound, which we’ll pass using the <code>GetActorLocation</code> function.</li>
<li><code>VolumeMultiplier</code>, which we’ll pass with a value of <code>1</code>. This value indicates how much higher or lower the volume of this sound will be when it’s played. For instance, a value of <code>2</code> means it will have a volume twice as high.</li>
<li><code>PitchMultiplier</code>, which indicates how much higher or lower the pitch of this sound will be when it’s played. We’ll be passing this value by using the <code>FMath</code> object’s <code>RandRange</code> function, which receives two numbers as parameters and returns a random number between those two. To randomly generate a number between <code>0.7</code> and <code>1.3</code>, we’ll be calling this function with these values as parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a look <a id="_idIndexMarker713"/>at the <a id="_idIndexMarker714"/>following code snippet:</p>
<pre>if (BounceSound != nullptr &amp;&amp; NormalImpulse.Size() &gt; 600.0f)
{
  UGameplayStatics::PlaySoundAtLocation(this, BounceSound, 
  GetActorLocation(), 1.0f, FMath::RandRange(0.7f, 1.3f));
}</pre>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">The function responsible for playing 2D sounds is also available from the <code>GameplayStatics</code> object, and it’s called <code>PlaySound2D</code>. This function will receive the same parameters as the <code>PlaySoundAtLocation</code> function, except for the third parameter, which is the origin of the sound.</p>
<ol>
<li value="5">Compile these changes and open Unreal Editor.</li>
<li>Open the <code>BP_DodgeballProjectile</code> Blueprint, go to its <code>BounceSound</code> property to the <code>Sound</code> asset you imported:</li>
</ol>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.5 – Setting the BounceSound property to our imported sound</p>
<ol>
<li value="7">Play the level again and enter the enemy character’s line of sight. You should notice a sound playing with different pitch values every time the dodgeball that’s thrown by<a id="_idIndexMarker715"/> the <a id="_idIndexMarker716"/>enemy character hits a wall or the floor (not the player character):</li>
</ol>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.6 – The player character causing the enemy character to throw dodgeballs</p>
<p>If this happens, congratulations – you’ve successfully played a sound using UE5! If you can’t hear the sound playing, make sure that it is audible (it has a level of volume that you can hear).</p>
<p>However, another thing you’ll probably notice is that the sound is always played at the same volume, regardless <a id="_idIndexMarker717"/>of the <a id="_idIndexMarker718"/>distance that the character is from the dodgeball that is bouncing; the sound isn’t playing in 3D but rather in 2D. To play a sound in 3D using UE5, we’ll have to learn about <strong class="bold">Sound Attenuation</strong> assets.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-162"><a id="_idTextAnchor189"/>Sound attenuation</h1>
<p>For a sound to <a id="_idIndexMarker719"/>be played in 3D inside UE5, you’ll have to create a <strong class="bold">Sound Attenuation</strong> asset, as we mentioned previously. A <strong class="bold">Sound Attenuation</strong> asset will let you specify how you want a specific sound to change volume as its distance from the listener increases. Have a look at the following example.</p>
<p>Open Unreal Editor, go to the <code>Audio</code> folder inside the <code>BounceAttenuation</code>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.7 – Creating the Sound Attenuation asset " height="1013" src="img/Figure_9.07_B18531.jpg" width="1301"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.7 – Creating the Sound Attenuation asset</p>
<p>Open this <code>BounceAttenuation</code> asset.</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Sound Attenuation</strong> assets have many settings; however, we’ll want to focus mainly on a couple of settings from the <strong class="bold">Attenuation Distance</strong> section:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Inner Radius</code>: This <code>float</code> property allows us to specify at what distance the sound <a id="_idIndexMarker720"/>will start lowering in volume. If the sound is played at a distance less than this value, the volume won’t be affected. Set this property to <code>200</code> units.</li>
<li><code>Falloff Distance</code>: This <code>float</code> property allows us to specify at what distance we want the sound to be inaudible. If the sound is played at a distance greater than this value, we won’t hear it. The volume of the sound will vary according to its distance to the listener and whether it’s closer to <code>Inner Radius</code> or <code>Falloff Distance</code>. Set this property to <code>1500</code> units:</li>
</ul>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.8 – The Sound Attenuation asset settings " height="163" src="img/Figure_9.08_B18531.jpg" width="305"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.8 – The Sound Attenuation asset settings</p>
<p>Think of this as two circles around the player, with the smaller circle being the inner circle (with a radius value of <code>Inner Radius</code>) and the bigger circle being the falloff circle (with a radius value of <code>Falloff Distance</code>). If a sound originates from inside the inner circle, it is <a id="_idIndexMarker721"/>played at full volume, while a sound that originates from outside the falloff circle is not played at all.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">You can find more information on <strong class="bold">Sound Attenuation</strong> assets here: <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Audio/DistanceModelAttenuation">https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Audio/DistanceModelAttenuation</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you know about <strong class="bold">Sound Attenuation</strong> assets, let’s move on to the next exercise, where we’ll turn the sound that plays when the dodgeball bounces off the ground into a 3D sound.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-163"><a id="_idTextAnchor190"/>Exercise 9.03 – Turning the bounce sound into a 3D sound</h2>
<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker722"/>exercise, we’ll be<a id="_idIndexMarker723"/> turning<a id="_idIndexMarker724"/> the sound that plays when a dodgeball bounces off the ground, which we added in the previous exercise, into a 3D sound. This means that when the dodgeball bounces off a surface, the sound it plays will vary in volume, depending on its distance from the player. We’re doing this so that when the dodgeball is far away, the sound volume will be low, and when it’s close, its volume will be high.</p>
<p>To use the <code>BounceAttenuation</code> asset we created in the previous section, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Go to the header file for <code>DodgeballProjectile</code> and add a <code>protected</code> <code>class USoundAttenuation*</code> property called <code>BounceSoundAttenuation</code>. This property should be a <code>UPROPERTY</code> and have the <code>EditDefaultsOnly</code> tag so that it can be edited in the Blueprint:<pre>// The sound attenuation of the previous sound
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = Sound)
class USoundAttenuation* BounceSoundAttenuation;</pre></li>
<li>Go to the <code>DodgeballProjectile</code> class’s implementation of the <code>OnHit</code> function in its source file and add the following parameters to the call to the <code>PlaySoundAtLocation</code> function:<ul><li><code>StartTime</code>, which we’ll pass with a value of <code>0</code>. This value indicates the time that the sound will start playing. If the sound lasts 2 seconds, we can have this sound start at its 1-second mark by passing a value of <code>1</code>. We pass a value of <code>0</code> to<a id="_idIndexMarker725"/> have <a id="_idIndexMarker726"/>the <a id="_idIndexMarker727"/>sound play from the start.</li><li><code>SoundAttenuation</code>, to which we’ll pass our <code>BounceSoundAttenuation</code> property:<pre>UGameplayStatics::PlaySoundAtLocation(this, BounceSound, 
  GetActorLocation(), 1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 
  BounceSoundAttenuation);</pre></li></ul></li>
</ol>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">Although we only want to pass the additional <code>SoundAttenuation</code> parameter, we must pass all the other parameters that come before it as well.</p>
<ol>
<li value="3">Compile these changes and then open the editor.</li>
<li>Open the <code>BP_DodgeballProjectile</code> Blueprint, go to its <code>BounceSoundAttenuation</code> property to our <code>BounceAttenuation</code> asset:</li>
</ol>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.9 – Setting the BounceSoundAttenuation property to the BounceAttenuation asset</p>
<ol>
<li value="5">Play the <a id="_idIndexMarker728"/>level<a id="_idIndexMarker729"/> again<a id="_idIndexMarker730"/> and enter the enemy character’s line of sight. You should notice that the sound that plays every time the dodgeball thrown by the enemy character hits a wall or the floor will be played at different volumes, depending on its distance, and that you won’t hear it if the dodgeball is far away:</li>
</ol>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.10 – The player character causing the enemy character to throw dodgeballs</p>
<p>With that, we can <a id="_idIndexMarker731"/>conclude<a id="_idIndexMarker732"/> this<a id="_idIndexMarker733"/> exercise. You now know how to play 3D sounds using UE5. We’ll add background music to our game in the next exercise.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-164"><a id="_idTextAnchor191"/>Exercise 9.04 – Adding background music to our game</h2>
<p>In this<a id="_idIndexMarker734"/> exercise, we will add game <a id="_idIndexMarker735"/>background <a id="_idIndexMarker736"/>music to our game. We will do this by creating a new Actor with an Audio component, which, as we mentioned earlier, is appropriate for playing background music. To achieve this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Download the audio file located at <a href="https://packt.live/3pg21sQ">https://packt.live/3pg21sQ</a> and import it into the <strong class="bold">Audio</strong> folder of the <strong class="bold">Content Browser</strong> area, just like we did in <em class="italic">Exercise 9.01 – Importing an audio file</em>.</li>
<li>Right-click inside the <code>Actor</code> class as its parent class. Name this new class <code>MusicManager</code>.</li>
<li>When the files for this class are generated and Visual Studio has opened automatically, close the editor.</li>
<li>In the <code>MusicManager</code> class’s header file, add a new <code>protected</code> property of the <code>class UAudioComponent*</code> type<a id="_idIndexMarker737"/> called <code>AudioComponent</code>. Make this a <code>UPROPERTY</code> and<a id="_idIndexMarker738"/> add <a id="_idIndexMarker739"/>the <code>VisibleAnywhere</code> and <code>BlueprintReadOnly</code> tags:<pre>UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly)
class UAudioComponent* AudioComponent;</pre></li>
<li>In the <code>MusicManager</code> class’s source file, add an <code>#include</code> for the <code>AudioComponent</code> class:<pre>#include "Components/AudioComponent.h"</pre></li>
<li>In the constructor for this class, change the <code>bCanEverTick</code> property to <code>false</code>:<pre>PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = false;</pre></li>
<li>After this line, add a new one that creates the <code>AudioComponent</code> class by calling the <code>CreateDefaultSubobject</code> function and passing the <code>UAudioComponent</code> class as a template parameter and <code>“Music Component”</code> as a normal parameter:<pre>AudioComponent = 
  CreateDefaultSubobject&lt;UAudioComponent&gt;(TEXT("Music 
  Component"));</pre></li>
<li>After making these changes, compile your code and open the editor.</li>
<li>Go to the <code>ThirdPersonCPP</code> | <code>Blueprints</code> folder in the <code>MusicManager</code> class. Name it <code>BP_MusicManager</code>.</li>
<li>Open this asset, select its <code>Audio</code> component, and set that component’s <code>Sound</code> property to your imported sound:</li>

<p>With <a id="_idIndexMarker740"/>that, we’ve<a id="_idIndexMarker741"/> completed this exercise. You<a id="_idIndexMarker742"/> now know how to add simple background music to your game.</p>
<p>Now, let’s jump into the next topic, which is Particle Systems.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-165"><a id="_idTextAnchor192"/>Understanding Particle Systems</h1>
<p>Let’s talk about<a id="_idIndexMarker743"/> another very important element of many video games: Particle Systems.</p>
<p>In video game terms, a particle is essentially a position in a 3D space that can be represented with an image. A Particle System is a collection of many particles, potentially with different images, shapes, colors, and sizes. The following figure shows an example of two Particle Systems made in UE5:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.12 – Two different Particle Systems in UE5 " height="778" src="img/Figure_9.12_B18531.jpg" width="1650"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.12 – Two different Particle Systems in UE5</p>
<p>The Particle System on the left is supposed to be electrical sparks that could come from a cable that has been sliced and is now in short-circuit, while the one on the right is supposed to be a fire. Although the particle system on the left is relatively simple, you can tell that the one on the right has more than one type of particle inside it, which can be combined in the same system.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">UE5 has two different tools for creating Particle Systems: <strong class="bold">Cascade and Niagara</strong>. Cascade has been present since the beginning of UE5, while Niagara is a system that is more recent and sophisticated and has only been production-ready since May 2020, as of Unreal Engine version 4.25.</p>
<p class="callout">Creating Particle Systems in UE5 is outside the scope of this book, but it is recommended that you use Niagara over Cascade, given that it is a more recent addition to the engine.</p>
<p class="callout">In this chapter, we will only be using Particle Systems that are already included in UE5, but if you want to create your own, these links will give you more information about both Cascade and Niagara:</p>

<p>We’ll learn how to <a id="_idIndexMarker744"/>add Particle Systems to our game in the next exercise. In this chapter, we will simply be using existing Particle Systems that were already made by the UE5 team.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-166"><a id="_idTextAnchor193"/>Exercise 9.05 – Spawning a Particle System when the dodgeball hits the player</h2>
<p>In this exercise, we <a id="_idIndexMarker745"/>will learn how to spawn a Particle System in UE5. In this case, we will be spawning an <code>explosion</code> Particle System when a dodgeball thrown by the enemy hits the player.</p>
<p>To achieve this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Close the editor and open Visual Studio.</li>
<li>In the <code>DodgeballProjectile</code> class’s header file, add a protected <code>class UParticleSystem*</code> property called <code>HitParticles</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>UParticleSystem</code> type is the designation for a Particle System in UE5. Be sure to make this a <code>UPROPERTY</code> and give it the <code>EditDefaultsOnly</code> tag so that it can be edited in the Blueprint class:</p>
<pre>// The particle system the dodgeball will spawn when it hits 
  the player
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = Particles)
class UParticleSystem* HitParticles;</pre>
<ol>
<li value="3">In the <code>DodgeballProjectile</code> class’s source file, inside its implementation of the <code>OnHit</code> function, before the call to the <code>Destroy</code> function, check whether our <code>HitParticles</code> property is valid. If it is, call the <code>GameplayStatics</code> object’s <code>SpawnEmitterAtLocation</code> function.</li>
</ol>
<p>This function will spawn an actor that will play the Particle System we pass as a parameter. It receives the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>World</code> object, which we’ll pass using the <code>GetWorld</code> function</li>
<li>A <code>UParticleSystem*</code> property, which will be our <code>HitParticles</code> property</li>
<li>The <code>FTransform</code> of the actor that will play the Particle System, which we’ll pass using the <code>GetActorTransform</code> function:<pre>if (HitParticles != nullptr)
{
  UGameplayStatics::SpawnEmitterAtLocation(GetWorld(), 
  HitParticles, GetActorTransform());
}</pre></li>
</ul>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">Although we won’t be using it in this project, there is another function related to spawning Particle Systems available from the <code>GameplayStatics</code> object, which is the <code>SpawnEmitterAttached</code> function. This function will spawn a Particle System and attach it to an actor, which might be useful if you want to, for instance, make a moving object light on fire so that the Particle System will always remain attached to that object.</p>
<ol>
<li value="4">Compile<a id="_idIndexMarker746"/> these changes and open the editor.</li>
<li>Open the <code>BP_DodgeballProjectile</code> Blueprint, go to its <code>HitParticles</code> property to the <code>P_Explosion</code> Particle System asset:</li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.13 – Setting the HitParticles property to P_Explosion " height="87" src="img/Figure_9.13_B18531.jpg" width="461"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.13 – Setting the HitParticles property to P_Explosion</p>
<ol>
<li value="6">Now, play the level and let your player character get hit by a dodgeball. You should see the explosion Particle System being played:</li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.14 – The explosion particle system being played when the dodgeball hits the player " height="268" src="img/Figure_9.14_B18531.jpg" width="324"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.14 – The explosion particle system being played when the dodgeball hits the player</p>
<p>And that concludes this exercise. You now know how to play Particle Systems in UE5. Particle Systems<a id="_idIndexMarker747"/> add visual flair to your game and make it more visually appealing.</p>
<p>In the next activity, we’ll be consolidating our knowledge of playing audio in UE5 by playing a sound when the dodgeball hits the player.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-167"><a id="_idTextAnchor194"/>Activity 9.01 – Playing a sound when the dodgeball hits the player</h2>
<p>In this activity, we<a id="_idIndexMarker748"/> will be creating the logic responsible for playing a sound every time the player character gets hit by a dodgeball. In a video game, it’s very important to transmit the player’s crucial information in many ways, so in addition to changing the player character’s health bar, we’ll also be playing a sound when the player gets hit so that the player knows that the character is taking damage.</p>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Import a sound file that will be played when the player character gets hit into the <code>Audio</code> folder inside the <strong class="bold">Content Browser</strong> area.</li>
</ol>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">If you don’t have a sound file, you can use the one available at <a href="https://www.freesoundeffects.com/free-track/punch-426855/">https://www.freesoundeffects.com/free-track/punch-426855/</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li value="2">Open the <code>DodgeballProjectile</code> class’s header file. Add a <code>SoundBase*</code> property, just like we did in <em class="italic">Exercise 9.02 – Playing a sound when the dodgeball bounces off a surface</em>, but this time, call it <code>DamageSound</code>.</li>
<li>Open the <code>DodgeballProjectile</code> class’s source file. In the <code>OnHit</code> function’s <a id="_idIndexMarker749"/>implementation, once you’ve damaged the player character and before you call the <code>Destroy</code> function, check whether the <code>DamageSound</code> property is valid. If it is, call the <code>GameplayStatics</code> object’s <code>PlaySound2D</code> function (mentioned in <em class="italic">Exercise 9.02 – Playing a sound when the dodgeball bounces off a surface</em>), passing <code>this</code> and <code>DamageSound</code> as the parameters to that function call.</li>
<li>Compile your changes and open the editor.</li>
<li>Open the <code>BP_DodgeballProjectile</code> Blueprint and set its <code>DamageSound</code> property to the sound file you imported at the start of this activity.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you play the level, you should notice that every time the player gets hit by a dodgeball, you will hear the sound you imported being played:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.15 – A sound should play when the player character gets hit " height="268" src="img/Figure_9.14_B18531.jpg" width="324"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.15 – A sound should play when the player character gets hit</p>
<p>And with those <a id="_idIndexMarker750"/>steps complete, you have finished this activity and consolidated the use of playing both 2D and 3D sounds in UE5.</p>

<p>Now, let’s wrap up this chapter by learning a bit about the concept of level design.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-168"><a id="_idTextAnchor195"/>Exploring level design</h1>
<p>Since <a href="B18531_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor113"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Query with Line Traces</em>, which <a id="_idIndexMarker751"/>was related to our dodgeball game, we added a few game mechanics and gameplay opportunities, as well as some audio-visual elements, all of which were handled in this chapter. Now that we have all these game elements, we must bring them together into a level that can be played from start to finish by the player. To do that, let’s learn a bit about level design and level blockouts.</p>
<p>Level design is a specific game design discipline that focuses on building levels in a game. The goal of a level designer is to make a level that is fun to play, introduces new gameplay concepts to the player by using the game mechanics built for that game, contains good pacing (a good balance of action-packed and relaxed gameplay sequences), and much more.</p>
<p>To test the structure of a level, level designers must build what is called a <strong class="bold">level blockout</strong>. This is a <a id="_idIndexMarker752"/>very simple and boiled-down version of the level that uses most of the elements that the final level will contain, but it is made using only simple shapes and geometry. This <a id="_idIndexMarker753"/>is so that it will be easier and less time-consuming to modify the level in case parts of it need to be changed:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.16 – An example of a level blockout made in UE5 using BSP Brushes " height="412" src="img/Figure_9.16_B18531.jpg" width="700"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.16 – An example of a level blockout made in UE5 using BSP Brushes</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">It should be noted that level design is its own specific game development skill and is worthy of its own book, of which there are quite a few, but diving into this topic is outside the scope of this book.</p>
<p>In the next exercise, we will be building a simple level blockout using the mechanics we built in the last few chapters.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-169"><a id="_idTextAnchor196"/>Exercise 9.06 – Building a level blockout</h2>
<p>In this exercise, we will be <a id="_idIndexMarker754"/>creating a new level blockout that will contain some structure, where the player will start in a certain place in the level and have to go through a series of obstacles to reach the end of the level. We will be using all the mechanics and objects that we built in the last few chapters to make a level that the player will be able to complete.</p>
<p>Although we will be providing you with a solution in this exercise, you are encouraged to let your creativity loose and come up with a solution yourself, given that there is no right or wrong answer in this case.</p>
<p>To start this exercise, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Open the editor.</li>
<li>Go to the <code>ThirdPersonCPP</code> | <code>Maps</code> folder in the <code>ThirdPersonExampleMap</code> asset, and name it <code>Level1</code>. You can do this by either selecting the asset and pressing <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">D</em> or by right-clicking on the asset and selecting <strong class="bold">Duplicate</strong> (the third option). This may not be available in some situations, so you’ll have to do this by copying and pasting the existing level (<em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">C</em> and <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">V</em>).</li>
<li>Open the newly created <code>Level1</code> map.</li>
<li>Delete all the objects that have a mesh inside the map, except for the following:<ul><li>The <code>PlayerStart</code> object</li><li>The enemy character (note that both characters will look the same)</li><li>The <code>floor</code> object</li><li>Both <code>Wall</code> objects that we created</li><li>The <code>VictoryBox</code> object</li></ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind that assets related to lighting and sound should remain untouched.</p>
<ol>
<li value="5">Build the lighting for <code>Level1</code> by pressing the <strong class="bold">Build</strong> button. This button is to the left of the <strong class="bold">Play</strong> button, in the <strong class="bold">Toolbar</strong> area at the top of the editor window.</li>
<li>At this point, you should have an empty floor with just the objects you’ll be needing for this level (the ones mentioned in <em class="italic">Step 4</em>). Here’s the <code>Level1</code> map before and after you followed <em class="italic">Steps 4</em> and <em class="italic">5</em>, respectively:</li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.17 – Before deleting the required objects " height="355" src="img/Figure_9.17_B18531.jpg" width="832"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.17 – Before deleting the required objects</p>
<p>Once you have <a id="_idIndexMarker755"/>deleted the objects, your floor should look as follows:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.18 – After deleting the required objects  " height="299" src="img/Figure_9.18_B18531.jpg" width="844"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.18 – After deleting the required objects </p>
<p>Because building a level, even a simple one, is something that takes a lot of steps and instructions, you will simply be shown a few screenshots of a possible level and, again, be encouraged to come up with your own.</p>
<ol>
<li value="7">In this case, we have simply used the existing <code>EnemyCharacter</code>, <code>Wall</code>, and <code>GhostWall</code> objects and duplicated them several times to create a simple layout that the player can traverse from start to finish. We also moved the <code>VictoryBox</code> object so that it matches the new level’s end location:</li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.19 – The created level – isometric view " height="770" src="img/Figure_9.19_B18531.jpg" width="1099"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.19 – The created level – isometric view</p>
<p>The level <a id="_idIndexMarker756"/>can be seen in a top-down view too, as follows:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.20 – The created level – top-down view with the player character marked with an arrow " height="757" src="img/Figure_9.20_B18531.jpg" width="848"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.20 – The created level – top-down view with the player character marked with an arrow</p>
<p>Once you’re happy with the result, this means you have finished your dodgeball game and can now <a id="_idIndexMarker757"/>ask your friends and family to play it and see what they think. Great job – you are one step closer to mastering the art of game development!</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-170"><a id="_idTextAnchor197"/>Extra features</h1>
<p>Before we <a id="_idIndexMarker758"/>conclude this chapter, here are some suggestions on what you can do next in this dodgeball project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it so that the normal <code>Wall</code> class we created in <a href="B18531_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Setting Up Collision Objects</em>, doesn’t block the enemy’s line of sight. This way, the enemy will always throw dodgeballs at the player, which should still be blocked from going through this wall.</li>
<li>Add a new feature that will allow the player to visualize where the dodgeball thrown by the enemy character will impact first, using the concept of <strong class="bold">Sweep Traces</strong>.</li>
<li>Add a new type of wall that blocks the player character, the enemy character, and the dodgeballs, but that also takes damage from dodgeballs and gets destroyed when it runs out of health points.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a whole world of possibilities for expanding the scope of this project. You are encouraged to<a id="_idIndexMarker759"/> use the skills you’ve learned and do further research to build new features and add more complexity to your game.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-171"><a id="_idTextAnchor198"/>Summary</h1>
<p>You have now completed the dodgeball game project. In this chapter, you learned how to add polish to your game by playing audio and using Particle Systems. You now know how to add 2D and 3D sounds to your game, as well as some of the tools at your disposal regarding that. Now, you can try to add even more sound effects to your game, such as a special sound effect for when an enemy character sees you for the first time (such as in <em class="italic">Metal Gear Solid</em>), a footstep sound effect, or a victory sound effect.</p>
<p>You also built a level using all the tools that you have made throughout the last few chapters, thus culminating all the logic we have built in this project.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we’ll be starting a new project: the <code>SuperSideScroller</code> game. In that project, you’ll be introduced to such topics as power-ups, collectibles, enemy <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>), character animation, and much more. You will be creating a side-scrolling platform game where you control a character that must complete a level, collect gems, and use power-ups to avoid the enemies. The two most important topics you will learn about are UE5’s behavior trees and Blackboards, which fuel the AI system, and Animation Blueprints, which allow you to manage your character’s animations.</p>
