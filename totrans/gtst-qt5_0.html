<p class="mce-root">There are many buzzwords in computing today, most of which revolve around various software technologies and concepts. Browsers have become the preferred means of accessing information and consuming all manner of data. But there is still a void that can only be filled by standalone applications that must be installed and run on an operating system. The browser itself as an application cannot be accessed through a browser and bears witness to this assertion.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Applications such as VLC, Adobe Photoshop, Google Earth, and QGIS are a few examples of applications that run directly on an operating system. Interestingly enough, these well-known software brands are built with Qt.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Qt (pronounced "cute") is a cross-platform application framework and widget toolkit that is used in creating graphical user interface applications that run on a number of different hardware and operating systems. The aforementioned applications were written using this same toolkit.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The main aim of this book is to introduce Qt to the reader. Through the use of simple and easy-to-understand examples, it will walk the user from one concept to the next without focusing too much on theory. The size of the book requires us to be concise in our presentation of materials. Coupled with the ample examples presented, we hope to shorten the path to understanding and learning how to use Qt.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Who this book is for</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Anyone looking to embark on the development of graphical user interface applications will find this book useful. No prior exposure to other toolkits is required in order to understand this book. However, having such skills will prove useful.</p>
<p>The book does, however, presume that you have a working knowledge in the use of C++. If you can express your thoughts in developing algorithms and the use of object-oriented programming, you will find the content easy to consume.</p>
<p>Expert or intermediate persons with Qt knowledge should seek more detailed materials that are available out there. This book is not a reference guide, and should only be used as introductory material.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">To get the most out of this book</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The beginning of each chapter will begin with a little theory that should help consolidate your understanding. Thereafter, a series of examples are used to explain the concepts and to help the reader grasp the topic better.</p>
<p>This book also avoids continuing with examples from previous chapters. Each chapter's examples are short and do not require the reader to have knowledge of previous chapters. That way, you can pick any chapter you link and work through it.</p>
<p>Appropriate links to set up the environment on Windows have been provided. Linux and macOS platforms have been catered for directly in this book.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Conventions used</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example:  "To set the password to the <kbd>connection</kbd> parameter, the code fragment,  <kbd>db_conn.setPassword("")</kbd>, is issued."<br/></p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>QSqlDatabase db_conn =<br/>        QSqlDatabase::addDatabase("QMYSQL", "contact_db");<br/><br/>db_conn.setHostName("127.0.0.1");<br/>db_conn.setDatabaseName("contact_db");<br/>db_conn.setUserName("root");<br/>db_conn.setPassword("");<br/>db_conn.setPort(3306);<br/></pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>[default]<br/>exten =&gt; s,1,Dial(Zap/1|30)<br/>exten =&gt; s,2,Voicemail(u100)<br/><strong>exten =&gt; s,102,Voicemail(b100)</strong><br/>exten =&gt; i,1,Voicemail(s0)</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>% mkdir helloWorld</strong><br/><strong>% ./run_executable</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see on screen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "It displays the text Hello world ! in a label."</p>
<p>Warnings or important notes appear like this.</p>
<p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p>
