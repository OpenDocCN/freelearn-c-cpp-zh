- en: '**Godot Engine** is a piece of open-source software that lets people from all
    experience levels and walks of life create games. The project was started in 2007
    by Juan Linietsky and Ariel Manzur as an in-house engine for several Argentinian
    game studios. In late 2014, the engine got open-sourced, giving everyone free
    access to the code. Since then, it has gained lots of traction and is currently
    one of the most used game engines on the market. Many commercial games have been
    released or are under development using the engine. Examples of released games
    are Brotato, Dome Keeper, Case of the Golden Idol, and Cassette Beasts.'

    *Waiting for Godot*, by Samuel Beckett. This choice of name is because people
    will always be waiting for the next version or new feature, resulting in an endless
    cycle of waiting.

    of the way. In short, there is no standard way of pronouncing Godot. Because of
    the association with the play’s title, which is written in French, some people
    say it should be “go-do,” without emphasis on any syllable. But most English speakers
    would say “GOH-doh” and stress the first syllable. Then, there is the stream of
    people that pronounce it “go-DOT,” mainly because it sounds similar to the word
    “robot” and the engine’s logo is a blue robot. But I notice that I say Godot differently
    each time. So, to cut a long story short, pronounce it however you like. Just
    use roughly the same letters.

    the original project. The creator will then review what the other person has done,
    alter it a bit if needed, and then add it to the code of the original software.

    Library of Godot. This library can provide custom nodes, scripts, or any other

    3D editor or AssetLib, but it is good to know they are there.
