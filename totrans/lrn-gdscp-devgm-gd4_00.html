			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>Godot Engine is the most popular free open-source game engine on the market. With the advent of Godot 4.0 and the release of many hit games made in Godot, such as <em class="italic">Dome Keeper</em>, <em class="italic">Brotato</em>, and <em class="italic">Case of the Golden Idol</em>, this popularity only grew. There is no better time to learn how to use this wonderful game development tool <span class="No-Break">than now.</span></p>
			<p>Learning how to program and use a new game engine can be a daunting task. However, this book will guide you step by step through all the aspects of creating your own game from scratch, from the basics of writing our first scripts in GDScript to more <span class="No-Break">advanced topics.</span></p>
			<p>We’ll learn how to program in GDScript, the custom language of the Godot Engine, which is easy to learn yet very capable and performant for game development. Then, we’ll go over all the ins and outs of the engine’s intuitive graphical interface and discover everything about its flexible node-based approach to <span class="No-Break">game development.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for programmers, game designers, game developers, and game artists who want to start creating games in Godot 4. If you’re new to coding or game development, looking for a new creative outlet, and want to give Godot 4 and GDScript 2.0 a try, this book is for you. While no prior knowledge of programming or Godot is required, this book gradually introduces more complex concepts as you advance through <span class="No-Break">the chapters.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B19358_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Setting Up the Environment</em>, starts off the book by setting up everything we need to create games in the Godot Engine and gives a brief overview of the engine and how to <span class="No-Break">write scripts.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19358_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Getting Familiar with Variables and Control Flow</em>, explains the major concepts of what variables are and how we can store data within them. From here, we go over different control flows that help us make decisions during the execution of <span class="No-Break">our game.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19358_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor100"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Grouping Information in Arrays, Loops, and Dictionaries</em>, teaches about two new data types: arrays and dictionaries. These will help us group data in a more structured format. Along the way, we will learn about the two different kinds of loops with which we can loop over different sets <span class="No-Break">of data.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19358_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor164"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Bringing Structure with Methods and Classes</em>, delves into writing reusable pieces of code using methods and how to structure variables and methods <span class="No-Break">into classes.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19358_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor365"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">How and Why to Keep Your Code Clean</em>, introduces many concepts around writing clean code, which will help us create code that is reusable and understandable by others as well <span class="No-Break">as ourselves.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19358_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor411"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Creating a World of Your Own in Godot</em>, will kick off our own game project. We’ll start by defining what kind of game we will be making and progress to making the base of a player character and the environment in which they will be <span class="No-Break">moving around.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19358_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor523"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Making the Character Move</em>, offers a refresher on vector math, which is integral to moving entities around in two-dimensional space. Then, we’ll write the physics code to make our layer character move and go into debugging the game while it <span class="No-Break">is running.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19358_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor573"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Splitting and Reusing Scenes</em>, shows how we can easily split up our game into multiple smaller scenes that are easier to manage and maintain, followed by how we can organize all the scene and script files in tidy folders within <span class="No-Break">the project.</span></p>

After this, we’ll move on to handling collisions with the terrain and creating <span class="No-Break">collectible items.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19358_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor632"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Creating Menus, Making Enemies, and Using Autoloads</em>, finishes up our single-player game by teaching us about the menu system of the Godot Engine, followed by the creation of enemies that can navigate through the world and projectiles with which the player can shoot these enemies. We conclude this chapter with an introduction to autoloads, with which we can store the <span class="No-Break">high score.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19358_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor660"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Playing Together with Multiplayer,</em> converts our single-player experience into a multiplayer one. We start with a crash course in computer networking. After this, we will learn about <strong class="source-inline">MultiplayerSpawner</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">MultiplayerSynchronizer</strong> to be able to play our game with others over <span class="No-Break">a network.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19358_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor689"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Exporting to Multiple Platforms</em>, shows how we can export the game for different platforms such as Windows, macOS, Linux, and even the web.

			<p><a href="B19358_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor755"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">What Next?</em>, leaves us with some last techniques and resources to start the next game project as well as introduce the game development community we can be <span class="No-Break">part of.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>You don’t need any prior knowledge about programming or game development. The only prerequisite is that you are open to learning and willing to improve. During the book, I propose multiple experiments you could do and have included quizzes to test your knowledge. It’s important that you take the time to do these so that the knowledge gets cemented in <span class="No-Break">your brain.</span></p>
			<p>We’ll cover how to download and set up the Godot Engine in the first chapter of this book but you could already download Godot 4.2.1 or later if you’re feeling impatient. All the examples in the book were tested on Godot 4.2.1 but should work in future <span class="No-Break">versions too.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>Conventions used</h1>
			<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Code in text</strong>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: “In <a href="B19358_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, we learned to write code with the <strong class="source-inline">_ready</strong> method of <span class="No-Break">a node.”</span></p>
			<p>A block of code is set <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
func deal_damage(amount: float) -&gt; void:
   player_health -= amount
func heal(amount: float) -&gt; void:
   player_health += amount</pre>			<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set <span class="No-Break">in bold:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
func minimum(number1, number2):
   if number1 &lt; number2:
      <strong class="bold">return number1</strong>
   else:
      <strong class="bold">return number2</strong></pre>			<p>Any command-line input or output is written <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
unzip Godot_v4.2.1-stable_linux.x86_64.zip -d Godot</pre>			<p><strong class="bold">Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For instance, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in <strong class="bold">bold</strong>. Here is an example: “You can access the <strong class="source-inline">user://</strong> folder for a given project by opening up the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> menu and choosing <strong class="bold">Open User </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Data Folder</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.”</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Containers</p>
			<p class="callout">We call an array a <strong class="bold">container</strong> because we can store and retrieve pieces of data of other data types within them, like integers, strings, booleans, and such. An array contains other data.</p>
			<p class="callout">Containers structure other data so it is easier to work with.</p>
