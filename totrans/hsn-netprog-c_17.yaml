- en: Event-driven programming can provide the technique needed to simplify this logic
    a bit. Mainly, your program is structured so that a data structure is allocated
    to store information about each connection. Your program uses a main loop that
    checks for events, such as a readable or writable socket, and then handles those
    events. When structuring your program in this way, it is often easier to flag
    a connection as needing an action, rather than calling a function to process that
    action immediately.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The **Transmission Control Protocol** (**TCP**) is a fantastic protocol, and
    TCP sockets provide a beautiful abstraction. They present discrete packets on
    an unreliable network as a reliable, continuous stream of data. To the programmer,
    sending and receiving data from a peer anywhere in the world is made nearly as
    easy as reading and writing to a file.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: TCP works very well to hide network shortcomings. When a flaky network drops
    a few packets, TCP faithfully sorts out the mess and retransmits as needed. The
    application using TCP receives the data in perfect order. The application doesn't
    even know there was a network problem, and it certainly doesn't need to address
    the problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With this abstraction, like all abstractions, comes some inherent risk. TCP
    tries very hard to make networks look reliable. It usually succeeds, but sometimes,
    abstractions leak. What happens if your network cable is cut? What happens if
    the application you are connected to crashes? TCP isn't magic. It can't fix these
    problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Of course, it''s evident that the abstraction must break when faced with severe
    problems such as a total network outage. However, sometimes, more subtle problems
    can arise from details thought to be abstracted away. For example, what happens
    when you try to send a lot of data, but the peer that you are connected to isn''t
    reading it? (Answer: the data gets backed up.)'

    a TCP connection. Sometimes, that is what you want, but often it isn't.
  prefs: []

    we haven't lost data at the end of a connection. Details of how sockets are terminated
    can also cause operating systems to hold on to half-dead connections long after
    they've disconnected. These lingering sockets can prevent new programs from binding
    to their local ports.

- en: The standard TCP three-way handshake consists of three parts. First, the **Client**
    sends a **Synchronize (SYN)** message to the **Server**. Then the **Server** responds
    with anÂ **SYN Message** of its own, combined with an **Acknowledged** (**ACK**)
    message of the **Client**'s **SYN Message**. The **Client** then responds with
    an acknowledgment of the **Server**'s **SYN Message**. The connection is then
    open and ready for data transmission.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the `connect()` function is called on the **Client** side, the first **SYN
    Message** is sent, and the `connect()` function blocks until the **SYN+ACK Message**
    is received from the **Server**. After the **SYN+ACK Message** is received, `connect()`
    enqueues the final **ACK Message** and returns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This means that `connect()` blocks for at least one round-trip network time.
    That is, it blocks from the time that its **SYN Message** is sent to the time
    that the **SYN+ACK Message** is received. While one round-trip network time is
    the best-case scenario, in the worst case, it could block for much longer. Consider
    what happens when an overloaded **Server** receives anÂ **SYN Message**. The **Server**
    could take some time to reply with the **SYN+ACK Message**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If `connect()` cannot establish a connection successfully (that is, **SYN+ACK
    Message** is never received), then the `connect()` call eventually times out.
    This timeout period is controlled by the operating system. The exact timeout period
    varies, but 20 seconds is about typical.

    from [Chapter 3](eb2e080f-fad2-4e14-b4c1-9a6c124df77c.xhtml), *An In-Depth Overview

    work while waiting for the TCP connection to be established. That is, `select()`

    socket marked by `select()` as writable has connected successfully. Just try to
    use the socket. Most TCP client programs will want to call `send()` after connecting,
    anyway. The return value from this first `send()` call indicates whether you have
    a problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you really do want to try and determine the socket state without resorting
    to `send()`, you should be aware of some differences in how `select()` signals
    in this situation. On Unix-based systems, `select()` signals a socket as writable
    once the connection is established. If an error has occurred, `select()` signals
    the socket as both writable and readable. However, if the socket has connected
    successfully and data has arrived from the remote peer, this also produces both
    the readable and writable situation. In that case, the `getsockopt()` function
    can be used to determine whether an error has occurred. On Windows, `select()`
    marks a socket as excepted if an error occurred.

    A few segments are sent immediately, but additional segments aren't sent over
    the network until the first few segments are acknowledged as being received by

    requiring acknowledgment of receipt, imagine what happens if both parties to a
    TCP connection try to send a bunch of data at the same time. In this case, both
    parties send the first few TCP segments. They both then wait until their peer
    acknowledges receipt before sending more. However, if neither party is reading
    data, then neither party acknowledges receiving data. This is a deadlock state.
    Both parties are stuck waiting forever.

    alternate between sending and receiving data. For example, in HTTP, the client
    sends a request, and then the server sends a reply. The server only starts sending
    data after the client has finished sending.

    use UDP, where each packet stores a very short, time-stamped part of the video.

    request yet, so it cannot send a reply. After the delay period elapses, the **Server**

    few downsides. The only real drawback is that using `SO_REUSEADDR` allows your
    program to bind to a specific interface even if another program has already bound
    to the wildcard address. Usually, this isn't a problem, but it is something to
    keep in mind.

    in the `TIME-WAIT` state. This can be accomplished by setting the socket linger
    option. This is dangerous! The `TIME-WAIT` state is essential to TCP's reliability,
    and interfering with it can lead to severe problems.

    the problem manifests itself when calling `bind()`. Client programs don't usually

- en: A network outage prevents data from reaching your peer. In this case, TCP tries
    to retransmit data. If connectivity is re-established, TCP simply picks back up
    where it left off. Otherwise, the connection eventually times out. This timeout
    can be on the order of 10 minutes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second way a TCP connection can fail is if the connected peer application
    crashes. In this case, the peer's operating system sends a FIN message. This case
    is indistinguishable from the peer calling `close()` on their end. If your application
    continues to send data after having received the FIN message, the peer's system
    will send an RST message to indicate an error.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, a connection could fail because the peer's whole system has crashed.
    In this case, it won't be able to send a FIN message. This case looks the same
    as a network outage, and the TCP connection would eventually timeout. However,
    consider what happens if the crashed system reboots before the connection times
    out. In that case, the rebooted system will eventually receive a TCP message from
    the original connection. The rebooted system will not recognize the TCP connection
    and will send an RST message in response to indicate an error condition.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To reiterate, if you use `send()` on a socket that your peer thinks is closed,
    that peer will respond with an RST message. This state is easily detected by the
    return value of `recv()`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A more serious issue to consider is what happens when `send()` is called on
    a socket that has already received an RST message from its peer. On Unix-based
    systems, the default is to send a `SIGPIPE` signal to your program. If you don't
    handle this signal, the operating system will terminate your program.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    signal. Failure to handle this case means that a rude client could kill your server.
  prefs: []

    listening socket to a local address and port. If the socket isn't bound, then
    clients can't know where to connect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is also possible to use `bind()` on the client side to associate a socket
    with a particular address and port. It is sometimes useful to use `bind()` in
    this manner on machines that have multiple network interfaces. The use of `bind()`
    can allow the selection of which network address to use for the outgoing connection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes,Â `bind()` is used to set the local port for an outgoing connection.
    This is usually a bad idea for a few reasons. First, it very seldom serves any
    purpose. The port number presented to the connected server is likely to be different
    because of network address translation regardless. Binding to a local port also
    invites the error of selecting a port that is already in use. Usually, the operating
    system takes care of selecting a free port. This use of `bind()` also raises the
    issue with `TIME-WAIT`, which would prevent a new connection from being established
    after a closed one without a substantial delay.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have used `bind()` in this book mostly for binding servers to a particular
    port number. It can also be used to associate servers to a particular address.
    If a server has multiple network interfaces, it may be the case that you only
    care to listen on connections at one address. In this case, `bind()` can easily
    be used to limit the connections to that address. It can also be used to limit
    connections to the local machine by binding sockets to `127.0.0.1`. This can be
    an important security measure for some applications.
