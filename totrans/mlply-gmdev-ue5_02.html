<h1 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>Understanding Networking Basics</h1>
<p>Having a strong knowledge of networking is the foundation of any successful multiplayer game development, as it provides a basic understanding of how the different components that make up a network work. Networking can be divided into three main areas: logical architecture, protocols and standards, and physical infrastructure.</p>
<p>As it’s important for anyone interested in networked games to have at least some basic understanding of these concepts, the primary goal of this chapter is to introduce you to these components and the main issues that may pop up during multiplayer application development. By the end of the chapter, you will also get a grip on how the Unreal Engine multiplayer framework is organized in order to be prepared for the next step: creating your first multiplayer game prototype.</p>
<p>So, in this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is computer networking?</li>
<li>Introducing network protocols</li>
<li>Understanding network issues</li>
<li>Introducing the Unreal Engine multiplayer system</li>
</ul>

<p>There are no technical requirements to follow in this chapter.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>What is computer networking?</h1>
<p>We live in a world where we are constantly<a id="_idIndexMarker056"/> communicating with each other through computers, smartphones, smart homes, and a plethora of different devices. Computer networks are the backbone of modern technology.</p>
<p>Most people probably don’t even care about device communication and how it works; the most important thing is that... well, it works. But what exactly does <em class="italic">network</em> mean? And most importantly, as multiplayer game developers, what do we need to know about network systems?</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Computer networking</strong> involves two or more (most of the time, a lot more!) devices that are connected together with the common goal of sharing data and resources as fast and as reliably as possible.</p>
<p>A network can use cables (wired) or radio waves (wireless) and can cover a self-enclosed area or be available at a greater scale. Even if all these technologies share the same purpose, their structure and capabilities will vary significantly.</p>
<p>Once devices are physically connected, they must establish a “contract” in order to communicate securely; without such a contract, data could be sent to the wrong person and put important information at risk.</p>
<p>After the contract is established, each device can send data to another one using a “digital envelope” that identifies the sender and the receiver. This ensures that the data is only received by the intended recipient.</p>
<p>Dispatching data over the network can be very complex, especially when dealing with large files (think about an email with a 150 MB 3D model as an attachment and you’ll probably get the idea!). As a consequence, data must be “fragmented” into small pieces by the sender and, once it arrives at its destination, it will be re-packaged by the receiver, ready to be used.</p>
<p>This brings us to the last stage: losing information. Despite the advancements in technology, data loss is still a possibility in our imperfect world. Data can be corrupted or lost during transfer; therefore, it is important to take measures to ensure the safety of data and prevent such losses.</p>
<p>If things sound difficult, that's because they are! But don’t be afraid, that’s exactly how I felt when I started learning about this type of technology; as you make your way through this book, you will find that many of the topics have been handled by the UE multiplayer system, leaving<a id="_idIndexMarker057"/> you free to explore higher level topics.</p>
<p>In the next section, you will learn how a network, or a group of networks, is organized from a structural and operational perspective.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Types of computer networks</h1>
<p>As you already know, a computer network<a id="_idIndexMarker058"/> provides a way for multiple devices to communicate by sharing information with each other. Some well-known examples are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending emails</li>
<li>Streaming videos</li>
<li>...and guess what? Playing online games!</li>
</ul>
<p>But how are these devices connected? There are several different types of computer networks available that have different capabilities and purposes; depending on your needs (and your budget!), you’ll have to find a solution that will grant you reliability and trustworthiness.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>Local Area Networks</h2>
<p><strong class="bold">Local Area Networks</strong> (<strong class="bold">LANs</strong>) are probably the most common type<a id="_idIndexMarker059"/> of computer network. A LAN <a id="_idIndexMarker060"/>usually consists of a telecommunication network that connects devices that are situated at a close distance (usually no more than 1 kilometer). This type of network usually takes advantage of the fast connection over short distances granted by Ethernet cables.</p>
<p>A LAN<a id="_idIndexMarker061"/> can be of two types:</p>
<ul>
<li>A client/server LAN, where several devices (i.e., the clients) are connected to a centralized computer (i.e., the server)</li>
<li>A peer-to-peer LAN, where each device shares the network functionalities equally</li>
</ul>
<p><em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.1</em> illustrates a typical small-sized LAN where devices are connected through Wi-Fi or Ethernet cables.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.1 – A LAN setup" src="img/Figure_02_01_B18203.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.1 – A LAN setup</p>
<p>One of the main advantages of a LAN over a <strong class="bold">Wide Area Network</strong> (<strong class="bold">WAN</strong>) is the lower level of maintenance<a id="_idIndexMarker062"/> and reduced implementation costs. Also, since a LAN is limited to a relatively small distance and to a limited number of connected devices, it ensures a higher level of security.</p>
<p>Some good examples where LANs<a id="_idIndexMarker063"/> are used are academic campuses (sometimes called <strong class="bold">Campus Area Networks</strong>), hospitals, or offices with multiple departments.</p>
<p>A LAN can become a <strong class="bold">Wireless Local Area Network</strong> (<strong class="bold">WLAN</strong>) when connections between devices<a id="_idIndexMarker064"/> are only made wirelessly, and it is typically used in homes<a id="_idIndexMarker065"/> or public spaces (for example, libraries, airports, and cafes) where devices<a id="_idIndexMarker066"/> must connect without the need for physical cables.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Wide Area Networks</h2>
<p>The primary difference between a LAN and a WAN is that a WAN<a id="_idIndexMarker067"/> covers a much larger<a id="_idIndexMarker068"/> area and is essentially a collection of LANs connected together.</p>
<p>Similarly for the LAN, a WAN can be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A client/server WAN, where multiple devices are connected to a central computer</li>
<li>A peer-to-peer WAN, where each device shares an equal responsibility in the network functionalities</li>
</ul>
<p>As there is usually a loss in speed over long distances, a WAN is typically slower than a LAN. However, the main advantage of a WAN is the capability to be publicly owned: a good example is the internet, where no entity has full ownership.</p>
<p><em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.2</em> shows several LANs connected together through a WAN:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.2 – A WAN setup" src="img/Figure_02_02_B18203.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.2 – A WAN setup</p>
<p>A <strong class="bold">Metropolitan Area Network</strong> (<strong class="bold">MAN</strong>) is a smaller WAN usually managed<a id="_idIndexMarker069"/> by cities, regions, or governments; it typically includes a high-speed backbone network, which connects multiple LANs. As an example, it may connect multiple campuses belonging to the same academic<a id="_idIndexMarker070"/> institution (and that’s how it works where I am teaching right now!).</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Virtual Private Networks</h2>
<p>A <strong class="bold">Virtual Private Network</strong> (<strong class="bold">VPN</strong>) is a secure connection over the internet <a id="_idIndexMarker071"/>from a device to a network. By using secure<a id="_idIndexMarker072"/> encryption, data sent over a VPN is protected, preventing unauthorized tracking, protecting privacy, and bypassing geo-restrictions.</p>
<p><em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.3</em> shows an example where a device connected to a LAN is communicating over the internet with another device through a VPN.</p>

<p>In this section, you have been introduced to the fundamental principles of computer networking. You have explored how computer networks are structured and organized. In the following section, you will delve deeper into these topics to understand how devices communicate using rules and protocols, and how these rules guarantee the reliability and accuracy of the data that is exchanged.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Introducing network protocols</h1>
<p>To manage communication<a id="_idIndexMarker073"/> between two or more computers, we need some rules that will dictate how data is sent and received, as well as security measures<a id="_idIndexMarker074"/> that need to be taken to ensure reliability. These rules are called <strong class="bold">protocols</strong>.</p>
<p>Putting it simply, a protocol is like an international language: everyone needs to know the same words to communicate with one another. More specifically, a <strong class="bold">network protocol</strong> is a set of directives that rules how to <em class="italic">format</em>, <em class="italic">transmit</em>, and <em class="italic">receive</em> data so that devices in the same network can interact.</p>
<p>But before transmitting data over the network, it should be carefully packaged and structured so that the receiver can recognize and reassemble it.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Packet switching</h2>
<p><strong class="bold">Packet switching</strong> refers to the method of sending data to a network<a id="_idIndexMarker075"/> in the form of small<a id="_idIndexMarker076"/> portions (or <strong class="bold">packets</strong>). This process involves dividing data into small segments and adding an extra portion of information about the packet’s content, origin, and destination. This extra information is called a <strong class="bold">header</strong> and is typically placed at the front<a id="_idIndexMarker077"/> of each packet. In some cases, the packet may also include<a id="_idIndexMarker078"/> additional information at its end, referred to as a <strong class="bold">footer</strong>.</p>
<p>These packets are then sent over the network and reassembled at their destination. Along the way, they are processed by intermediate nodes, which can store incoming data and forward it to the next node closer to the final receiver.</p>
<p>Some of the advantages of using packet switching include efficiency in terms of bandwidth and reliability as the receiver can detect missing packages. Another advantage is cost-effectiveness due to relatively cheap implementation.</p>
<p>As an example, <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.4</em> shows a <strong class="bold">Transmission Control Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">TCP</strong>) packet composed of its header<a id="_idIndexMarker079"/> and data sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>The header is made of blocks of bits, each one with its own meaning (as an example, the <em class="italic">header length</em> tells the header data offset in order to specify where actual data will start in the sequence)</li>
<li>The data can be of varying lengths and holds the actual content included in the packet</li>
</ul>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.4 – A TCP packet" src="img/Figure_02_04_B18203.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.4 – A TCP packet</p>
<p>The collection of protocols<a id="_idIndexMarker080"/> that rule how data should<a id="_idIndexMarker081"/> be packaged and forwarded through the network is now known as the <strong class="bold">Internet Protocol Suite</strong> or the <strong class="bold">TCP/IP suite</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>TCP/IP suite</h2>
<p>The TCP/IP suite<a id="_idIndexMarker082"/> is made of different logical levels, or <strong class="bold">layers</strong>, that are stacked one above<a id="_idIndexMarker083"/> the other. These include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The application layer</li>
<li>The transport layer</li>
<li>The internet layer</li>
<li>The data link layer</li>
</ul>
<p><em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.5</em> shows the layers of the TCP/IP suite with some of the most commonly used protocols, along with the physical layer, which we will discuss later in this section:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.5 – TCP/IP layers" src="img/Figure_02_05_B18203.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.5 – TCP/IP layers</p>
<p>Each layer has an important role to play in supporting the needs of the one above it. As an example, this may involve accepting<a id="_idIndexMarker084"/> a block of data from the layer above, processing it according to the current <a id="_idIndexMarker085"/>layer’s protocols, and then sending it to the layer below.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at each of these layers now.</p>
<h3>The application layer</h3>
<p>The <strong class="bold">application layer</strong> provides the interface for communication<a id="_idIndexMarker086"/> between applications<a id="_idIndexMarker087"/> running on different machines on the network. It stands at the very top of the TCP/IP suite <a id="_idIndexMarker088"/>and allows the sharing of data through the use of protocols, such as the <strong class="bold">File Transfer Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">FTP</strong>) and the <strong class="bold">HyperText Transfer Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">HTTP</strong>), which are used to upload files to the internet<a id="_idIndexMarker089"/> and download web pages on your favorite browser.</p>
<h3>The transport layer</h3>
<p>The <strong class="bold">transport layer</strong> is responsible for providing reliable data delivery <a id="_idIndexMarker090"/>and flow control and provides<a id="_idIndexMarker091"/> services that allow applications to communicate securely over the network.</p>
<p>While TCP is commonly used for its reliability, there are situations where other protocols<a id="_idIndexMarker092"/> are preferred for their speed, such as the <strong class="bold">User Data Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">UDP</strong>), which won’t ensure packet delivery but will be faster as it doesn’t require the overheads associated with establishing and maintaining a connection.</p>
<p>This layer is typically responsible for detecting issues and verifying<a id="_idIndexMarker093"/> data integrity; one way is through <strong class="bold">checksums</strong>, or sequences of numbers and letters<a id="_idIndexMarker094"/> used to check<a id="_idIndexMarker095"/> data for errors.</p>
<h3>The internet layer</h3>
<p>The <strong class="bold">internet layer</strong> (or, more generically, the <strong class="bold">network layer</strong> in the TCP/IP suite) is responsible<a id="_idIndexMarker096"/> for providing the means<a id="_idIndexMarker097"/> to route data between<a id="_idIndexMarker098"/> different networks and ensure that packets are delivered correctly. This layer also provides various services such as addressing, routing, congestion control, and flow control.</p>
<p>The internet layer is responsible for providing a logical addressing system that allows hosts to be easily replaced, groups of hosts to be organized into subnets, and distant subnets to be able to communicate with one another.</p>
<p>The most common<a id="_idIndexMarker099"/> protocol used to implement these features is <strong class="bold">Internet Protocol Version 4</strong> (<strong class="bold">IPv4</strong>), which is a 32-bit address that identifies a device on a network. The most recent release, <strong class="bold">Internet Protocol Version 6 </strong>(<strong class="bold">IPv6</strong>), is based on a 128-bit address and is designed to replace IPv4, as that <a id="_idIndexMarker100"/>one is running out of available addresses.</p>
<h3>The data link layer</h3>
<p>The <strong class="bold">data link layer</strong> is responsible for providing a method<a id="_idIndexMarker101"/> for communication between physically<a id="_idIndexMarker102"/> connected hosts. This means this layer must provide a method through which a source host can package up information and transmit it through the physical layer.</p>
<p><em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.6</em> depicts a typical communication flow between two devices, a client and a server, and the data passing through the different layers:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.6 – The communication between a client and a server" src="img/Figure_02_06_B18203.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.6 – The communication between a client and a server</p>
<h3>The physical layer</h3>
<p>Underneath<a id="_idIndexMarker103"/> all of the previous layers is the <strong class="bold">physical layer</strong>, which is responsible for actually<a id="_idIndexMarker104"/> sending raw data (bits) over a physical medium, such as a cable, an optical fiber, a Wi-Fi connection, or even a Bluetooth communication.</p>
<p>This layer defines how signals are sent and received, as well as how these signals are modulated and demodulated into usable digital information.</p>
<p>Though we have discussed the physical layer here, it is not actually included in the TCP/IP suite, which is why it is slightly separated from the other layers shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.5</em>.</p>
<p>Now that you know how data is packaged and how the TCP/IP suite is organized, you will learn about the main problems and pitfalls that can happen over the network in the next section.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Understanding network issues</h1>
<p>With so much data involved<a id="_idIndexMarker105"/> and moving around physical media, there is a significant risk of running into serious issues. As such, it is important to be aware of these potential problems and how to best avoid them or limit their impact.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>Security</h2>
<p>The first issue <a id="_idIndexMarker106"/>to consider when dealing with computer networking is <strong class="bold">security</strong>. Without proper security protocols<a id="_idIndexMarker107"/> in place, it’s possible for malicious people to gain access to sensitive information.</p>
<p>Getting your credit card information stolen while in-app purchasing the latest skin for your character or your login credentials stolen from your Steam account is something you definitely don’t want to experience!</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Packet loss</h2>
<p><strong class="bold">Packet loss</strong> occurs when data packets sent from one device<a id="_idIndexMarker108"/> to another are lost or corrupted <a id="_idIndexMarker109"/>and is a major issue that can cause significant disruption to any network. This type of disruption can lead to a slow or even complete breakdown in communication, resulting in a negative gaming experience for players.</p>
<p>Consider, for instance, if your perfect shoot at a berserker opponent who is trying to leap at you is lost over the network: you would be in a great deal of trouble at that moment!</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>Latency</h2>
<p><strong class="bold">Latency</strong> in computer networking is represented <a id="_idIndexMarker110"/>by the time it takes for a data packet<a id="_idIndexMarker111"/> to travel from one designated point to its destination and is usually measured in milliseconds. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as slow internet connections, outdated hardware, or congested networks.</p>
<p>In a multiplayer game, latency should be kept as low as possible as it can have a significant impact on the performance of the game you are playing. As an example, in a first-person shooter game where fast reflexes are essential, having your character killed due to a slow connection can ruin all the fun!</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">While dealing with security and data loss are not topics discussed in this book, you’ll learn about latency and how to handle it in <em class="italic">Part 4</em> of this book. However, if you are interested in delving deeper<a id="_idIndexMarker112"/> into the topics of network security and data loss, Packt offers an extensive collection<a id="_idIndexMarker113"/> of books on the subject.</p>
<p>Now that you have a basic grip on the main issues when managing data over the network, it’s time to move into Unreal Engine and get an introduction to how this software handles networking.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Introducing the Unreal Engine multiplayer system</h1>
<p>As we already saw in the previous sections, in a networked system, it is essential to consider what data is sent and how it is sent, as this can drastically influence the performance and overall experience of the game.</p>
<p>Unreal Engine features a powerful networking framework, which is used in some of the most popular online games in the world. This section provides an overview of the concepts that power the Unreal Engine multiplayer framework, as well as their usage in multiplayer gameplay.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>Network modes and server types</h2>
<p>In Unreal Engine, a computer’s relationship<a id="_idIndexMarker114"/> to a multiplayer session is referred to as a <strong class="bold">network mode</strong>. An Unreal game <a id="_idIndexMarker115"/>can be set as one<a id="_idIndexMarker116"/> of the following network modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Client</strong>: In this mode, the computer will act as a client, connecting to a server in a network multiplayer session.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Standalone</strong>: This mode is strictly used for non-networked games (single players or local multiplayer) and will not accept any connections from remote clients.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Dedicated Server</strong>: In this mode, the computer will run as a server hosting a network multiplayer session and will accept connections from remote clients. As a dedicated server, everything will be optimized for persistent and secure management, so will ignore any player-oriented features, such as graphics, audio, or input.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Listen Server</strong>: In this mode, the computer will run as a server accepting remote clients, but also local players. This means it will sacrifice some performance, but will allow a computer to act both as a server and as a client. This mode<a id="_idIndexMarker117"/> can be thought of as a combination of the client and dedicated server modes, allowing you to participate in a game<a id="_idIndexMarker118"/> as a client while simultaneously<a id="_idIndexMarker119"/> hosting the network.</li>
</ul>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">Listen servers have gained popularity due to their ease of setup and ability to provide both casual and competitive multiplayer gaming in a LAN. As players hosting the session will be playing directly on the server, they will usually have an advantage over the other players. However, as servers are also run as clients, they are not suitable for highly competitive games or games with a large amount of data involved. Additionally, listen servers, which allow a client to host a game and have other clients join to play, create potential vulnerabilities for all clients on the network. This is because the client hosting the network may engage in malicious actions, such as cheating or granting themselves an unfair advantage over other players.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>The replication system</h2>
<p>In UE, the process<a id="_idIndexMarker120"/> of reproducing game state<a id="_idIndexMarker121"/> information between the server and clients is called <strong class="bold">replication</strong>. The replication system allows for high-level abstraction and low-level customization, making it simpler to manage any scenarios that may arise when creating an Unreal Engine project intended for multiple users at once.</p>
<p>If replication is enabled on an Actor, all instances of the game running on different machines will be synchronized. On the other hand, if replication is disabled, the Actor will only update its functions on the machine where it was spawned.</p>
<p>Some of the most common elements that you will probably replicate during a multiplayer game development may be creation/destruction, movement, variables, and components.</p>
<p>There are, however, other elements<a id="_idIndexMarker122"/> that should not be replicated at all as they will be running separately on the client, such as skeletal and static meshes, materials, particle systems, and sound<a id="_idIndexMarker123"/> emitters. Usually, the server does not need to know about these kinds of things, considering the nature of these elements (i.e., purely aesthetical).</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Network role</h2>
<p>When playing<a id="_idIndexMarker124"/> a game online with multiple players, it is important to understand which device is in control of each Actor. This is determined by the network role of the Actor itself.</p>
<p>The device with an <strong class="bold">authoritative</strong> Actor role is the one that has<a id="_idIndexMarker125"/> control of the Actor’s state, and it is responsible for replicating information about the Actor to other players in real time.</p>
<p>A copy of the same Actor<a id="_idIndexMarker126"/> located on a remote machine that is not authoritative is defined as a <strong class="bold">remote proxy</strong> and will receive all replicated information from the authoritative one.</p>
<p>In UE, the authority is typically held<a id="_idIndexMarker127"/> by the server, meaning that information is usually <em class="italic">from</em> the server <em class="italic">to</em> the clients. This model is known as <strong class="bold">server-authoritative</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Pawns and PlayerControllers</h2>
<p>As you may already<a id="_idIndexMarker128"/> know, in UE, a Pawn (or, more often, a Character) can be owned<a id="_idIndexMarker129"/> by a PlayerController. This is also true for multiplayer games, where a PlayerController is created for each connected player.</p>
<p>During gameplay, any Actor that has been assigned to a particular Pawn is automatically associated with that Pawn’s owning client. As an example, a Pawn may possess an item such as a rifle or a sword Actor, and this item will be held owned by the same connection<a id="_idIndexMarker130"/> that owns<a id="_idIndexMarker131"/> the Pawn.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>Relevance and priority</h2>
<p>To determine <a id="_idIndexMarker132"/>whether it is beneficial to replicate an Actor during a multiplayer game, <strong class="bold">relevance</strong> is taken into account. Actors that are deemed not relevant will be excluded during replication. This method is used to reduce the amount of data that is sent over the network, thereby increasing the efficiency of data replication.</p>
<p>When bandwidth is limited, the most<a id="_idIndexMarker133"/> important Actors are selected first when replicating data. Each Actor has an assigned <strong class="bold">priority</strong> value, which is used to determine the order of replication.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Remote Procedure Calls</h2>
<p>During a multiplayer<a id="_idIndexMarker134"/> session, a function can be replicated through a <strong class="bold">Remote Procedure Call</strong> (<strong class="bold">RPC</strong>). RPCs can be invoked from any machine<a id="_idIndexMarker135"/> connected to the network, but their implementation will take place on a particular machine that is part of the network session.</p>
<p>An RPC can be sent from the server, the client, or to multiple clients (<strong class="bold">multicast</strong>). An RPC can either be guaranteed to reach its destination (<strong class="bold">reliable</strong>) or not (<strong class="bold">unreliable</strong>).</p>
<p>In this section, I provided some of the key definitions regarding the UE multiplayer system. The information here may seem quite dense and things may seem a bit overwhelming. But don’t be afraid – you just finished the second chapter and the entire book is available to help you learn it all!</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, you learned about the fundamental concepts of computer networking and the key players involved in successful network communication. Additionally, you were introduced to the Internet Protocol and the layers that make up the TCP/IP suite with the main issues that may arise during a network connection. Finally, you were presented with the Unreal multiplayer system and the key features offered by the framework.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, you will start to gain practical experience with UE by building a prototype of a multiplayer game and testing its features on your computer.</p>
