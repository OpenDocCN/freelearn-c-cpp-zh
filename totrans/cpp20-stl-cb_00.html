			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>About this book</h1>
			<p>The <em class="italic">C++20 STL Cookbook</em> provides recipes to help you get the most out of the C++ STL (Standard Template Library), including new features introduced with C++20. </p>
			<p>C++ is a rich and powerful language. Built upon C, with syntactic extensions for type safety, generic programming, and object-oriented programming, C++ is essentially a low-level language. The STL provides a broad set of higher-level classes, functions, and algorithms to make your programming job easier, more effective, and less prone to error. </p>
			<p>I've often said that C++ is five languages cobbled into one. The formal specification includes 1) the entire <em class="italic">C language</em>, 2) C's cryptic-yet-powerful <em class="italic">macro preprocessor</em>, 3) a feature-rich <em class="italic">class/object</em> model, 4) a <em class="italic">generic programming</em> model called <em class="italic">templates</em>, and finally, built upon C++ classes and templates, 5) the <em class="italic">STL</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Prerequisite knowledge</h2>
			<p>This book presumes that you have a basic understanding of C++, including syntax, structure, data types, classes and objects, templates, and the STL.</p>
			<p>The recipes and examples in this book presume that you understand the need to <code>#include</code> certain headers to use library functions. The recipes don't usually list all the necessary headers, preferring to focus on the techniques at hand. You're encouraged to download the example code, which has all the necessary <code>#include</code> directives and other front matter.</p>
			<p>You may download the example code from GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/CPP-20-STL-Cookbook">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/CPP-20-STL-Cookbook</a>.</p>
			<p>These assumptions mean that when you see a piece of code like this:</p>
			<pre>cout &lt;&lt; "hello, world\n";</pre>
			<p>You should already know that you'll need to put this code in a <code>main()</code> function, you'll need to <code>#include</code> the <code>&lt;iostream&gt;</code> header, and <code>cout</code> is an object in the <code>std::</code> namespace:</p>
			<pre><strong class="bold">#include</strong> &lt;iostream&gt;
int <strong class="bold">main()</strong> {
    <strong class="bold">std::cout</strong> &lt;&lt; "hello, world\n";
}</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>The STL's power is derived from templates <em class="italic">(a brief primer)</em></h2>
			<p><em class="italic">Templates</em> are how C++ does <em class="italic">generic programming</em>, code that's independent of type while retaining type safety. C++ templates allow you to use tokens as placeholders for types and classes, like this: </p>
			<pre>template&lt;typename T&gt;
T add_em_up(T&amp; lhs, T&amp; rhs) {
    return lhs + rhs;
}</pre>
			<p>A template may be used for classes and/or functions. In this template function, the <code>T</code> represents a <em class="italic">generic type</em>, which allows this code to be used in the context of any compatible class or type:</p>
			<pre>int a{ 72 };  // see <strong class="bold">braced initialization</strong> below
int b{ 47 };
cout &lt;&lt; <strong class="bold">add_em_up&lt;int&gt;(a, b)</strong> &lt;&lt; "\n";</pre>
			<p>This invokes the template function with an <code>int</code> type. This same code can be used with any type or class that supports the <code>+</code> operator.</p>
			<p>When the compiler sees a <em class="italic">template invocation</em>, like <code>add_em_up&lt;int&gt;(a, b)</code>, it creates a <em class="italic">specialization</em>. This is what makes the code type safe. When you invoke <code>add_em_up()</code> with an <code>int</code> type, the specialization will look something like this: </p>
			<pre><strong class="bold">int</strong> add_em_up(<strong class="bold">int</strong>&amp; lhs, <strong class="bold">int</strong>&amp; rhs) {
    return lhs + rhs;
}</pre>
			<p>The specialization takes the template and replaces all instances of the <code>T</code> placeholder with the type from the invocation, in this case, <code>int</code>. The compiler creates a separate specialization of the template each time it's invoked with a different type. </p>
			<p>STL <em class="italic">containers</em>, like <code>vector</code>, <code>stack</code>, or <code>map</code>, along with their <em class="italic">iterators</em> and other supporting functions and algorithms, are built with templates so they can be used generically while maintaining type safety. This is what makes the STL so flexible. Templates are the <em class="italic">T</em> in the STL. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>This book uses the C++20 standard</h2>
			<p>The C++ language is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) on a roughly three-year cycle. The current standard is called C++20 (which was preceded by C++17, C++14, and C++11 before that). C++20 was approved in September 2020. </p>
			<p>C++20 adds many important features to the language and the STL. New features like <em class="italic">format</em>, <em class="italic">modules</em>, <em class="italic">ranges</em>, and more will have significant impact on the way we use the STL.</p>
			<p>There are also convenience changes. For example, if you want to remove every matching element of a <code>vector</code>, you may have been using the <em class="italic">erase-remove idiom</em> like this:</p>
			<pre>auto it = std::remove(vec1.begin(), vec1.end(), value);
vec1.erase(it, vec1.end());</pre>
			<p>Starting with C++20 you can use the new <code>std::erase</code> function and do all of that in one simple, optimized function call: </p>
			<pre>std::erase(vec1, value);</pre>
			<p>C++20 has many improvements, both subtle and substantial. In this book, we will cover much of it, especially what's relevant to the STL. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>Braced initialization</h2>
			<p>You may notice that the recipes in this book often use <em class="italic">braced initialization</em> in place of the more familiar <em class="italic">copy initialization</em>. </p>
			<pre>std::string name{ "Jimi Hendrix" };  // braced initialization
std::string name = "Jimi Hendrix";   // copy initialization</pre>
			<p>The <code>=</code> operator pulls double-duty as both an assignment and a copy operator. It's common, familiar, and it works, so we've all been using it forever. </p>
			<p>The downside of the <code>=</code> operator is that it's also a copy constructor, which often means <em class="italic">implicit narrowing conversion</em>. This is both inefficient and can lead to unintended type conversions, which can be difficult to debug. </p>
			<p>Braced initialization uses the list initialization operator <code>{}</code> (introduced in C++11) to avoid those side effects. It's a good habit to get into and you'll see it a lot in this book.</p>
			<p>It's also worth noting that the special case of <code>T{}</code> is guaranteed to be zero-initialized. </p>
			<pre>int x;      // uninitialized            bad  :(
int x = 0;  // zero (copy constructed)  good :)
int x{};    // zero (zero-initialized)  best :D</pre>
			<p>The empty brace zero initialization offers a useful shortcut for initializing new variables.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-11"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>Hiding the std:: namespace</h2>
			<p>In most instances, the exercises in this book will hide the <code>std::</code> namespace. This is mostly for page space and readability considerations. We all know that most STL identifiers are in the <code>std::</code> namespace. I will normally use some form of the <code>using</code> declaration to avoid cluttering the examples with repetitive prefixes. For example, when using <code>cout</code> you can presume I've included a <code>using</code> declaration like this:</p>
			<pre>using std::cout;    // cout is now sans prefix
cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, Jimi!\n"; </pre>
			<p>I usually <em class="italic">will not show</em> the <code>using</code> declaration in the recipe listings. This allows us to focus on the purpose of the example.</p>
			<p>It is poor practice to import the entire <code>std::</code> namespace in your code. You should <em class="italic">avoid</em> a <code>using namespace</code> declaration like this: </p>
			<pre>using namespace std;    // bad. don't do that. 
cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, Jimi!\n"; </pre>
			<p>The <code>std::</code> namespace includes thousands of identifiers and there's no good reason to clutter your namespace with them. The potential for collisions is not trivial, and can be hard to track down. When you want to use a name without the <code>std::</code> prefix, the preferred method is to import a single name at a time, as above. </p>
			<p>To further avoid namespace collisions, I often use a separate namespace for classes that will be re-used. I tend to use <code>namespace bw</code> for my personal namespace. You may use something else that works for you.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-12"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>Type aliases with using</h2>
			<p>This book uses the <code>using</code> directive for type aliases instead of <code>typedef</code>. </p>
			<p>STL classes and types can be verbose at times. A templated iterator class, for example, may look like this:</p>
			<pre>std::vector&lt;std::pair&lt;int,std::string&gt;&gt;::iterator</pre>
			<p>Long type names are not just hard to type, they are prone to error. </p>
			<p>One common technique is to abbreviate long type names with <code>typedef</code>:</p>
			<pre>typedef std::vector&lt;std::pair&lt;int,std::string&gt;&gt;::iterator <strong class="bold">vecit_t</strong></pre>
			<p>This declares an alias for our unwieldy iterator type. <code>typedef</code> is inherited from C and its syntax reflects that. </p>
			<p>Beginning with C+11, the <code>using</code> keyword may be used to create a type alias:</p>
			<pre>using <strong class="bold">vecit_t</strong> = std::vector&lt;std::pair&lt;int,std::string&gt;&gt;::iterator;</pre>
			<p>In most circumstances, a <code>using</code> alias is equivalent to <code>typedef</code>. The most significant difference is that a <code>using</code> alias may be templated: </p>
			<pre>template&lt;typename T&gt;
using v = std::vector&lt;T&gt;;
v&lt;int&gt; x{};</pre>
			<p>For these reasons, and for the sake of clarity, this book prefers the <code>using</code> directive for type aliases.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-13"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"/>Abbreviated function templates</h2>
			<p>Beginning with C++20, an <em class="italic">abbreviated function template</em> may be specified without the template header. For example:</p>
			<pre>void printc(const <strong class="bold">auto</strong>&amp; c) {
    for (auto i : c) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
}</pre>
			<p>The <code>auto</code> type in a parameter list works like an anonymous template <code>typename</code>. It is equivalent to:</p>
			<pre>template&lt;<strong class="bold">typename C</strong>&gt;
void printc(const <strong class="bold">C</strong>&amp; c) {
    for (auto i : c) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
}</pre>
			<p>Though new in C++20, abbreviated function templates have been supported by the major compilers for some time already. This book will use abbreviated function templates in many of the examples.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-14"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"/>The C++20 format() function</h2>
			<p>Until C++20 we've had a choice of using legacy <code>printf()</code> or the STL <code>cout</code> for formatting text. Both have serious flaws but we've used them because they work. Beginning with C++20, the <code>format()</code> function provides text formatting inspired by Python 3's formatter. </p>
			<p>This course uses the new STL <code>format()</code> function liberally. Please see <a href="B18267_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor027"><em class="italic">Chaper 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">New C++20 Features</em>, for a more comprehensive description. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-15"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"/>Use the STL to solve real-world problems</h2>
			<p>The recipes in this book use the STL to provide real-world solutions to real-world problems. They have been designed to rely exclusively on the STL and C++ standard libraries, with no external libraries. This should make it easy for you to experiment and learn without the distractions of installing and configuring third-party code. </p>
			<p>Now, let's go have some fun with the STL. <em class="italic">Happy learning!</em> </p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>The recipes in this book use the GCC compiler</h2>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, most of the recipes in this book have been developed and tested using the GCC compiler, version 11.2, the latest stable version as of this writing. </p>
			<p>As I write this, C++20 is still new and is not fully implemented on any available compiler. Of the three major compilers, <em class="italic">GCC</em> (GNU), <em class="italic">MSVC</em> (Microsoft), and <em class="italic">Clang</em> (Apple), the MSVC compiler is furthest along in implementing the new standard. Occasionally, we may run into a feature that is implemented on MSVC or another compiler, but not on GCC, in which case I will note which compiler I used. If a feature is not yet implemented on any available compiler, I will explain that I was unable to test it.</p>
			<p class="figure-caption"><img src="img/B18267_Preface_01.png" alt=""/></p>
			<p>I strongly recommend that you install GCC to follow along with the recipes in this book. GCC is freely available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). The easiest way to get the latest version of GCC is to install <em class="italic">Debian Linux</em> (also GPL) and use <code>apt</code> with the <code>testing</code> repository.</p>
