Coupled with Qt, you have in your hands a cross-platform framework that allies performance and ease of use. Qt is a vast framework that provides tools in many areas (GUI, threads, networking, and so on). 25 years after its inception, Qt continues to evolve and grow with each release.</p><p>This book aims to teach you how to squeeze the best out of Qt with the new C++14 additions (lambdas, smart pointers, enum classes, and so on). These two technologies together bring you a safe and powerful development toolbox. Throughout the book, we try to emphasize a clean architecture that lets you create and maintain your application in a complex environment.</p><p>Each chapter is based on an example project that is the basis of all the discussion. Here are some tasters about what we will see in this book:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Uncover qmake secrets</li><li class="listitem">Take a deep dive in the model/view  architecture and study how you can build a complex application with this pattern</li><li class="listitem">Study QML and Qt Quick applications in mobile</li><li class="listitem">Develop Qt 3D components using QML and JavaScript</li><li class="listitem">Show how to develop plugins and SDKs using Qt</li><li class="listitem">Cover the multi-threading technologies provided by Qt</li><li class="listitem">Build an IPC mechanism using sockets</li><li class="listitem">Serialize data using XML, JSON, and binary format</li></ul></div><p>We'll cover all this and much, much more.</p><p>Note that you can take a look at <a class="link" title="Chapter 14. Qt Hat Tips and Tricks" href="part0130.xhtml#aid-3RV941">Chapter 14</a>, <em>Qt Hat Tips and Tricks</em>, whenever you want if you want to get some development candies and see some code snippets that might make your development more pleasurable.</p><p>And most importantly, have fun writing Qt applications!</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf07lvl1sec1"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 1.  Get Your Qt Feet Wet" href="part0014.xhtml#aid-DB7S1">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Get</em> <em>Your Qt Feet Wet</em>, lays the fundamentals of Qt and refreshes your memory with a todo application.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf07lvl1sec2"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>All the code in this book can be compiled and run from Qt Creator using Qt 5.7. You can do it from your preferred OS: Windows, Linux, or Mac OS.</p><p>About the mobile-specific chapters, either an Android or an iOS device works, but it is not mandatory (the simulator/emulator can be enough).</p><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 6.  Even Qt Deserves a Slice of Raspberry Pi" href="part0060.xhtml#aid-1P71O2">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Even Qt Deserves a Slice of Raspberry Pi</em>, offers to build an application running on a Raspberry Pi. Although it is more fun if we can do it with a real Raspberry Pi, it is not necessary to have one to complete the chapter.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf07lvl1sec3"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book will appeal to developers and programmers who would like to build GUI-based application.

Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "The <code class="literal">qmake</code> command is executed with the project <code class="literal">.pro</code> file."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">void MemoryWidget::updateSeries()&#13;
{&#13;
    double memoryUsed = SysInfo::instance().memoryUsed();&#13;
    mSeries-&gt;append(mPointPositionX++, memoryUsed);&#13;
    if (mSeries-&gt;count() &gt; CHART_X_RANGE_COUNT) {&#13;

        mSeries-&gt;remove(0);&#13;
    }&#13;
}</pre><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><pre class="programlisting">windows {&#13;

</pre><p><strong>New terms </strong>and <strong>important words </strong>are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "In Qt Creator, when you click on the <strong>Build</strong> button, qmake is invoked."</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note1"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip2"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div>
