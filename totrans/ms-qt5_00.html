Coupled with Qt, you have in your hands a cross-platform framework that allies performance and ease of use. Qt is a vast framework that provides tools in many areas (GUI, threads, networking, and so on). 25 years after its inception, Qt continues to evolve and grow with each release.</p><p>This book aims to teach you how to squeeze the best out of Qt with the new C++14 additions (lambdas, smart pointers, enum classes, and so on). These two technologies together bring you a safe and powerful development toolbox. Throughout the book, we try to emphasize a clean architecture that lets you create and maintain your application in a complex environment.</p><p>Each chapter is based on an example project that is the basis of all the discussion. Here are some tasters about what we will see in this book:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Uncover qmake secrets</li><li class="listitem">Take a deep dive in the model/view  architecture and study how you can build a complex application with this pattern</li><li class="listitem">Study QML and Qt Quick applications in mobile</li><li class="listitem">Develop Qt 3D components using QML and JavaScript</li><li class="listitem">Show how to develop plugins and SDKs using Qt</li><li class="listitem">Cover the multi-threading technologies provided by Qt</li><li class="listitem">Build an IPC mechanism using sockets</li><li class="listitem">Serialize data using XML, JSON, and binary format</li></ul></div><p>We'll cover all this and much, much more.</p><p>Note that you can take a look at <a class="link" title="Chapter 14. Qt Hat Tips and Tricks" href="part0130.xhtml#aid-3RV941">Chapter 14</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Qt Hat Tips and Tricks</em></span>, whenever you want if you want to get some development candies and see some code snippets that might make your development more pleasurable.</p><p>And most importantly, have fun writing Qt applications!</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf07lvl1sec1"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 1.  Get Your Qt Feet Wet" href="part0014.xhtml#aid-DB7S1">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Get</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>Your Qt Feet Wet</em></span>, lays the fundamentals of Qt and refreshes your memory with a todo application.
