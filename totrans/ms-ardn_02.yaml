    was seven or eight years old, I can remember taking apart a hand-held transistor
    radio and struggling for several days to put it back together without letting
    my parents know I took it apart. Even though I would take little devices apart
    and put them back together, I really did not understand basic electronics until
    I took a basic electronics course in high school. That class gave me enough knowledge
    to begin to understand how the electronic devices that I have been taking apart
    actually worked. It also laid the foundation for all electronic projects that
    I have done since.

    current** (**DC**), which is different from the **alternating current** (**AC**)
    that comes from wall outlets. DC current is the flow of electrical charge in one
    direction while AC current changes direction periodically. We only cover DC current
    in this book because it is inherently safer than AC current and the Arduino with
    its components are powered by DC power sources. We can power the Arduino by plugging
    a power adapter into a wall, as we saw in [Chapter 1](a46a0d68-6899-45e9-8f90-3ba0f15ad9e6.xhtml), *The

- en: Most of the low-cost resistors that we can get from online retailers are rated
    at 1/4 (or 0.25) Watts so we will assume that the resistors we are using for the
    projects in this book are rated at that 1/4 Watt. Now let's say in our project
    we are running a voltage of 10V across a 100 Ohm resistor, do you think the resistor
    will be able to handle it? To figure this out, the first thing we need to do is
    to calculate the current using Ohm's law. We will use the formula *I *= *V*/*R*
    to calculate the current (*I *= 10V/100 Ohms) and come up with a current of 0.1
    Amps. We can now use the formula *P *= *V***I* to calculate the power (*P*=0.1A
    * 10V) which would equal 1 Watt, which is four times what the resistor is rated
    for, therefore the resistor will get very hot and may even get damaged.

    of the resistors contain four bands but there are also some resistors that have
    five and six bands. The following picture shows what a resistor with four bands

    the resistor''s value. The third band is the multiplier and the fourth band is
    the tolerance. Resistors that have five bands use the first three bands to indicate
    the resistor''s value, then the fourth band is the multiplier and the fifth band
    is the tolerance. The following table shows the color values:'

- en: The resistor pictured the beginning of this section has four bands coloured
    Yellow-Violet-Orange-Silver, which means the resistor is a 47K Ohm with 10% tolerance.
    We know this because the first two bands (Yellow and Violet) have values of 4
    and 7\. We then use the third band (Orange) as the multiplier which is 1K. This
    gives us a resistance value of 47 multiplied by 1K or 47K. The fourth band (Silver)
    indicates a tolerance of 10%.

- en: In this chapter, we gave a very brief introduction to electricity and some of
    the more popular electronic components that we will be using later in this book.
    This chapter will give you enough knowledge to get you started building very basic
    prototypes. It is recommended that once you start more advanced projects you do
    further reading on electricity and electronic components.
