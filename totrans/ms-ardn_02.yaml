    was seven or eight years old, I can remember taking apart a hand-held transistor
    radio and struggling for several days to put it back together without letting
    my parents know I took it apart. Even though I would take little devices apart
    and put them back together, I really did not understand basic electronics until
    I took a basic electronics course in high school. That class gave me enough knowledge
    to begin to understand how the electronic devices that I have been taking apart
    actually worked. It also laid the foundation for all electronic projects that
    I have done since.

    details of the electronics to let the user focus on their project, we still need
    a basic understanding of electronics and electricity to connect external components
    to the Arduino board and to make sure we do not damage the board with those components.
    This chapter, along with [Chapter 3](de9d9edf-fdf1-410b-bb8a-98ef4b185166.xhtml),
    *Circuit Diagrams* and [Chapter 4](f0039485-e47c-40c8-9130-fba1e1afd421.xhtml),
    *Basic Prototyping*, are designed to give you a basic understanding of electronics,
    electricity, and circuits so you can build your own prototypes and work with the
    examples in the later chapters of this book.

    current** (**DC**), which is different from the **alternating current** (**AC**)
    that comes from wall outlets. DC current is the flow of electrical charge in one
    direction while AC current changes direction periodically. We only cover DC current
    in this book because it is inherently safer than AC current and the Arduino with
    its components are powered by DC power sources. We can power the Arduino by plugging
    a power adapter into a wall, as we saw in [Chapter 1](a46a0d68-6899-45e9-8f90-3ba0f15ad9e6.xhtml), *The
    Arduino*; however, the power adapter converts the AC power source to a DC power
    source.

    charges attract each other while particles with the same charge repel each other.

    from its atom and joins another atom. The atom that the electron escaped from
    now will have a net positive charge while the atom that gained the electron while
    having a net negative charge. Electricity is this flow of electrons.

    can escape from its atom. Copper, Silver, and Gold are some of the best conductive
    materials because they have only a single valence, or outer shell, an electron
    that moves with little resistance.

    attract therefor the positively charged end attracts the electrons causing them
    to flow from the negatively charged end. One of the easiest ways to envision the
    flow of electrons is to look at how water flows through a pipe. Now let's look

- en: Power is the amount of electrical energy transformed into another type of energy
    (heat, light or work) per second. Power is an important concept because it is
    what allows our electric circuit to do something. For example, if we created a
    circuit with a battery and a resistor, the resistor will convert the electrical
    energy to heat (or thermal) energy. All resistors also have a maximum power rating
    that they can handle therefore to ensure that we do not damage the resistors in
    a circuit we will need to know how to calculate power. Power is calculated by
    multiplying the voltage by the current and is measured in Watts.

    at 1/4 (or 0.25) Watts so we will assume that the resistors we are using for the
    projects in this book are rated at that 1/4 Watt. Now let's say in our project
    we are running a voltage of 10V across a 100 Ohm resistor, do you think the resistor
    will be able to handle it? To figure this out, the first thing we need to do is
    to calculate the current using Ohm's law. We will use the formula *I *= *V*/*R*
    to calculate the current (*I *= 10V/100 Ohms) and come up with a current of 0.1
    Amps. We can now use the formula *P *= *V***I* to calculate the power (*P*=0.1A
    * 10V) which would equal 1 Watt, which is four times what the resistor is rated
    for, therefore the resistor will get very hot and may even get damaged.
