			<p>In a tech-driven world where embedded systems power nearly every modern device and innovation, the ability to develop efficient and reliable firmware is a prized skill. The journey from writing basic code to mastering low-level firmware development can be daunting, but the rewards are substantial. Whether it’s a home appliance, an industrial control system, or a sophisticated IoT device, embedded systems serve as the silent, hardworking engines behind <span class="No-Break">modern technology.</span></p>
			<p>This book, <em class="italic">Bare-Metal Embedded C Programming</em>, was born out of a desire to help you not only write functional firmware but also to deeply understand the underlying mechanisms that govern how microcontrollers work at their core. My goal is to take you on an in-depth, technical journey into the heart of ARM-based microcontroller firmware development, specifically focusing on the STM32 family. This is not a book for the faint of heart, nor is it one for those looking for quick shortcuts. Instead, it is designed for individuals who are ready to step away from the comforts of pre-built libraries and tools to develop the skills necessary for writing efficient, bare-metal code <span class="No-Break">from scratch.</span></p>
			<p>So, what exactly is <em class="italic">bare-metal</em> programming? Simply put, it’s the art of writing firmware that interacts directly with the hardware—without the abstraction layers provided by third-party libraries. This approach requires precision, a deep understanding of microcontroller architecture, and the ability to read and manipulate registers to achieve the exact behavior you want from <span class="No-Break">your hardware.</span></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Why I Wrote </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">This Book</em></span></p>
			<p>As someone with years of experience in embedded systems development, I’ve often noticed a gap in the way firmware development is taught. Many texts and courses focus on high-level development, promoting the use of pre-built libraries that abstract away the complexities of hardware interaction. While this approach is undoubtedly convenient and practical in many cases, it leaves a void for those who truly wish to understand how things work at the lowest level. I believe that understanding the “bare-metal” aspect of embedded systems development is essential for becoming a truly skilled <span class="No-Break">firmware engineer.</span></p>
			<p>This book is my effort to fill that gap. Through step-by-step guidance, I’ll show you how to build your own drivers, manipulate registers, and write code that takes full control of the microcontroller. This is not just about learning a new skill—it’s about <span class="No-Break">achieving mastery.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>If you’re a developer, engineer, or a student eager to dive deep into the world of microcontroller firmware development, this book is for you. You’ll find it especially valuable if you’re the kind of person who prefers to understand what’s happening under the hood, rather than relying on copy-paste solutions from online forums. Whether you’re transitioning from other platforms or seeking to build a strong foundation in bare-metal development, this book will give you the hands-on experience <span class="No-Break">you need.</span></p>
