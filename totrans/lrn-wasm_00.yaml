- en: This book introduces readers to WebAssembly, a new and exciting technology capable
    of executing languages other than JavaScript in the browser. The book describes
    how to build a C/JavaScript application from scratch that uses WebAssembly and
    the process for porting an existing C++ code base to run in the browser with the
    help of Emscripten.

- en: WebAssembly represents an important shift for the web platform. As a compilation
    target for languages such as C, C++, and Rust, it provides the ability to build
    a new class of application. WebAssembly is supported by all of the major browser
    vendors and represents a collaborative effort.

- en: In this book, we'll describe the elements that make up WebAssembly, as well
    as its origins. We'll walk through the process of installing the required tools,
    setting up a development environment, and interacting with WebAssembly. We'll
    work through simple examples and progress through increasingly advanced use cases.
    By the end of this book, you'll be well-equipped to use WebAssembly in your C,
    C++, or JavaScript project.

- en: If you are a C/C++ programmer who wishes to build applications for the web,
    or a web developer who wishes to improve the performance of their JavaScript applications,
    then this book is for you. The book is intended for developers familiar with JavaScript
    who wouldn't mind learning some C and C++ (and vice versa). This book accommodates
    for C/C++ programmers and JavaScript programmers alike by providing two example
    applications.

- en: You should have some programming experience and understand concepts such as
    variables, and functions. If you've never seen a line of JavaScript or C/C++ code,
    you may want to do some preliminary research before working through the examples
    in this book. I've chosen to use JavaScript ES6/7 features such as destructuring
    and arrow functions, so if you haven't worked with JavaScript in the last 3 -
    4 years, the syntax may look slightly different.
