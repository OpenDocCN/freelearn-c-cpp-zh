    chapter. We will first learn about the fundamental C++ topic of **pointers**.
    Pointers are variables that hold a memory address. Typically, a pointer will hold
    the memory address of another variable. This sounds a bit like a reference, but
    we will see how they are much more powerful and use a pointer to handle an ever-expanding
    horde of zombies.

    data management techniques.

    to manage all the textures from the game because, if we have 1,000 zombies, we
    don't really want to load a copy of a zombie graphic into the GPU for each and
    every one.

    is a function of a class that can be called without an instance of the class.
    At the same time, we will see how we can design a class to ensure that only one
    instance can ever exist. This is ideal when we need to guarantee that different
    parts of our code will use the same data.

    making a copy of what could be a large graphic. Also, notice that the function
    is declared as `static`. This means that the function can be used without an instance
    of the class. The function takes a `string` as a constant reference, as a parameter.

    `m_s_Instance` equals `nullptr`. If it doesn't the game will exit execution. Then,
    `m_s_Instance = this` assigns the pointer to `this` instance. Now, consider where
    this code is taking place. The code is in the constructor. The constructor is
    the way that we create instances of objects from classes. So, effectively, we
    now have a pointer to a `TextureHolder` that points to the one and only instance
    of itself.

    memory on the free store.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Q) Can you remind me about the `new` keyword and memory leaks?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A) When we use memory on the free store using the `new` keyword, it persists
    even when the function it was created in has returned and all the local variables
    are gone. When we are done with using memory on the free store, we must release
    it. So, if we use memory on the free store that we want to persist beyond the
    life of a function, we must make sure to keep a pointer to it or we will have
    leaked memory. It would be like putting all our belongings in our house and then
    forgetting where we live! When we return the `zombies` array from `createHorde`,
    it is like passing the relay baton (memory address) from `createHorde` to `main`.
    It's like saying, *OK, here is your horde of zombiesâ€” they are your responsibility
    now*. And, we wouldn't want any leaked zombies running around in our RAM! So,
    we must remember to call `delete` on pointers to dynamically allocated memory.
