<p>Programs regularly have to allocate and manage memory, no matter what programming language they are written in. Why and how we do this depends on the language and the application domain, however: real-time systems, embedded systems, games, and conventional desktop applications all have different needs and constraints, and there is no single, universal best approach to all problems.</p>
<p>This book shows how modern C++ lets programmers write simpler and safer programs, but also how that language makes it possible to take control of memory allocation mechanisms and make sure programs respect the constraints they face. Starting from the language’s basic concepts of objects’ lifetimes and memory organization, you will learn how to write your own containers and your own allocators, and to adapt the very behavior of allocation operators to suit your needs. Depending on your needs, you will be able to make programs that are smaller, faster, more predictable... and safer.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is written for individuals who have some programming experience and who enjoy both high-level and low-level programming. Having prior experience with generic programming and concurrent programming will lead to a more pleasant reading experience.</p>
<p>More specifically, this book is written for you if (a) you think managing memory in C++ is difficult but are willing to take a fresh look at it, (b) you want better control over the way your programs manage memory, or (c) you want your programs to be smaller, faster, and safer. You might benefit from this book if you come from a C++ background, of course, but also if you normally program in other languages and would like to look at what C++ allows you to do. This book will be helpful to any programmer, but you might find it particularly useful if you program in constrained environments (such as embedded systems or game consoles) or in other application domains where you need tight control over resource allocation mechanisms. Who knows, you might even enjoy it!</p>

<p><a href="B21071_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor047"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Casts and cv-qualifications</em>, examines the tools at our disposal to coerce the type system to our needs and discusses how to use these sometimes sharp tools in reasonable ways.</p>
<p><a href="B21071_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor062"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Using Destructors</em>, looks at this important aspect of C++ that makes it possible to write objects that are responsible for the management of resources in general and of memory in particular.</p>
<p><a href="B21071_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor079"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Using Standard Smart Pointers</em>, provides a look at how we can benefit from this important part of contemporary C++ programming, which inscribes responsibility over memory into the type system.</p>
<p><a href="B21071_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor096"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Writing Smart Pointers</em>, looks at ways in which we write homemade versions of the standard smart pointers as well as how we can design our own smart pointers to cover niches that are not yet covered by those provided by the standard library.</p>
<p><a href="B21071_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor116"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Overloading Memory Allocation Operators</em>, shows some of the many ways in which we can provide our own versions of memory allocation operators and explains why it can be a good idea to do so.</p>
<p><a href="B21071_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor128"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Writing a Naïve Leak Detector</em>, puts our new memory management skills to use to write a working (if simple) tool to detect memory leaks in a way that is essentially transparent to user code.</p>
<p><a href="B21071_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor141"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Atypical Allocation Mechanisms</em>, takes a tour of some unusual applications (and overloads) of the standard memory allocation operators, including non-throwing versions and others that handle “exotic” memory.</p>
<p><a href="B21071_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor153"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Arena-Based Memory Management and Other Optimizations</em>, uses our memory management skills to make programs execute more quickly and behave more deterministically, benefitting from domain-specific or application-specific knowledge.</p>
<p><a href="B21071_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor163"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deferred Reclamation</em>, explores ways in which we can write programs that automatically reclaim dynamically allocated objects at chosen moments during program execution.</p>
<p><a href="B21071_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor172"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Writing Generic Containers with Explicit Memory Management</em>, explains how to write two efficient generic containers that manage memory themselves and discusses exception-safety and complexity tradeoffs of this practice.</p>
<p><a href="B21071_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor187"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a>, <em class="italic">Writing Generic Containers with Implicit Memory Management</em>, revisits the containers written in the previous chapter to see the impacts of moving from an explicit memory management approach to an implicit one that relies on smart pointers.</p>
<p><a href="B21071_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor199"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>, <em class="italic">Writing Generic Containers with Allocator Support</em>, revisits our homemade containers to see how memory management can be customized through allocators, covering allocators from before C++11 to contemporary allocators, as well as PMR allocators.</p>
<p><a href="B21071_15.xhtml#_idTextAnchor213"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></a>, <em class="italic">Contemporary Issues</em>, looks toward the near future and examines some recent (as of the book’s writing) features of C++ that pertain to memory management as well as some interesting candidate additions to the language in C++26 and C++29.</p>

<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-15" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"/>Part 1: Memory in C++</h1>
<p>In this part, we will develop a common vocabulary on some key aspects of the object model in C++. This includes a discussion of ideas such as what an object is, what a reference is, and how C++ represents memory; a look at some of the risky or delicate maneuvers we sometimes need to do when writing low-level code (and the consequences that stem from doing them inappropriately); and how to coerce the type system to our needs in ways that do not come back to harm us. The knowledge gathered in this part will serve as a basis from which later chapters will be built.</p>
<p>This part has the following chapters:</p>
