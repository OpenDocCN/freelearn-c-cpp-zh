<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Preface</h1>
<p>Immerse yourself in Unreal game projects with this book, written by four highly experienced industry professionals with many years of combined experience with Unreal Engine. <em class="italic">Elevating Game Experiences with Unreal Engine 5</em> will walk you through the latest version of Unreal Engine by helping you get hands-on with the game creation projects.The book starts with an introduction to the Unreal Editor and key concepts such as actors, blueprints, animations, inheritance, and player input. You’ll then move on to the first of three projects – building a dodgeball game, where you’ll learn the concepts of line traces, collisions, projectiles, user interface, and sound effects. You’ll also discover how to combine these concepts to showcase your new skills. The second project, a side-scroller game, will help you implement concepts such as animation blending, enemy AI, spawning objects, and collectibles. And finally, you’ll cover the key concepts in creating a multiplayer environment as you work on the third project – an FPS game. By the end of the Unreal Engine book, you’ll have a broad understanding of how to use the tools that the game engine provides to start building your own games.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is for game developers looking to get started with using Unreal Engine 5 for their game development projects. Anyone who has used Unreal Engine before and wants to consolidate, improve, and apply their skills will find this book useful. To better grasp the concepts explained in this book, prior knowledge of C++ basics (such as variables, functions, classes, polymorphism, and pointers) is required. For full compatibility with the IDE used in this book, a Windows system is recommended.</p>

<p>To access the files of the Unreal Engine GitHub repository linked throughout this book, make sure to follow these instructions:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue-on-github">https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue-on-github</a></p>
<p>If you get an error 404 on a link from this book to the Unreal Engine documentation, it means that it hasn't been updated yet to 5.0. You should pick the previous engine version from the dropdown on the top left corner of the page.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>Installing Visual Studio </h2>
<p>Because we’ll be using C++ while working with Unreal Engine 5, we’ll need an <strong class="bold">Integrated Development Environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>) that easily works alongside the engine. Visual Studio Community is the best IDE you have available for this purpose on Windows. If you’re using macOS or Linux, you’ll have to use another IDE, such as Visual Studio Code, Qt Creator, or Xcode (available exclusively on macOS). </p>
<p>The instructions given in this book are specific to Visual Studio Community on Windows, so if you are using a different OS and/or IDE, then you will need to do your research on how to set these up for use in your working environment. In this section, you’ll be taken through the installation of Visual Studio, so that you can easily edit UE5’s C++ files: </p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Visual Studio download web page at <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads">https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads</a>. The recommended Visual Studio Community version for the Unreal Engine 5 version we’ll be using in this book (5.0.3) is Visual Studio Community 2022. Be sure to download that version. </li>
<li>When you do, open the executable file that you just downloaded. It should eventually take you to a window where you’ll be able to pick the modules of your Visual Studio installation. There, you’ll have to tick the <strong class="bold">Game Development with C++</strong> module and then click the <strong class="bold">Install</strong> button in the bottom-right corner of the window. After you click that button, Visual Studio will start downloading and installing. When the installation is complete, it may ask you to reboot your PC. After rebooting your PC, Visual Studio should be installed and ready for use. </li>
<li>When you run Visual Studio for the first time, you may see a few windows, the first one of which is the login window. If you have a Microsoft Outlook/Hotmail account, you should use that account to log in, otherwise, you can skip login by clicking <strong class="bold">Not now, maybe later</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<p class="callout-heading">Note </p>
<p class="callout">If you don’t input an email address, you will only have 30 days to use Visual Studio before it locks out and you have to input an email address to continue using it. </p>
<ol>
<li value="4">After that, you will be asked to choose a color scheme. The <strong class="bold">Dark</strong> theme is the most popular and the one we will be using in this section. </li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, you can select the <strong class="bold">Start Visual Studio</strong> option. When you do so, however, you can close it again. We will be taking a deeper look at how to use Visual Studio in <a href="B18531_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor043"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a><em class="italic">, Working with Unreal Engine</em> of this book. </p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-11"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>Epic Games Launcher </h2>
<p>To access Unreal Engine 5, you’ll need to download the Epic Games Launcher, available at this link: <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/download">https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/download</a>. </p>
<p>Before you do so, be sure to check its hardware requirements at this link: <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/hardware-and-software-specifications-for-unreal-engine/">https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/hardware-and-software-specifications-for-unreal-engine/</a>.</p>
<p>This link will allow you to download the Epic Games Launcher for Windows and macOS. If you use Linux, you’ll have to download the Unreal Engine source code and compile it from the source – <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/downloading-unreal-engine-source-code/">https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/downloading-unreal-engine-source-code/</a>: </p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Click the <strong class="bold">Download Launcher</strong> option. A <strong class="source-inline">.msi</strong> file will be downloaded to your computer. Open this <strong class="source-inline">.msi</strong> file when it finishes downloading, which will prompt you to install the Epic Games Launcher. Follow the installation instructions and then launch the Epic Games Launcher. When you do so, you should be greeted with a login screen. </li>
<li>If you already have an account, you can simply log in with your existing credentials. If you don’t, you’ll have to sign up for an Epic Games account by clicking the <strong class="bold">Sign Up</strong> text at the bottom. </li>
</ol>
<p>Once you log in with your account, you should be greeted by the <strong class="bold">Home</strong> tab. From there, you’ll want to go to the <strong class="bold">Unreal Engine</strong> tab by clicking the text that says <strong class="bold">Unreal Engine</strong>. </p>
<ol>
<li value="3">When you’ve done that, you’ll be greeted with the <strong class="bold">Store</strong> tab. The Epic Games Launcher is not only the place from which you install and launch Unreal Engine 5, but it’s also a game store. Press the <strong class="bold">Unreal Engine</strong> tab on the left side of the launcher.</li>
<li>You will now find several sub-tabs at the top of the Epic Games Launcher, the first of which is the <strong class="bold">News</strong> sub-tab. This acts as a hub for Unreal Engine resources. From this page, you’ll be able to access the following: <ul><li>The <strong class="bold">News</strong> page, on which you’ll be able to take a look at all the latest Unreal Engine news</li><li>The <strong class="bold">YouTube</strong> channel, on which you’ll be able to watch dozens of tutorials and live streams that go into detail about several different Unreal Engine topics </li><li>The <strong class="bold">Q&amp;A</strong> page, on which you’ll be able to see, ask, and answer questions posed and answered by the Unreal Engine community</li><li>The <strong class="bold">Forums</strong> page, on which you’ll be able to access the Unreal Engine forums</li><li>The <strong class="bold">Roadmap</strong> page, on which you’ll be able to access the Unreal Engine roadmap, including features delivered in past versions of the engine, as well as features that are currently in development for future versions </li></ul></li>
<li>The <strong class="bold">Samples</strong> tab will allow you to access several project samples that you can use to learn how to use Unreal Engine 5. </li>
<li>To the right of the <strong class="bold">Samples</strong> tab is the <strong class="bold">Marketplace</strong> tab. This tab shows you several assets and code plugins made by members of the Unreal Engine community. Here, you’ll be able to find 3D assets, music, levels, and code plugins that will help you advance and accelerate the development of your game. </li>
<li>To the right of the <strong class="bold">Marketplace</strong> tab, we have the <strong class="bold">Library</strong> tab. Here, you’ll be able to browse and manage all your Unreal Engine version installations, your Unreal Engine projects, and your <strong class="bold">Marketplace</strong> asset vault. Because we have none of these things yet, these sections are all empty. Let’s change that. </li>
<li>Click the yellow plus sign to the right of the <strong class="bold">ENGINE VERSIONS</strong> text. This should make a new icon show up, where you’ll be able to choose your desired Unreal Engine version. </li>
<li>Throughout this book, we’ll be using version <em class="italic">5.0</em> of Unreal Engine. After you’ve selected that version, click the <strong class="bold">Install</strong> button: </li>
