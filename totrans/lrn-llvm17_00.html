			<p>Constructing a compiler is a complex and fascinating task. The LLVM project provides reusable components for your compiler and the LLVM core libraries implement a world-class optimizing code generator, which translates a source language-independent intermediate representation of machine code for all popular CPU architectures. The compilers for many programming languages already take advantage of <span class="No-Break">LLVM technology.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>This book teaches you how to implement your own compiler and how to use LLVM to achieve it. You will learn how the frontend of a compiler turns source code into an abstract syntax tree, and how to generate <strong class="bold">Intermediate Representation</strong> (<strong class="bold">IR</strong>) from it. Furthermore, you will also explore adding an optimization pipeline to your compiler, which allows you to compile the IR to performant <span class="No-Break">machine code.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The LLVM framework can be extended in several ways, and you will learn how to add new passes, and even a completely new backend to LLVM. Advanced topics such as compiling for a different CPU architecture and extending clang and the clang static analyzer with your own plugins and checkers are also covered. This book follows a practical approach and is packed with example source code, which makes it easy to apply the gained knowledge within your <span class="No-Break">own projects.</span></p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>What’s new in this edition</h1>&#13;
			<p><em class="italic">Learn LLVM 17</em> now features a new chapter dedicated to introducing the concept and syntax of the TableGen language used within LLVM, in which readers can leverage to define classes, records, and an entire LLVM backend. Furthermore, this book also presents an emphasis on backend development, which discusses various new backend concepts that can be implemented for an LLVM backend, such as implementing the GlobalISel instruction framework and developing machine <span class="No-Break">function passes.</span></p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>Who this book is for</h1>&#13;
			<p>This book is for compiler developers, enthusiasts, and engineers who are interested in learning about the LLVM framework. It is also useful for C++ software engineers looking to use compiler-based tools for code analysis and improvement, as well as casual users of LLVM libraries who want to gain more knowledge of LLVM essentials. Intermediate-level experience with C++ programming is mandatory to understand the concepts covered in this book <span class="No-Break">more effectively.</span></p>&#13;

At the end of the chapter, you will have implemented your first compiler producing <span class="No-Break">LLVM IR.</span></p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B19561_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor055"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Turning the Source File into an Abstract Syntax Tree</em>, teaches you in detail how to implement the frontend of a compiler. You will create your own frontend for a small programming language, ending with the construction of an abstract <span class="No-Break">syntax tree.</span></p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B19561_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor068"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Basics of IR Code Generation</em>, shows you how to generate LLVM IR from an abstract syntax tree. At the end of the chapter, you will have implemented a compiler for the example language, emitting assembly text or object code files as <span class="No-Break">a result.</span></p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B19561_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor091"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">IR Generation for High-Level Language Constructs</em>, illustrates how you translate source language features commonly found in high-level programming languages to LLVM IR. You will learn about the translation of aggregate data types, the various options to implement class inheritance and virtual functions, and how to comply with the application binary interface of <span class="No-Break">your system.</span></p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B19561_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor101"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Advanced IR Generation</em>, shows you how to generate LLVM IR for exception-handling statements in the source language. You will also learn how to add metadata for type-based alias analysis, and how to add debug information to the generated LLVM IR, and you will extend your <span class="No-Break">compiler-generated metadata.</span></p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B19561_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor117"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Optimizing IR</em>, explains the LLVM pass manager. You will implement your own pass, both as part of LLVM and as a plugin, and you will learn how to add your new pass to the optimizing <span class="No-Break">pass pipeline.</span></p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B19561_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor132"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">The TableGen Language</em>, introduces LLVM’s own domain-specific language called TableGen. This language is used to reduce the coding effort of the developer, and you will learn about the different ways you can define data in the TableGen language, and how it can be leveraged in <span class="No-Break">the backend.</span></p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B19561_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor145"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">JIT Compilation</em>, discusses how you can use LLVM to implement a <strong class="bold">just-in-time</strong> (<strong class="bold">JIT</strong>) compiler. By the end of the chapter, you will have implemented your own JIT compiler for LLVM IR in two <span class="No-Break">different ways.</span></p>&#13;
