    <h1 id="_idParaDest-110" class="partTitle">Transforming the Model Viewer into an Animation Editor</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this part, you will build the foundation for the game character animation by enhancing the model viewer into an animation editor. You will learn how to add a separate viewing mode, allowing you to disable parts of the code that may not need or want to be active at some time, such as the user interface when recording videos. You will be also introduced to the general idea of the ability to revert changes made to model instances, ending up in a basic implementation of an undo/redo functionality. You will also learn how to store the currently loaded models and instances plus various settings to a YAML file, and how to load the data back into the application, allowing you to continue editing the models at any time, or to create multiple configurations. Finally, you will explore different camera types for the virtual world, giving you the chance to view the character animations from all angles and perspectives you may think of.</p>
