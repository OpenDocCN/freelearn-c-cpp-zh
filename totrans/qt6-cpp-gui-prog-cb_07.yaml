    a client program using Qt 6’s networking module. We will also learn how to create
    a program that uses **File Transfer Protocol** (**FTP**) to upload and download
    files from the server. Lastly, we will learn how to send HTTP requests to a specific
    web service using Qt 6 and C++ language.

- en: There are mainly two types of network connections—the TCP connection and the
    **User Datagram Protocol** (**UDP**) connection. TCP is a reliable networking
    connection, while UDP is unreliable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'These two connections are designed for very different purposes:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: TCP networking is usually for programs that require every single piece of data
    to be sent and received in order. It also makes sure that the client receives
    the data and that the server gets notified of that. Programs such as messaging
    software, web servers, and databases use TCP networking.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: UDP networking, on the other hand, does not require constant handholding between
    the server and client. Since the connection is unreliable, there is also no feedback
    on whether the data has been successfully received. The dropping of packets is
    tolerated, and data may not even come in the same order as it was sent. UDP connections
    are usually used by applications that stream huge amounts of data to their clients
    without strict requirements on its packet delivery, such as video games, video
    conferencing software, and domain name systems.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Creating networking software using Qt 6 is a lot easier through its signals
    and slots mechanism. All we need to do is connect the signals emitted by the `QTcpServer`
    class and `QTcpSocket` class to our slot functions. We will then implement these
    slot functions and define what to do within those functions.

- en: Do note that this example program is only meant to show you the most basic implementation
    of an FTP program and is not a fully featured program. It’s not guaranteed to
    work if you try to upload/download files that are not in text format. It may also
    not upload correctly if a file already exists on the FTP server. You must implement
    these features by yourself if you wish to expand on top of this project.

- en: Although this project is much larger and with longer code, it is actually pretty
    similar to the TCP networking projects we have done in previous recipes. We have
    also made use of the signals and slots mechanism provided by Qt 6 to make our
    lives easier.

    FTP has since been deprecated in Qt 6 so we have to implement it on our own.

    our program. For more information, check out [https://www.serv-u.com/resources/tutorial/appe-stor-stou-retr-list-mlsd-mlst-ftp-command](https://www.serv-u.com/resources/tutorial/appe-stor-stou-retr-list-mlsd-mlst-ftp-command).
