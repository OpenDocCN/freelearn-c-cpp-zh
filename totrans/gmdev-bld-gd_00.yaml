- en: '*Game Development with Godot and Blender is a comprehensive introduction for
    those who are new to building 3D models and games, allowing you to leverage the
    abilities of these two technologies to create dynamic, interactive, and engaging
    games.*'

- en: '*This book will start by focusing on what low-poly modeling actually is, before
    diving into using Blender to create, rig, and animate our models. We will also
    make sure that these assets are game-ready, making it easy for you to import them
    into Godot and use your assets effectively and efficiently. Then, in Godot, you
    will use the game engine to design scenes, work with light and shadows, and transform
    your 3D models into interactive, controllable assets.*'

- en: '*By the end of the book, you will have a seamless workflow between Blender
    and Godot that is specifically geared towards game development and will have created
    a point-and-click adventure game following our instructions and guidance. Beyond
    this point, you should be able to take these newly acquired skills and create
    your own 3D games from conception to completion!*'

    2D to 3D games. You should have a basic understanding of Godot, and be able to
    navigate the UI, understand the Inspector panel, create scenes, add scripts to
    game objects, and so on. Previous experience with Blender is helpful but not required.*'

    presents different light types and how to capture a shot of your scene. You’ll
    be revisiting some of these notions in the Godot context later in [*Chapter 10*](B17473_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor165),
    *Making Things Look Better with Lights and Shadows*.'

    Rigging*, discusses the notion of animation and whether doing it in Godot or Blender
    is the right choice. Once we settle the matter in Blender’s favor, you’ll rig
    and animate a simple model.'

    through Camera and Character Controllers*, presents different camera types and
    settings on different gaming platforms. After attaining a basic view into the
    game world, you’ll continue with detecting user input, which is essential for
    the type of game you are building. To finish off, you’ll use this information
    to move a game character to their designated spot.'

    Animation*, finishes the core mechanics of our little game. To that end, you’ll
    be adding sound effects and animations to certain game objects. Also, you’ll create
    a simple animation in Godot and create the necessary conditions for the player
    to meet in order to trigger this animation. Once all the in-game requirements
    are finished, you’ll load a new level for the player.'
