<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">There is not a single official definition</span><a id="_idIndexMarker004"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1"> of the IoT, but the following sentence covers the concept in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">its entirety:</span></span></p>
<p><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">The Internet of Things or, briefly, IoT is the concept of connecting physical objects to a network and other devices to let them interact with each other and with human beings to share information and take action through </span></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">the Internet.</span></em></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">These physical objects are electronic devices using different telecommunication technologies to connect to a network. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">It’s not surprising that the choice of network falls to the internet, not only because of the name of this technology but the characteristics of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">internet itself:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">A </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">digital network</span></span></li>

</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">IoT devices are often called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">IoT Nodes</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1"> because they are part</span><a id="_idIndexMarker005"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1"> of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">this network.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">They feature sensors to detect or measure a physical property, such as the temperature of the environment or the speed of a vehicle. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">In other</span><a id="_idIndexMarker006"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1"> cases, they are connected to external machinery, devices, or appliances, always with the same purpose: collecting the values of physical properties, often called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">Telemetry Elements</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">, and transmitting them to the internet. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">Once the values have reached the internet, they can arrive almost everywhere in the world in a few hundredths of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">a second.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">You may think about interfacing an IoT node to an industrial machine to remotely transmit the information about its running conditions, and eventually alert a maintenance operator, in case of a fault. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">Or, connecting the node to your coffee machine to measure the level of the coffee grounds with the possibility to check it remotely while you are at the supermarket so that you can buy another pack only </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">if required.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">As a matter of fact, the IoT opens up the possibility to virtually infinite applications because connecting a device to the internet implies the possibility to both monitor the environment and send commands to the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">node remotely.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">In fact, the telecommunication</span><a id="_idIndexMarker007"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1"> technologies used in the IoT are bidirectional and information can flow from the IoT node to the internet and vice versa. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">The interaction among IoT nodes is mainly related to the exchange of digital information by using the internet as the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">communication media.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">Intelligence at the edge versus on the cloud</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">It’s important to underline</span><a id="_idIndexMarker008"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1"> that IoT nodes also have processing</span><a id="_idIndexMarker009"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1"> capabilities to different extents; they can be programmed to receive information from the internet and implement some </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">logic accordingly.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">Another example might help. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">You can interface IoT </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">Node #1</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1"> to a weather station, collect information about the forecast, and transmit it to IoT </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">Node #2</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1"> connected to your automatic irrigation unit. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">You may program </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">Node #2</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1"> to prevent a waste of water in case rain is expected in the next few hours. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">Another node, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">Node #3</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">, can embed a sensor and share the soil moisture value with </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">Node #2</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1"> through the internet so that irrigation is activated, if necessary, when the forecast is good and the soil </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">requires water.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">This may not be relevant to my small garden, but you might consider the benefits in the case of extensive fields, where different areas may be irrigated depending on the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">crop’s requirements.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">When the control logic is programmed directly on a node, we say that it is </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">at the edge</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">, referring to the edge between the physical and the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">digital world.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">The logic can also be programmed </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">on the cloud</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.2">In this case, there is an application running on a computer connected to the internet. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.3">In fact, the cloud empowers a huge number of computers connected together and to the internet with the aim of sharing computational and storage power, as well as balancing the computational load across multiple systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.4">With the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">on-the-cloud</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1"> approach, the application on the cloud receives telemetry elements from one or more IoT nodes, aggregates the information, and defines the commands to send back to the same or other </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">IoT nodes.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">I talk about commands because IoT nodes can also be interfaced with actuators, such as motors, pumps, electro valves, electrical relays, and any other device responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.2">This means that an IoT node can interact with the physical world by performing physical, programmed actions as a reaction to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">certain measures.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">Considering the example of irrigation, the IoT node is electrically connected to a hydraulic servo valve and drives it to control the flow of water to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">the nozzles.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">IoT nodes always implement embedded control logic to some extent, even when the intelligence of the application resides </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">on the cloud</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">This is required to receive, interpret, and react to the commands from the application server on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">the cloud.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">The distinction between </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">on the edge</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1"> and </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">on the cloud</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1"> is mainly related to the real intelligence of the application, such as the capability to understand when it’s necessary to irrigate on the basis of the forecast and the moisture of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">the soil.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">So, intelligence </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">on the edge</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1"> is completely programmed on the node by writing software code in a structured language</span><a id="_idIndexMarker010"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1"> such as C++ or MicroPython, or adopting artificial intelligence models</span><a id="_idIndexMarker011"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1"> based on neural networks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.2">With the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">on-the-cloud</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1"> approach, it is the responsibility of application software running on a cloud server to decide to automatically trigger </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">a valve.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">The choice between on-the-edge and on-the-cloud implementations is mainly driven by the application and the required response time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.2">Implementations on the cloud allow more freedom in terms of programmable features. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.3">This is because the cloud is composed of multiple servers working together and it has virtually no constraints of memory and computational power. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.4">On the other hand, deployments on the edge remove some bottlenecks related to the latency of communication networks, reducing the response time of an IoT node and allowing it to interact with the physical world in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">real time.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">It’s worth noting that an implementation on the edge doesn’t preclude the benefit of implementing manual remote control of the nodes in addition to automatic control. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.2">For example, an operator could interact</span><a id="_idIndexMarker012"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1"> with the devices in the field through a graphical user interface visualized on a web page (called a </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">dashboard</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.2">They would see the actual values of environmental conditions and could trigger the valve as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">they liked.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">The programmer of the application is responsible for defining and configuring the dashboards, which can be as complex as required, with widgets to visualize and insert data such as graphs and textboxes, and trigger commands such as switches, sliders, pushbuttons, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">many others.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">The market sees an increasing number of on-the-edge applications for various use cases where microcontroller devices can be successfully adopted as control units of IoT nodes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.2">This trend has led to the continuous, fast improvements in hardware components, with augmented computational capabilities and a consequent decrease in their cost, as well as the mass availability of wireless telecommunication technologies characterized by very low power consumption and long-distance </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">transmission range.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">When we consider the installation of IoT nodes in remote and not easily accessible areas, energy autonomy is a very important aspect: we want to reduce the need for battery recharging as much as possible to decrease the costs of human intervention. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.2">Ideally, a good IoT application is supposed to be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">fully autonomous!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">When you adopt one of the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">Low-Power Wide Area Network</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">LPWAN</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">) technologies, you need to consider</span><a id="_idIndexMarker013"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1"> that a decreased power consumption comes at the expense of a reduced quantity of data that can be transmitted with a single message and a higher interval between messages. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.2">It’s like considering data as a form of energy and applying the energy conservation law: if you decrease the power, you decrease the amount of data, not only the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">transmission range.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">A decreased amount of data per message and a longer interval between two transmissions mean that you need to reduce</span><a id="_idIndexMarker014"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1"> the information exchanged with the cloud so that the cloud needs</span><a id="_idIndexMarker015"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1"> less time to collect all the values </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">to process.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">When this duration, which we may call </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">Cloud Latency Time</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">, is too long, then it’s worth implementing</span><a id="_idIndexMarker016"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1"> intelligence on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">the edge.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">It’s not surprising that the Arduino Cloud also follows the same approach, and you’ll see how easy it is to develop an IoT cloud application with the Arduino Cloud, without programming but configuring it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.2">The ease of use of the Arduino Cloud is related to the native on-the-edge model: Arduino follows the technology trend of implementing the intelligence on the nodes, leaving the data storage and visualization tasks to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">the cloud.</span></span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.1">Benefits for users</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.1">Applications based</span><a id="_idIndexMarker047"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.1"> on these smart technologies offer huge benefits to end users such as automating tasks and making Things remotely controllable </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.1">and monitorable.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.1">The IoT and IIoT improve our efficiency by letting IoT applications optimize the usage of resources and allowing us to reduce costs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.2">They also enhance our safety and security, because IoT devices can provide real-time monitoring </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.365.1">and alerts.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.1">Data collection and analysis by IoT nodes can be used to personalize our experiences and the augmented connectivity provided by IoT solutions creates new possibilities for communication </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.367.1">and collaboration.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.368.1">Finally, the IoT and IIoT enable new and modern business models, as we’ll see in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.1">next section.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.1">You may ask why all this is happening now and if it comes without </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.371.1">a cost.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.1">The history of the IoT can be traced back to the 1980s when the term was first used by British technology pioneer Kevin Ashton in a presentation about the potential for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.1">interconnected devices.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.1">In the early 2000s, the development of wireless networking standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi made it easier to connect devices to the internet and cellular connectivity became a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.1">consumer market.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.1">Ten years later, major technology companies, such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, began to invest in IoT </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.1">cloud platforms.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.1">Today, after 40 years, the progress of software technology has made big data, data analytics tools, and cloud platforms accessible and affordable for most people. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.2">The internet is a predominant medium of communication and the decreased cost of electronics, together with ecosystems such as Arduino, has made the technology easy </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.1">to use.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.1">The IoT indirectly brings costs to businesses of every size because they need to seize the moment, adopt these technologies, and keep up with progress to remain competitive in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.1">the market.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.382.1">The social impact of the IoT</span><a id="_idIndexMarker048"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.1"> is related to the introduction of different behaviors and the risk of human beings losing some manual and practical capabilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.2">For example, people who used to travel by car before navigation applications were available on mobile phones had a certain sense of orientation; nowadays, this skill has </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.1">almost disappeared.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.1">The IIoT introduces the risk of misleading managers to think that these technologies support cost savings by reducing the workforce because everything is automated. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.2">Actually, the personnel need training to maintain, troubleshoot, and improve the new systems, and it’s important that business managers </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.1">understand this.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.1">In the end, it is the responsibility</span><a id="_idIndexMarker049"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.1"> of everyone involved in an IoT project to consider the application and manage the social effects properly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.2">It means that it’s also your responsibility, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.1">dear reader.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.1">We are now fully in the Web 3.0 phase where the IoT requires a drastic shift of mindset in the creation and the capture of commercial value. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.2">The Business School of Harvard University spotted this change and highlighted a series </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.1">of implications.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.408.1">First of all, customers require their needs to be addressed in real time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.408.2">The IoT even allows businesses to address emergent needs in a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.409.1">predictive manner.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.1">The possibilities offered</span><a id="_idIndexMarker053"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.1"> by the IoT change the product management processes</span><a id="_idIndexMarker054"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.1"> during their life cycle. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.2">The obsolescence reduces and it happens over a longer time because new versions of a product are evaluated by considering aggregated information about usage, collected automatically from products themselves, and analyzed to identify the effective requirements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.3">Furthermore, the proposed user experience is based expressly on the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.1">collaboration</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.1"> of the products with others, eventually manufactured by </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.1">third parties.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.1">This moves the value of the products in such a way that customers perceive more benefits in the personalization of the products and their features than in commodity advantages such as lower cost, higher quality, and immediate availability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.2">Or, in the case of professional and industrial products, brand and ownership of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.1">intellectual property.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.1">The appreciation for the collaboration capabilities of IoT products also suggests manufacturers should invest resources in understanding how other ecosystems work and make money, with the aim of developing a certain level of compatibility, more so than making a big effort to leverage internal core competencies and existing resources </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.1">and processes.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.1">Once the features of the new version are identified and implemented, manufacturers can often update many products at the same time, and remotely over the air. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.2">This is one of the appealing services that can be offered as the intrinsic value of a product or a paid service </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.421.1">for subscribers.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.1">The increased possibility to offer additional services moves the path to profit in the business strategy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.2">The new approach is the search for the optimal balance between immediate and recurrent revenues. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.3">Immediate revenues, related to the traditional core business, often require a lot of effort and large investments to scale the number of sold products. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.4">On the other hand, the activities required to establish and maintain a good service offering, based on IoT capabilities, guarantee recurrent revenues </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.423.1">in time.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.424.1">Business models enabled by the IoT</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.1">When you buy a mobile phone</span><a id="_idIndexMarker055"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.1"> from one of the two or three main</span><a id="_idIndexMarker056"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.1"> manufacturers, typically, you don’t pay the real value of the device itself, but the perceived value of the product. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.2">Many people are keen on spending more on a mobile that represents a status symbol, rather than on an anonymous model, even with the same features. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.3">The status symbol is a benefit perceived as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.1">product value.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.1">In a similar way, we may calculate the price of an IoT solution on the benefits it provides, instead of its costs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.2">For example, we may consider a smart building project for energy efficiency: the IoT system tracks and analyzes energy usage, automatically controls illumination in common areas, and allows the owner of a building to identify areas for improvement and reduce their </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.430.1">energy costs.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.431.1">According to this model, called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.432.1">outcome-based</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.1">, a solution provider may propose the system for a percentage</span><a id="_idIndexMarker057"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.1"> of the savings on the energy bills of the customer, plus the installation and removal costs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.2">They maintain the property using their IoT hardware without selling it but, when they close the contract, they have created a source of recurrent revenue for a certain amount of time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.3">At the end of the contract period, they remove and reuse the IoT products for another installation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.4">In this way, the cost of the IoT hardware is an investment of the solution provider and, considering the product life cycle mentioned previously and the low level of wear of these devices, it can generate a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.435.1">good return.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.1">Paying for the benefits provided doesn’t implicitly mean paying more than the value of the product, but it can still</span><a id="_idIndexMarker058"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.1"> be convenient for both parties involved. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.2">This is the case with the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.438.1">pay-per-usage</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.1"> model. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.2">Going back to the smart irrigation example, farmers can then use the IoT application provided by the water company to water their crops, with charges based on the amount of water used. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.3">The goal is not to make money on the IoT device itself but to use the data produced by the nodes to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.440.1">track usage.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.1">The </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.442.1">asset-sharing</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.1"> model is a pay-per-usage model characterized</span><a id="_idIndexMarker059"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.1"> by the fact that the asset monitored by the IoT nodes is shared among multiple customers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.2">For example, in the last few years, many businesses have bought and rented electric scooters in many different cities in the world. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.3">The user enrolls on the provider’s platform and uses their mobile, connected to the internet, to start and stop the rental and enable the scooter accordingly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.4">This is a very good example of an IoT application in the smart cities vertical: both the user’s mobile and the scooter are connected to, and interact through, the internet. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.5">In this case, the user pays for the benefit of riding in certain areas less than they would pay to buy their own scooter because they share the IoT product, the scooter, with the local community. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.6">The asset-sharing model is based on the concept of selling extra capacity to the market and solves the big concern that everyone has when buying expensive equipment: will I be able to utilize it to its </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.1">maximum capacity?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.1">When we talk about</span><a id="_idIndexMarker060"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.1"> business models related to the sale of services, the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.448.1">subscription</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.449.1"> model is the most well known: the user doesn’t pay to own the solution, but they pay an amount regularly to use it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.449.2">This model is usually adopted by companies offering smart home devices such as connected thermostats, security cameras, and smart locks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.449.3">Customers pay a monthly or annual fee for access to the devices, as well as the ability to control and monitor them through a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.1">mobile app.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.451.1">One type of IoT subscription</span><a id="_idIndexMarker061"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.1"> business model with a growing trend in its adoption is </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.1">asset tracking</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.2">The reduction in power consumption and dimensions, as well as the decreased dimensions and costs of IoT nodes, enable a progressive adoption to localize different assets they are attached to. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.3">In this case, the subscriber doesn’t pay for the IoT nodes but for regular access to the localization data and the movements of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.1">the assets.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.456.1">The IoT supports the proposal</span><a id="_idIndexMarker062"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.1"> of other kinds of services; for example, a predictive</span><a id="_idIndexMarker063"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.1"> maintenance IoT solution enables the sales of a convenient maintenance service, where the contract is appealing to both the contractor and the customer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.2">The contractor can keep their tariffs lower because they don’t need to schedule periodical visits to their customer: the system will inform them in advance to plan the intervention before it becomes urgent. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.3">At the same time, they can enlarge their customer base to justify the cost of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.459.1">installed solutions.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.1">A consultancy company can install an IoT solution to measure the performance of machinery in a production plant without stopping any machine because all data is collected by autonomous IoT nodes</span><a id="_idIndexMarker064"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.461.1"> that don’t need interfaces to the existing plant. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.461.2">Data is used to measure the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.1">Overall Equipment Effectiveness</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.463.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.1">OEE</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.465.1">) and suggest how to optimize the usage of the plant. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.465.2">In this case, the core business of the company is not the sale of IoT solutions, but the services deriving from the data collected by the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.466.1">IoT application.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.467.1">The </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.468.1">razor-blade</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.1"> business model in the IoT is similar to traditional models but with the added convenience</span><a id="_idIndexMarker065"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.1"> and customization of IoT technology. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.2">The goal is to get the product in the customer’s hands, at cost or even less, to start selling your other products. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.3">The name comes from the company Gillette®, the inventor and first adopter: its main revenues come from the sale of the blades while razors are just the main source to bring about the sales of blades as one razor sold will generate multiple purchases of blades. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.4">In a similar way, HP® sells inkjet printers at a very low price with the aim of gaining revenues from the sale of the cartridges. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.5">The IoT can monitor the customer’s habits and suggest the optimal model for the consumable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.6">It can also increase the probability of reordering because an order can be placed automatically by </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.471.1">a device.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.1">There are cases where businesses provide IoT applications with their hardware for free because its purpose is to monetize by collecting and reselling users’ data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.2">This pertains to the situation involving driving habit monitoring devices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.3">While these devices offer valuable insights to users, insurance companies derive significant benefits by analyzing driving patterns across a large number of individuals. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.4">Introducing this model can be seen as an expansion of your primary business, where you initially focus on addressing the needs of your end users and subsequently explore opportunities to generate revenue from their data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.5">These two approaches can coexist harmoniously as long as you prioritize transparency with your customers regarding data usage and take necessary measures to safeguard </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.1">their privacy.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.815.1">We have seen that two electronic devices can use the internet to interact with each other and exchange information, without the need for a direct physical connection between them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.815.2">Nodes can be interfaced with other objects and cloud applications and this architecture allows the implementation of smart solutions in different markets and with huge benefits </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.816.1">for users.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.817.1">We’ve seen the architecture of an IoT solution, the different telecommunication technologies, and the security </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.818.1">aspects involved.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.819.1">We have talked about methods to protect your intellectual property against the duplication of your product and how to adopt open source libraries without the need to release your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.820.1">source code.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.821.1">Finally, please respect the Arduino trademarks when implementing a commercial solution based on the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.822.1">Arduino ecosystem.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.823.1">All this information is necessary to understand how things behind an IoT application work and for you to consider the right approach for your next </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.824.1">IoT solution.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.825.1">Before stepping into the next chapter, with the first example of an IoT project based on the Arduino IoT Cloud, it’s worth recapping the main steps to engineer a good </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.1">IoT solution:</span></span></p>
