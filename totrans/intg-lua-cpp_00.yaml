- en: Lua is a simple and efficient scripting language that has been widely adopted
    in the gaming industry and embedded systems. In those two fields, a large portion
    of the control programs and applications are written in C++.

- en: Who this book is for
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for C++ programmers who are willing to learn how to integrate Lua
    into their projects. This book can also benefit Lua programmers who want to learn
    C++ by combining exercises on C++ with relevant topics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A basic understanding of the C++ programming language is required to fully understand
    and engage with the book. Although a deeper understanding of C++ may make the
    book easier to read, you can learn the advanced C++ techniques you encounter in
    this book on your own through online research.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: No prior knowledge of the Lua programming language is needed, although some
    Lua experience might be beneficial. You can refer to the Lua reference manual
    frequently to learn the Lua programming language as you progress through this
    book.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book will build a Lua executor. Each chapter will focus on one area and
    add one feature group to the executor. The exercises at the end of the chapter,
    if provided, are a crucial part to prepare for the next chapter. For the more
    experienced readers among you, this is why some code might not get implemented
    optimally in the initial chapters. This will help you stay focused on the topics
    at hand.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book assumes that you know C++ and are willing to learn about Lua. If you
    have no intention of being a Lua programmer, you only need to focus on the related
    Lua concepts rather than Lua coding.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because this is not a dedicated book to teach either of the programming languages,
    when you see the usage of a certain API that you are not familiar with, you can
    get more information from a Lua or a C++ reference manual. You can enrich your
    learning journey by frequently bridging your knowledge gaps through online research.
