<p>Since their first appearance, multiplayer games have revolutionized the gaming industry, providing players with a new way to experience gaming. Unlike traditional single-player games, multiplayer games allow players to engage and interact with each other in real time, providing a dynamic and engaging social experience.</p>
<p>In recent years, advancements in technology have made multiplayer gaming more accessible than ever before, and as a result, it has become one of the most popular genres in the world, with millions of players participating in multiplayer games every day across various platforms.</p>
<p>Game engines, such as Unreal Engine, have become increasingly popular among game developers because they provide many tools and features specifically designed to support high-quality multiplayer experiences, such as cross-platform multiplayer support and advanced lag compensation techniques.</p>
<p>Unreal Engine also has a large and active community of game developers, providing support, resources, and opportunities for collaboration and networking, meaning that, if you are interested in networked game development, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t give it a try!</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>If you are a game programmer or specifically an Unreal Engine developer, with little or no knowledge of video game networking systems, and want to delve deep into this topic, then this book is for you.</p>
<p>Developers who are proficient in other game engines and are interested in understanding the principles of the Unreal multiplayer system will also benefit from this book; however, a basic knowledge of Unreal Engine and C++ is strongly recommended.</p>
<p>A passion for multiplayer games will help you get the most out of this book.</p>
