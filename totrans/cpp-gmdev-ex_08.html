<p class="mce-root">Using the game-development concepts learned in Section 2, in this section we will create a 3D physics puzzle game using modern OpenGL and the bullet physics engine. We will learn about the graphics pipeline and the creation of 3D objects using vertex and index buffers. Then we will add them to the scene using vertex and fragment shaders, add textures, and use text rendering, including the bullet physics library, lighting models, post-processing effects, and 3D particle-system generation. The following chapters are covered in this section:</p>
