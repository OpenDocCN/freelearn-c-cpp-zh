    the details regarding different open source licenses and responsibilities while
    using these tools and related code in your projects. We also talked about intellectual
    property, which is very much related to commercial usage and preventing your product
    from being a copy or clone. This is the first chapter of the book and we have
    discussed in depth what the IoT is, its benefits, communication protocols and
    technologies, and a lot of other topics, giving you a broad overview of IoT architecture
    before starting the remainder of the book.

  zh: 摘要
- en: We have seen that two electronic devices can use the internet to interact with
    each other and exchange information, without the need for a direct physical connection
    between them. Nodes can be interfaced with other objects and cloud applications
    and this architecture allows the implementation of smart solutions in different
    markets and with huge benefits for users.
