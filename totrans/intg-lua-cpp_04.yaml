    string argument that returns one string value. In this chapter, we will learn
    how to call a Lua function with any type and any number of arguments and support
    multiple return values. To do this, we need to find a convenient way to map Lua
    types to C++ types. Then, we will build upon this type system to improve our Lua
    executor step by step. During this process, you will continue to deepen your understanding
    of the Lua stack and learn how to use some of the modern C++ features to integrate
    Lua.

    discarding extra return values or padding with nil. This magic number is the only

    return values onto the stack, so the new elements in the stack are the return
    values. We have implemented `popValue` to pop the top of the stack. We need another

    when it sees a nil value. If you move `LuaNil::make()` to the middle of the list,
    you will miss more return values. This is expected. This is a Lua thing. Similar
