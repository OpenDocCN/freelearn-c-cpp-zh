                    <h1 class="header-title">Basic Prototyping</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Prototyping is where all of our ideas come to life. When I started working with microcontrollers I really wanted to design and build my whole project and watch it magically work. I realized that all I was doing was overwhelming myself and quickly learned how to break the larger projects into much smaller projects. I could then create prototypes for each of these smaller projects to verify they worked before incorporating them into the larger project.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where to set up a work area</li>
<li>All about breadboards</li>
<li>What Dupont (jumper) cables are</li>
<li>How to prototype a project</li>
</ul>
<p>Prototypes are used to prove the specifications for a working concept or process rather than theoretical ones. Prototypes, as we are referring to it in this book, is a model to test a concept or process. Prototyping is the process of creating and testing the prototypes.</p>
<p>When working with the Arduino and other microcontrollers, it is important to understand how to prototype especially when working with larger projects. These larger projects can usually be broken up into multiple smaller projects. We can then prototype each of these smaller projects to make sure they work as expected before incorporating them into the larger project. Before we look at how to prototype, we need to set up a good work area to do prototyping in.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Setting up a work area</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When you first start building projects with the Arduino, it is important to find a good work area to not only build these projects but also store the parts and the prototypes that you create. When I first started using microcontrollers like the Arduino I used the living room table as my work area while I was watching baseball on the TV and quickly realized that the living room was not the ideal place to work in because all of the tools and components needed to build these projects quickly took over the room. In this section, we will look at what makes a good work area.</p>
<p>The first item we need to consider when deciding on a work area is static electricity. While static electricity isn't as big as a problem as a lot of people make it out to be, it is something that we need to consider when setting up an area to do prototyping in. I personally have not lost a single electronic component to static electricity in the past fifteen to twenty years; however, I also don't wear fluffy sweaters, pet my dog and rub my feet on shag carpet while I am working with electronic components. As a general rule, we should try to avoid areas that are prone to static like areas with thick carpet.</p>
<p>Some tips to avoid static electricity when working with the Arduino or other electronic components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Touch something metal to discharge any static electricity that has built up prior to touching an electronic component.</li>
<li>Avoid, if possible, having carpet in your work area or wearing rubber soled shoes.</li>
<li>Be careful of the material of your clothing. Wool sweaters or socks can cause static buildup, so opt for cotton instead.</li>
<li>Avoid petting any furry pets while working.</li>
<li>If your work area is dry, use a humidifier to add moister to the air.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another concern when picking a work area is to have a table or bench large enough to hold your projects and preferably one that you can store the projects on for extended periods of time. When I was using the living room table as my work area, I quickly realized how inconvenient it was to have to clean up every night.</p>
<p>You will also want to make sure you have plenty of light in your work area. Even if your work area has sufficient lighting I would recommend investing in a clip-on table light that you can clip to the edge of the table when you need extra lighting. Trust me there will be times when you need extra lighting to make the small print on the electronic components stand out.</p>
<p>The final thing you will want to look for in your work area is plenty of storage. The more prototyping you do the more parts you will acquire, and you will need someplace close by to store them. When I first started working with microcontrollers, I stored most of my small parts in a couple small plastic toolboxes. This worked out very well in the beginning, but I eventually outgrew those toolboxes and bought some small parts cabinets for the smaller components and larger plastic storage bins for larger components.</p>
<p>Before you begin working with the Arduino, it is well worth the time to set up a proper work area. I did not do that in the beginning and it made building my prototypes significantly harder. Now let's look at two of the most important items, after the microcontroller, that you will be using when you are prototyping. The two items are the breadboard and Dupont cables.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Using a solderless breadboard</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>It is a good idea to avoid connecting LEDs, resistors and other electronic components directly to the Arduino because you can easily damage the headers on the Arduino and the circuit quickly turn into an unorganized mess. When prototyping, it is a lot easier to connect the components together using a solderless breadboard.</p>
<p>A solderless breadboard enables us to connect electronic components together without the need to solder. You can get a good solderless MB-102 breadboard for under ten US dollars. They are also reusable, which makes them perfect for creating prototypes and experimenting with circuit designs.</p>
<p>I would recommend not skimping too much on your breadboards because you will be using them so much. You can find some very cheap and small breadboards like the one in the following photograph; however, it is a lot harder to organize your circuit design with these smaller breadboards. I do use these for quick and small prototyping, but I would not recommend having these as your main breadboards.</p>
<div><img src="img/da1c7e80-f90f-470e-b4e9-c96b3b8878ff.png" style="width:13.67em;height:13.67em;"/></div>
<p>For prototyping with the Arduino, it also isn't necessary to get breadboards with built-in power connectors like the one shown in the following photograph:</p>
<div><img src="img/c01d33a2-7b6d-4634-8418-e48576c5e346.png" style="width:30.08em;height:19.50em;"/></div>
<p>I would recommend getting an MB 102 breadboard like the one shown in the following photograph:</p>
<div><img src="img/eb19d6e6-0ff3-496d-96ce-7f42178a4119.png" style="width:43.83em;height:15.83em;"/></div>
<p>The MB-102 breadboard contains two positive and two negative power pails which makes it easy to connect the power and ground pins from the Arduino to the electronic components needed for the prototype. In the following photograph, we highlighted the four power rails where the rails highlighted with red are the positive rails and the rails highlighted in black are the negative rails. The positive rails are usually marked, on the breadboard, with a + sign and the negative rail is marked with a - sign:</p>
<div><img src="img/d66bfef7-6943-40de-83c5-758bbc030efe.png" style="width:45.67em;height:16.50em;"/></div>
<p>The power rails run horizontally across the breadboard where all of the connectors along the horizontal rail are usually connected together. This means, as an example, that if we connect one of the voltage pins on the Arduino to any of the pins along the positive rail, then all of the connectors along that rail will have to be connected to the voltage pin on the Arduino.</p>
<p>The pins in the middle of the board are connected together vertically; however, the connection does not cross the center of the breadboard. The following photograph shows how the pins in the middle of the board are connected:</p>
<div><img src="img/7fc25b9b-a9a7-4228-a79b-15963c59308c.png" style="width:146.25em;height:53.00em;"/></div>
<p>While the preceding photograph only shows how six of the vertical rows are connected, all of the vertical rows are connected in this manner. One thing to make note of is how we described the MB-102 breadboard is how the majority of them are configured; however, not all of them are configured in this manner.</p>
<p>Always read the specifications when you purchase components like a breadboard to make sure you know if there is anything different about the one you are purchasing. It can save you hours of troubleshooting.</p>
<p>If we pull off the back of the breadboard we can get a better view of how the pins are connected. The following photograph shows what the back of a breadboard looks like if we peel off the padding:</p>
<div><img src="img/6ae51f11-8dae-4b63-b80f-5a0a0bca202b.png" style="width:49.00em;height:20.58em;"/></div>
<p>When working with the Arduino, we can usually run power and ground directly from the Arduino to the power rails on the breadboard; however, there are times where we may need external power. For those times, they do make external power adapters that can connect directly to the breadboard and enable us to use USB, AC adapters, and other power sources to power the projects. The following photograph shows one such adapter and also how we would connect these power adapters to the breadboard:</p>
<div><img src="img/e8ec2ca8-30e7-4570-a166-ec25429fcaa2.png" style="width:44.58em;height:40.00em;"/></div>
<p>Now the question is how you connect components together using the breadboard and the answer is Dupont (jumper) cables.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Dupont (jumper) cables</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Dupont cables, also known as jumper wire, are used to wire components together when using a solderless breadboard. These cables come in three types: male-male, male-female and female-female. When using these cables with a solderless breadboard, and the Arduino, we typically use cables that have male connectors on both ends; however, there are some components that already have male connectors on them, so it is worthwhile having some male-female cables as well. The following photograph shows what the male connectors look like at the end of the Dupont cables:</p>
<div><img src="img/905e8669-7826-4bd7-8c14-488aed813fc4.png" style="width:25.50em;height:34.17em;"/></div>
<p>It is pretty cheap to purchase premade Dupont cables but if you want to customize the length you can make them yourself by purchasing a crimper and some ends. These cables are not that hard to make but I would recommend starting off by purchasing premade ones.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Prototyping</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Prototypes are used to prove the specifications for a working concept or process rather than theoretical ones. A prototype, as we are referring to it in this book, is a model to test a concept or process. For simple concepts or process, we may create a prototype for the whole system but for my complex systems, we will want to break the system down into individual components and create a prototype for each component.</p>
<p>Prototypes with the Arduino usually consist of one Arduino microcontroller with one breadboard used to connect the components to the Arduino. For these prototypes, I use a holder that I designed and printed out with my 3D printer. The following photograph shows the holder with an Arduino Uno, Nano and a breadboard in it:</p>
<div><img src="img/ccc0e8ab-b514-4f5f-86ee-a248069aff46.png" style="width:39.08em;height:29.33em;"/></div>
<p>The holder is designed to hold an MB-102 breadboard, an Arduino Nano and either an Arduino Uno or Mega. If you have access to a 3D printer I included the STL file for this holder in the downloadable code for this book so you can print one for yourself. Holders like this are especially useful when we need to move the prototype because it keeps everything together and organized.</p>
<p>Before we can start building a prototype, we need to have an idea of what we want to build. This idea may be something as simple as blinking an LED or as complex and creating an autonomous robot. The idea is always the first step when beginning a project.</p>
<p>The second step is to break up the idea into the different building blocks that were discussed in <a href="48ede881-c312-454b-8351-06f6a4734c52.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Basic Electronics</em>. After we have broken up the project into the different blocks we would then diagram the circuits that need to be prototyped. After the diagrams are complete, we can then begin building the prototypes. Let's look at these steps a little closer, starting with the four building blocks of an electronic circuit.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Four building blocks of an electronic project</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In <a href="48ede881-c312-454b-8351-06f6a4734c52.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Basic Electronics</em>, we discussed the four building blocks of an electronic project. The following diagram shows these four blocks:</p>
<div><img src="img/5fccbb5d-fe78-418d-9f57-4df6fc52a3b6.png" style="width:17.33em;height:20.92em;"/></div>
<p>It is really easy to break a simple prototype, like a circuit to turn an LED on and off, into the individual blocks but for more complex projects it becomes harder because of the different components.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>By separating the components into the different blocks, it becomes easier to see how to break a larger project into separate prototypes. For example, if we wanted to create an autonomous robot we could see that one of the inputs is a sonic rangefinder that will detect obstacles in front of the robot, while the output that will be affected by the input from the rangefinder would be the motors that move the robot. In this example, we would probably want to change the direction of the motors if the rangefinders detect an obstacle in front. We could then create a prototype to test how this particular system worked.</p>
<p>In this step, we are defining what the inputs and outputs are and what outputs are trigger based on these inputs. This is also where we define most of the logic for the project, so we can set up the prototypes.</p>
<p>When you first start building these projects, you will want to create a diagram for each project. Once you gain experience, for most smaller to medium projects, you will not need to write anything down at this step. This step will become just breaking the project down in your heads and figuring out what the inputs and outputs are. For larger projects, we may want to create flowcharts and even diagrams that show how we want everything to work together. Once we get into the projects in this book, we will see different ways to separate the components into their individual blocks and how to define the logic for the inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>After we have broken our project down into the individual prototypes with the separate inputs and output circuits, we would then want to create circuit diagrams for each of these prototypes.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating a diagram</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Once we have defined the inputs and outputs of the circuit and the logic for the project, the next step is to diagram the circuits. We will want to make sure that we diagram all of the circuits that we create even the most basic ones. This will help us figure out resistors needed and to visualize how we want to organize and connect the component.</p>
<p>When creating the circuit diagrams, I would recommend using the Fritzing software that was described in <a href="de9d9edf-fdf1-410b-bb8a-98ef4b185166.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Circuit Diagrams</em>. Now let's look at the final step, building the prototype.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Building the prototype</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The final step is actually building a working prototype. This is where all of the hard work from the first three steps come together and you are able to see if the prototype works as expected.</p>
<p>All of us would prefer to skip the first few steps and go right to building the prototype; however, you will be more successful and damage fewer parts if you take your time and go through each of these steps when creating your prototypes.</p>
<p>Now let's see how we would go through these steps and build our first prototype. You will want to follow along and build this prototype yourself because we will be using it in the next couple of chapters as we learn to program the Arduino.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">First prototype</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The first prototype that we will build is pretty simple and designed to be used in the next couple chapters where we learn to program the Arduino. This prototype will have one button that will be used to turn a LED on or off, another LED that we can turn on or off and a TMP36 temperature sensor.</p>
<p>In this prototype, we will have two inputs (a push button and temperature sensor) and two outputs (the two LEDs). We will use the 5V output from the Arduino to power the components. Here is the Fritzing diagram of this prototype:</p>
<div><img src="img/5e28b322-bcae-4c33-bc7e-44dd47dd62d7.png" style="width:44.25em;height:36.50em;"/></div>
<p>In this diagram, starting from left to right, we have the button, the two LEDs, and the TMP36 temperature sensor. Each of the LEDs has the same 330-ohm resistor that used in <a href="de9d9edf-fdf1-410b-bb8a-98ef4b185166.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Circuit Diagram</em>. Since the power from the Arduino is only 5 volts, we could lower the value of the resistor to 100 ohms, but the 330-ohm resistors will work fine as well.</p>
<p>The resistor that we are using the button is called a pull-down resistor because one end is connected to ground. A digital logic circuit can really have three states: high, low, and floating. The floating state occurs when the pin is neither pulled high or low but is instead left floating. In this floating state, the microcontroller could unpredictably interpret this state as either high or low. To solve this issue, a pull-down resistor is used to pull the floating state low.</p>
<p>If the resistor was connected to the voltage supply, rather than ground, it would be considered a pull-up resistor. A pull-up resistor works in the same manner as a pull-down resistor but rather than pulling the floating stated low, a pull-up resistor pulls it high. We will be using pull-down and pull-up resistors in several projects in this book.</p>
<p>The push button is connected to pin 12 of the Arduino; therefore, we will be able to read the state of the button by checking the state of pin 12. The LEDs are connected to pins 11 and 3; therefore, we will be able to turn them on by sending a digital high to those pins or turn them off by sending a digital low. Finally, the output pin on the TMP36 temperature sensor (the middle pin) is connected to the analog 5 pin since the output from the sensor in analog. The voltage and ground pins on the TMP36 temperature sensor are connected to the voltage and ground rails on the breadboard.</p>
<p>The Fritzing diagram makes the prototype look so nice and organized; however, most prototypes do not look like that. The following is what the prototype looked like when I built it for this book:</p>
<div><img src="img/f78a7fa3-e316-492b-90cd-cf5a22d36703.png" style="width:32.92em;height:24.75em;"/></div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>It is nice to have your prototype neat and looking good, but it is not necessary as long as you can work with it. It is especially hard to have the prototype neat when you only have one or two lengths of Dupont (jumper) cables.</p>
<p>You will also notice the short wires that run across the power rails. On this breadboard, the power rails are not connected all the way across horizontally. This is an example of a breadboard that is configured a little differently. You can tell that the power rails do not run all the way across because the red and blue lines on the breadboard have a gap halfway across; therefore, we used small cables to connect the two sides. There are times that we need different power sources so having the power rails split like this can be very helpful but for this prototype, since we are using the same power source for all components, we connected the power rails together.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this chapter, we looked at the basics of prototyping and what steps we should take when we create prototypes. The sample prototype that we did at the end of this chapter was pretty basic, but we still went through each of the steps to make sure we had everything correct. We will be walking through each of these steps in the projects chapters later in this book.</p>
<p>Now that we have created our first prototype, we need to learn how to program the Arduino. The next three chapters are written to teach you how to program the Arduino. We will start off by showing you how to download and install the Arduino IDE.</p>
