# Section 4: Mobile Deployment and Device Creation

Compiling for, and deploying to, mobile and embedded devices can be challenging. In the case of embedded devices, readers may need to deploy to a barebones machine—operating system and all. The different methods to deploy cross-platform applications to mobile and embedded devices, as well as how to create a boot to Qt for a device using a Raspberry Pi, will be covered in this section.
