			<p>Game development is becoming more accessible as game engines become more powerful. Tools and pipelines that were only available to big companies and wealthy individuals are now freely available to everyone with a computer. Anyone can feel the satisfaction of creating their own game and having others <span class="No-Break">play it.</span></p>
			<p>This is exactly what we are going to achieve in this book. We will go from knowing absolutely nothing about programming or developing games to creating our very first game and even a <span class="No-Break">little beyond.</span></p>
			<p>During the first part of this book, we will learn all about setting up Godot and programming. This might be a little more abstract, but I’ll try to give clear examples and keep you engaged with exercises and experiments you can do <span class="No-Break">for yourself.</span></p>
			<p>The second part of this book will be way more practical as we will dive neck-deep into creating our very own video game! We’ll learn how to use the Godot editor to create interesting game scenes <span class="No-Break">and scenarios.</span></p>
			<p>In the last part of this book, we’ll take our programming skills to the next level and learn all about advanced topics, such as more powerful concepts, programming patterns, the filesystem, and <span class="No-Break">much more.</span></p>
			<p>But before we get there, nothing is more satisfying than starting a new project! It represents a blank slate with endless possibilities. By the end of this chapter, we’ll have created our very own blank slate and written our first lines of code. But first, I’d like to take some time to introduce the Godot game engine and open-source software <span class="No-Break">in general.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following <span class="No-Break">main topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Godot Engine and <span class="No-Break">open-source software</span></li>
				<li>Downloading the engine from the <span class="No-Break">official website</span></li>
				<li>Creating our <span class="No-Break">first project</span></li>
				<li>How to join <span class="No-Break">the community</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>As this book aims to get you from knowing nothing about programming and game development to an intermediate level, there are no technical requirements. So, instead, I’ll guide you through all (or at least most) of the steps required for <span class="No-Break">creating games.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Example project and code</p>
			<p class="callout">You can find the example project and code for this book in this book’s GitHub <span class="No-Break">repository: </span><a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-GDScript-by-Developing-a-Game-with-Godot-4/tree/main/chapter01"><span class="No-Break">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-GDScript-by-Developing-a-Game-with-Godot-4/tree/main/chapter01</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>Godot game engine and open-source software</h1>
			<p>We’ll be using the Godot game engine, which I presume<a id="_idIndexMarker000"/> you already know exists as this is a book specifically about that engine. But let me give you some more insight into its history<a id="_idIndexMarker001"/> and what <span class="No-Break">open-source means<a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>Some background on the engine</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Godot Engine</strong> is a piece <a id="_idIndexMarker002"/>of open-source software that lets people from all experience levels and walks of life create games. The project was started in 2007 by Juan Linietsky and Ariel Manzur as an in-house engine for several Argentinian game studios. In late 2014, the engine got open-sourced, giving everyone free access to the code. Since then, it has gained lots of traction and is currently one of the most used game engines on the market. Many commercial games have been released or are under development using the engine. Examples of released games are Brotato, Dome Keeper, Case of the Golden Idol, and <span class="No-Break">Cassette Beasts.</span></p>
			<p>For those of you wondering, yes, the engine is named after the theatrical piece <em class="italic">Waiting for Godot</em>, by Samuel Beckett. This choice of name is because people will always be waiting for the next version or new feature, resulting in an endless cycle <span class="No-Break">of waiting.</span></p>
			<p>While on the topic of the engine’s name, let’s also get the pronunciation out of the way. In short, there is no standard way of pronouncing Godot. Because of the association with the play’s title, which is written in French, some people say it should be “go-do,” without emphasis on any syllable. But most English speakers would say “GOH-doh” and stress the first syllable. Then, there is the stream of people that pronounce it “go-DOT,” mainly because it sounds similar to the word “robot” and the engine’s logo is a blue robot. But I notice that I say Godot differently each time. So, to cut a long story short, pronounce it however<a id="_idIndexMarker003"/> you like. Just use roughly the <span class="No-Break">same lette<a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>rs.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>What is open-source software?</h2>
			<p>As mentioned earlier, Godot<a id="_idIndexMarker004"/> is open-source, meaning<a id="_idIndexMarker005"/> the engine’s source code is freely available. Because everyone has access, people can alter this code to their liking. Once they have tweaked enough parameters or developed a new feature, they can ask the creator of the software to include these tweaks or features in the original project. The creator will then review what the other person has done, alter it a bit if needed, and then add it to the code of the original software. This process creates a virtuous circle that results in a win-win situation <span class="No-Break">for everyone:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><em class="italic">The software’s creator</em> can grow the code faster because everyone <span class="No-Break">chips in</span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">People with technical knowledge</em> can add the features they miss, making it fit <span class="No-Break">their needs</span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">The end user</em> gets a much better and more stable <span class="No-Break">end product</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>But not every open-source<a id="_idIndexMarker006"/> project is created equal. Each <strong class="bold">free open-source software</strong> (<strong class="bold">FOSS</strong>) comes with its respective license. This license dictates how you can or should use the software. Some of these are pretty restrictive, but in the case of Godot Engine, we are in luck: we can do anything without significant restrictions. We only have to attribute the creators on the credit page of <span class="No-Break">our games.</span></p>
			<p>Alright – we know what Godot Engine is, how to pronounce its name (or not), and why FOSS is so awesome. Let’s dive right into preparing our <span class="No-Break">development enviro<a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>nment!</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Getting and preparing Godot</h1>
			<p>Before we can do any<a id="_idIndexMarker007"/> programming, we’ll need<a id="_idIndexMarker008"/> to set up the development environment. That is what we will do in this section, beginning with downloading the engine and creating a <span class="No-Break">new <a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>project.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Downloading the engine</h2>
			<p>Getting the engine is relatively<a id="_idIndexMarker009"/> easy and only requires a <span class="No-Break">few steps:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>First, we’ll need to download a copy of the software. We can do this <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://godotengine.org/download"><span class="No-Break">https://godotengine.org/download</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.1 – The download page of Godot Engine 4.0 for the Windows platform</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Usually, the page will automatically direct you to the download page of the operating system you are using to browse the website and you can press the big blue button in the middle of the page to download the engine. If it doesn’t, you’ll need to select your computer’s platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, and so on) when scrolling down <span class="No-Break">the page.</span></li>
			</ol>

Otherwise, if you are anything like me, you might accidentally remove it in a clean-up spree of the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Downloads</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> folder.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>For this book, we will be using version 4.0.0, as it just came out. But any version with a 4 at the beginning should work fine. Unfortunately, this is not a guarantee. We’ll do our best to keep this book’s content up to date, but open-source software can <span class="No-Break">move quickly.</span></p>
			<p>The download size of Godot Engine is tiny, about 30 to 100 MB, depending on your platform. This small package is all we need to create awesome games. Compare this to Unity’s 10 GB and Unreal Engine’s whopping 34 GB! Of course, these all come without any assets, such as visuals<a id="_idIndexMarker012"/> <span class="No-Break">or audio.</span></p>
			<p>That’s it for getting the engine. You don’t need to install anything else to <span class="No-Break">use it.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Other versions of the engine</p>
			<p class="callout">Because Godot Engine is open-source, there are also a lot of complete game projects that are open-source too. If you ever want to run one of those game projects on your machine, make sure you use the correct version of Godot; otherwise, the game could crash and weird things might happen. You can find and download<a id="_idIndexMarker013"/> all official versions of Godot <span class="No-Break">from </span><a href="https://godotengine.org/download/"><span class="No-Break">https://godotengine.org/download/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>Creating a new project</h2>
			<p>Now, let’s go ahead and create<a id="_idIndexMarker014"/> our first Godot Engine project, hopefully with many others to come in <span class="No-Break">the future!</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>First, open the engine by double-clicking the file we downloaded in the <em class="italic">Downloading the engine</em> section. A screen like this will <span class="No-Break">greet you:</span></li>

			<ol>
				<li value="3">Call the project <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Hello World</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>Select a <strong class="bold">Project Path</strong> area to put the project. Create a new folder by using the <strong class="bold">Create Folder</strong> button or use an existing one but note that this folder should preferably be empty. Although the folder you select can contain files already, starting from a clean directory will keep everything we do <span class="No-Break">more organized.</span></li>
				<li>Select <strong class="bold">Compatibility</strong> under the <strong class="bold">Renderer</strong> category. The compatibility<a id="_idIndexMarker016"/> renderer is made to make sure that our game can run on a wide variety of hardware and supports older graphics cards and web exports. The Forward+ renderer is used for cutting-edge graphics but demands a better graphics card, while the mobile renderer is optimized for mobile devices. For what we are doing, the compatibility renderer is more than capable enough and it makes sure that we can export to the biggest amount of <span class="No-Break">platforms possible.</span></li>
				<li>Finally, press <strong class="bold">Create &amp; </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Edit</strong></span><span class="No-Break">!</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Godot will now set up the basic structure of our project within the selected folder and, after a few seconds, show us <span class="No-Break">the editor:</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.6 – The Godot Engine 4.0 editor</p>
			<p>At first sight, this may look quite daunting – little windows everywhere, multiple controls here and there, and a giant 3D space<a id="_idIndexMarker017"/> in the middle. Don’t worry. By the end of this book, you’ll know the ins and outs of almost everything that lies before you. You’re in <span class="No-Break">good hands.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Fun fact</p>
			<p class="callout">The Godot developers used Godot Engine to create the editor itself. Try to wrap your brain around that! They did this to easily extend and maintain <span class="No-Break">the editor.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>Light mode</h2>
			<p>Because of the limitations<a id="_idIndexMarker018"/> of printed media, dark screenshots might look grainy and unsharp. That is why, from this point on, we’ll switch to the light version of Godot. There is no difference but the appearance of <span class="No-Break">the editor.</span></p>
			<p>If you also want to follow along in light mode, perform these <span class="No-Break">optional steps:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to <strong class="bold">Editor</strong> | <strong class="bold">Editor Settings…</strong> at the top of <span class="No-Break">the screen:</span></li>
			</ol>

			<p>With that out of the way, let’s get back<a id="_idIndexMarker020"/> to creating a game by learning how to creat<a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>e <span class="No-Break">a scene.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Creating the main scene</h2>
			<p>Let’s continue by setting<a id="_idIndexMarker021"/> up our <span class="No-Break">first scene:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the leftmost panel of <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.10</em>, which shows the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> panel, select <strong class="bold">2D Scene</strong>. This button will set up the scene for a 2D game, as <span class="No-Break">shown here:</span></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer019">
					<img alt="Figure 1.10 – Selecting 2D Scene in the left panel" src="image/B19358_01_11.jpg"/>

			<p class="list-inset">You’ll see that there is one node in the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> panel called <strong class="bold">Node2D</strong> and that the 3D space in the middle<a id="_idIndexMarker022"/> window got replaced with a <span class="No-Break">2D plane.</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Right-click the node called <strong class="bold">Node2D</strong> and rename it <strong class="source-inline">Main</strong>. This node will be our main node to work with <span class="No-Break">for now:</span></li>

			<ol>
				<li value="4">We’ll be asked where<a id="_idIndexMarker023"/> we wish to save the scene. Choose the project’s root folder and name the <span class="No-Break">file </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">main.tscn</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></li>

			<p>That’s all for creating our first scene. What we just added is a node. These nodes represent everything in Godot. Images, sounds, menus, special effects – everything is a node. You can think of them as game objects, each having a separate function in the game. The player could be a node, just like enemies <span class="No-Break">or coins.</span></p>
			<p>On the other hand, scenes are collections of nodes or collections of game objects. For now, you can think of scenes as levels. For a level, you need a player node, some enemy nodes, and a bunch of coin nodes; the collection<a id="_idIndexMarker024"/> of these is a scene. It’s like nodes are the paint and scenes are <span class="No-Break">our canvases.</span></p>
			<p>We’ll come back to nodes and scenes throughout <span class="No-Break">t<a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>his book.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>A brief UI overview</h2>
			<p>Now would be a great time to review <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>some of the more prominent features of the editor’s UI. As we saw earlier, it looks something <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer023">
					<img alt="Figure 1.14 – An overview of the editor" src="image/B19358_01_15.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.14 – An overview of the editor</p>
			<p>The prominent elements of the editor<a id="_idIndexMarker026"/> are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Scene Tree</strong> area shows all the nodes in the current scene. For now, there is <span class="No-Break">only one.</span></li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">FileSystem</strong> area provides access to the files within the <span class="No-Break">project folder.</span></li>
				<li>The middle window is the <strong class="bold">currently active main editor</strong>. For now, we can see the 2D editor, which will allow us to place nodes in 2D space within <span class="No-Break">the scene.</span></li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> area can be found entirely to the right and shows the properties for the currently selected node. If you open some accordion menus, such as the <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> section, you will find multiple settings associated with the <span class="No-Break">selected node.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Nodes by themselves don’t do much. They provide us with specific functionalities, such as showing an image, playing a sound, and more, but they still need some higher logic to bind them into the actual game. That’s why<a id="_idIndexMarker027"/> we can extend their functionality and behavior <span class="No-Break">w<a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>ith scripts.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Writing our first script</h2>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">script</strong> is a piece of code<a id="_idIndexMarker028"/> that adds logic to a node, such as moving an image or deciding when to play <span class="No-Break">that sound.</span></p>
			<p>We’ll create our first script now. Right-click the <strong class="source-inline">Main</strong> node again and choose <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Attach Script</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>

			<p>A pop-up window will appear. Keep everything as-is. The important thing to note is that the selected language is <strong class="bold">GDScript</strong>, the programming language we’ll learn throughout this book. The rest is not very important for now.

			<p>This is the <strong class="bold">Script</strong> editor. We will spend most of our time here learning how to program during the first part of <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
			<p>As you may have noticed, the middle window is context-dependent. It can be a <strong class="bold">2D</strong>, <strong class="bold">3D</strong>, or <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Script</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> editor:</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.18 – The different main windows</p>
			<p>To switch between these different editors, use the buttons at the top of <span class="No-Break">the screen.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">AssetLib</p>
			<p class="callout">The last tab, <strong class="bold">AssetLib</strong>, is useful for getting pre-made assets from the Asset Library of Godot. This library can provide custom nodes, scripts, or any other assets for your project directly from within Godot Editor. We won’t cover the 3D editor or AssetLib, but it is good to know they <span class="No-Break">are there.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">All of the assets on <strong class="bold">AssetLib</strong> are open-source and thus completely free to use! Hurray <span class="No-Break">for FOSS!</span></p>
			<p>If you have tried to change<a id="_idIndexMarker030"/> to the different editors, return to the <strong class="bold">Script</strong> editor so that we can create our first script and ensure everything is ready. The code within the script looks like this for <span class="No-Break">the moment:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
extends Node2D
# Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
func _ready():
   pass # Replace with function body.
# Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame.
func _process(delta):
   pass</pre>			<p>Again, don’t worry about all the different commands and specific syntax here. We will cover everything in due time. For now, it’s enough to know that this is a script written in GDScript, the scripting language <span class="No-Break">of Godot.</span></p>
			<p>To create the classic <strong class="bold">“Hello, World”</strong> program, which is a staple for beginner programmers, all we must do is change the line containing <strong class="source-inline">pass # Replace with function body.</strong> to <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
   print("Hello, World")</pre>			<p>This line of code will show the text <strong class="source-inline">"Hello, World;"</strong> it will not use a printer to print out anything. We can also throw <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>away a bunch of the code we<a id="_idTextAnchor035"/><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/> don’t need. The whole script should now look <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
extends Node2D
func _ready():
<strong class="bold">   print("Hello, World")</strong></pre>			<p>Notice that there must be a <em class="italic">tab</em> in front of the <strong class="source-inline">print</strong> statement we added. We add this <em class="italic">tab</em> because it shows that the line of code belongs to the <strong class="source-inline">_ready</strong> function. We call the practice of adding <em class="italic">tabs</em> in front of <span class="No-Break">lines </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">indentation</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Throughout this book, we haven’t used tabs in the text due to editorial reasons. We will use three spaces to represent one tab. This is why you’re better off not copying and pasting code from this book into the editor. The complete code for this book can be accessed and copied from this book’s GitHub repository (link in the <em class="italic">Technical </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">requirements</em></span><span class="No-Break"> section).</span></p>
			<p>All the lines within the <strong class="source-inline">_ready</strong> function will run when the node is ready, we’ll see what this means in more detail later. For now, it suffices to know that this function gets executed when the node is ready to <span class="No-Break">be used.</span></p>

				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer028">
					<img alt="Figure 1.19 – A function contains a code block" src="image/B19358_01_20.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.19 – A function contains a code block</p>
			<p>Functions are small groups of code<a id="_idIndexMarker032"/> a computer can execute. A function is always introduced by the <strong class="source-inline">func</strong> keyword, followed by the name of <span class="No-Break">the function.</span></p>
			<p>You can see that the pre-filled script also provided us with a <strong class="source-inline">_process</strong> function, which we will not use for now, so we deleted it. We’ll return to functions in <a href="B19358_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor164"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>. Remember that every line of code within the <strong class="source-inline">_ready</strong> function will execute from the moment our game runs and that a <em class="italic">tab</em> must precede <span class="No-Break">these lines.</span></p>
			<p>Use the <em class="italic">Tab</em> key to insert these tabs. The symbol on your keyboard looks like <span class="No-Break">this: </span><span class="No-Break">↹</span></p>
			<p>The last line of interest in the script says <strong class="source-inline">extends Node2D</strong>. This simply says that we are using <strong class="bold">Node2D</strong>, the type of node we added to the scene, as a base for the script to start from. Everything in the script is an extension of the functionality that <strong class="bold">Node2D</strong> completes. We’ll learn more about extending scripts and classes in <a href="B19358_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor164"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<p>Success! We wrote our <span class="No-Break">first script!</span></p>
			<p>As an experiment, try changing<a id="_idIndexMarker034"/> the text within the double quotes of <em class="italic">step 4</em> and rerun the program. You should see the new text printed in the <span class="No-Break">output window:</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we learned about Godot Engine, which is a FOSS. Then, we downloaded the engine for ourselves and created our first project. Lastly, we saw that the built-in programming language is GDScript and made our first <strong class="source-inline">"Hello, </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">World"</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> script.</span></p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we’ll start our journey of learning how to program. S<a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>ee <span class="No-Break">you there!</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Quiz time</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>What does the acronym FOSS mean and where is <span class="No-Break">it used?</span></li>
				<li>Is the Godot engine an <span class="No-Break">open-source project?</span></li>
				<li>What line of code did we add to show <em class="italic">“Hello, World”</em> in the Output? Why did we add a <em class="italic">tab</em> at the beginning of <span class="No-Break">this line?</span></li>
				<li>What are <em class="italic">nodes</em> in Godot Engine and how do they relate <span class="No-Break">to </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">scenes</em></span><span class="No-Break">?</span></li>
