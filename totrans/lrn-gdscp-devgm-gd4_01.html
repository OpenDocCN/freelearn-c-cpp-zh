			<p>Game development is becoming more accessible as game engines become more powerful. Tools and pipelines that were only available to big companies and wealthy individuals are now freely available to everyone with a computer. Anyone can feel the satisfaction of creating their own game and having others play it.</p>
			<p>This is exactly what we are going to achieve in this book. We will go from knowing absolutely nothing about programming or developing games to creating our very first game and even a little beyond.</p>
			<p>During the first part of this book, we will learn all about setting up Godot and programming. This might be a little more abstract, but I’ll try to give clear examples and keep you engaged with exercises and experiments you can do for yourself.</p>
			<p>The second part of this book will be way more practical as we will dive neck-deep into creating our very own video game! We’ll learn how to use the Godot editor to create interesting game scenes and scenarios.</p>
			<p>In the last part of this book, we’ll take our programming skills to the next level and learn all about advanced topics, such as more powerful concepts, programming patterns, the filesystem, and much more.</p>
			<p>But before we get there, nothing is more satisfying than starting a new project! It represents a blank slate with endless possibilities. By the end of this chapter, we’ll have created our very own blank slate and written our first lines of code. But first, I’d like to take some time to introduce the Godot game engine and open-source software in general.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Godot Engine and open-source software</li>
				<li>Downloading the engine from the official website</li>
				<li>Creating our first project</li>
				<li>How to join the community</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>As this book aims to get you from knowing nothing about programming and game development to an intermediate level, there are no technical requirements. So, instead, I’ll guide you through all (or at least most) of the steps required for creating games.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Example project and code</p>
			<p class="callout">You can find the example project and code for this book in this book’s GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-GDScript-by-Developing-a-Game-with-Godot-4/tree/main/chapter01">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-GDScript-by-Developing-a-Game-with-Godot-4/tree/main/chapter01</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>Godot game engine and open-source software</h1>
			<p>We’ll be using the Godot game engine, which I presume<a id="_idIndexMarker000"/> you already know exists as this is a book specifically about that engine. But let me give you some more insight into its history<a id="_idIndexMarker001"/> and what open-source means<a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>Some background on the engine</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Godot Engine</strong> is a piece <a id="_idIndexMarker002"/>of open-source software that lets people from all experience levels and walks of life create games. The project was started in 2007 by Juan Linietsky and Ariel Manzur as an in-house engine for several Argentinian game studios. In late 2014, the engine got open-sourced, giving everyone free access to the code. Since then, it has gained lots of traction and is currently one of the most used game engines on the market. Many commercial games have been released or are under development using the engine. Examples of released games are Brotato, Dome Keeper, Case of the Golden Idol, and Cassette Beasts.</p>
			<p>For those of you wondering, yes, the engine is named after the theatrical piece <em class="italic">Waiting for Godot</em>, by Samuel Beckett. This choice of name is because people will always be waiting for the next version or new feature, resulting in an endless cycle of waiting.</p>
			<p>While on the topic of the engine’s name, let’s also get the pronunciation out of the way. In short, there is no standard way of pronouncing Godot. Because of the association with the play’s title, which is written in French, some people say it should be “go-do,” without emphasis on any syllable. But most English speakers would say “GOH-doh” and stress the first syllable. Then, there is the stream of people that pronounce it “go-DOT,” mainly because it sounds similar to the word “robot” and the engine’s logo is a blue robot. But I notice that I say Godot differently each time. So, to cut a long story short, pronounce it however<a id="_idIndexMarker003"/> you like. Just use roughly the same lette<a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>rs.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>What is open-source software?</h2>
			<p>As mentioned earlier, Godot<a id="_idIndexMarker004"/> is open-source, meaning<a id="_idIndexMarker005"/> the engine’s source code is freely available. Because everyone has access, people can alter this code to their liking. Once they have tweaked enough parameters or developed a new feature, they can ask the creator of the software to include these tweaks or features in the original project. The creator will then review what the other person has done, alter it a bit if needed, and then add it to the code of the original software. This process creates a virtuous circle that results in a win-win situation for everyone:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em class="italic">The software’s creator</em> can grow the code faster because everyone chips in</li>
				<li><em class="italic">People with technical knowledge</em> can add the features they miss, making it fit their needs</li>
				<li><em class="italic">The end user</em> gets a much better and more stable end product</li>
			</ul>
			<p>But not every open-source<a id="_idIndexMarker006"/> project is created equal. Each <strong class="bold">free open-source software</strong> (<strong class="bold">FOSS</strong>) comes with its respective license. This license dictates how you can or should use the software. Some of these are pretty restrictive, but in the case of Godot Engine, we are in luck: we can do anything without significant restrictions. We only have to attribute the creators on the credit page of our games.</p>
			<p>Alright – we know what Godot Engine is, how to pronounce its name (or not), and why FOSS is so awesome. Let’s dive right into preparing our development enviro<a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>nment!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Getting and preparing Godot</h1>
			<p>Before we can do any<a id="_idIndexMarker007"/> programming, we’ll need<a id="_idIndexMarker008"/> to set up the development environment. That is what we will do in this section, beginning with downloading the engine and creating a new <a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>project.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Downloading the engine</h2>
			<p>Getting the engine is relatively<a id="_idIndexMarker009"/> easy and only requires a few steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>First, we’ll need to download a copy of the software. We can do this at <a href="https://godotengine.org/download">https://godotengine.org/download</a>.</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.1 – The download page of Godot Engine 4.0 for the Windows platform" src="img/B19358_01_01.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.1 – The download page of Godot Engine 4.0 for the Windows platform</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Usually, the page will automatically direct you to the download page of the operating system you are using to browse the website and you can press the big blue button in the middle of the page to download the engine. If it doesn’t, you’ll need to select your computer’s platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, and so on) when scrolling down the page.</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.2 – Select your computer’s platform if the download page was not able to detect it" src="img/B19358_01_02.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.2 – Select your computer’s platform if the download page was not able to detect it</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">The download page should<a id="_idIndexMarker010"/> also detect whether you’re using a 64- or 32-bit system. If it did not do this correctly, then you can find the other versions under the <strong class="bold">All </strong><strong class="bold">downloads</strong> section:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.3 – The All Downloads section, where you can find different versions of the engine" src="img/B19358_01_04.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.3 – The All Downloads section, where you can find different versions of the engine</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">What we downloaded<a id="_idIndexMarker011"/> is a ZIP file. So, unzip it to get to the actual engine.<ul><li>On Windows: Right-click the zip file and select <strong class="bold">Extract All...</strong>. Now follow the prompt that pops up to choose a location.</li><li>On macOS: Double-click the zip file, the file will be unzipped into a new folder.</li><li>On Linux: Run the following command in the te<a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>rminal:<pre class="source-code">
unzip Godot_v4.2.1-stable_linux.x86_64.zip -d Godot</pre></li></ul></li>				<li>Put the extracted files somewhere on your computer where it will be safe, such as the desktop, applications, or any other location besides the <code>Downloads</code> folder. Otherwise, if you are anything like me, you might accidentally remove it in a clean-up spree of the <code>Downloads</code> folder.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For this book, we will be using version 4.0.0, as it just came out. But any version with a 4 at the beginning should work fine. Unfortunately, this is not a guarantee. We’ll do our best to keep this book’s content up to date, but open-source software can move quickly.</p>
			<p>The download size of Godot Engine is tiny, about 30 to 100 MB, depending on your platform. This small package is all we need to create awesome games. Compare this to Unity’s 10 GB and Unreal Engine’s whopping 34 GB! Of course, these all come without any assets, such as visuals<a id="_idIndexMarker012"/> or audio.</p>
			<p>That’s it for getting the engine. You don’t need to install anything else to use it.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Other versions of the engine</p>
			<p class="callout">Because Godot Engine is open-source, there are also a lot of complete game projects that are open-source too. If you ever want to run one of those game projects on your machine, make sure you use the correct version of Godot; otherwise, the game could crash and weird things might happen. You can find and download<a id="_idIndexMarker013"/> all official versions of Godot from <a href="https://godotengine.org/download/">https://godotengine.org/download/</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>Creating a new project</h2>
			<p>Now, let’s go ahead and create<a id="_idIndexMarker014"/> our first Godot Engine project, hopefully with many others to come in the future!</p>
			<ol>
				<li>First, open the engine by double-clicking the file we downloaded in the <em class="italic">Downloading the engine</em> section. A screen like this will greet you:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.4 – Creating a new project by pressing the New button" src="img/B19358_01_05.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.4 – Creating a new project by pressing the New button</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Choose <strong class="bold">+ New</strong>; a new window<a id="_idIndexMarker015"/> will pop up:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.5 – Setting up the new project" src="img/B19358_01_06.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.5 – Setting up the new project</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Call the project <code>Hello World</code>.</li>
				<li>Select a <strong class="bold">Project Path</strong> area to put the project. Create a new folder by using the <strong class="bold">Create Folder</strong> button or use an existing one but note that this folder should preferably be empty. Although the folder you select can contain files already, starting from a clean directory will keep everything we do more organized.</li>
				<li>Select <strong class="bold">Compatibility</strong> under the <strong class="bold">Renderer</strong> category. The compatibility<a id="_idIndexMarker016"/> renderer is made to make sure that our game can run on a wide variety of hardware and supports older graphics cards and web exports. The Forward+ renderer is used for cutting-edge graphics but demands a better graphics card, while the mobile renderer is optimized for mobile devices. For what we are doing, the compatibility renderer is more than capable enough and it makes sure that we can export to the biggest amount of platforms possible.</li>
				<li>Finally, press <strong class="bold">Create &amp; </strong><strong class="bold">Edit</strong>!</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Godot will now set up the basic structure of our project within the selected folder and, after a few seconds, show us the editor:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.6 – The Godot Engine 4.0 editor" src="img/B19358_01_07.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.6 – The Godot Engine 4.0 editor</p>
			<p>At first sight, this may look quite daunting – little windows everywhere, multiple controls here and there, and a giant 3D space<a id="_idIndexMarker017"/> in the middle. Don’t worry. By the end of this book, you’ll know the ins and outs of almost everything that lies before you. You’re in good hands.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Fun fact</p>
			<p class="callout">The Godot developers used Godot Engine to create the editor itself. Try to wrap your brain around that! They did this to easily extend and maintain the editor.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>Light mode</h2>
			<p>Because of the limitations<a id="_idIndexMarker018"/> of printed media, dark screenshots might look grainy and unsharp. That is why, from this point on, we’ll switch to the light version of Godot. There is no difference but the appearance of the editor.</p>
			<p>If you also want to follow along in light mode, perform these optional steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to <strong class="bold">Editor</strong> | <strong class="bold">Editor Settings…</strong> at the top of the screen:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.7 – The Editor Settings… option in the Editor menu" src="img/B19358_01_08.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.7 – The Editor Settings… option in the Editor menu</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Find the <strong class="bold">Theme</strong> settings.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Light</strong> theme<a id="_idIndexMarker019"/> within the <strong class="bold">Preset</strong> dropdown:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.8 – Selecting the Light theme preset in the Theme settings" src="img/B19358_01_09.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.8 – Selecting the Light theme preset in the Theme settings</p>
			<p>Now, the editor will look like what’s shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.9</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.9 – The Godot Engine editor with the Light theme applied" src="img/B19358_01_10.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.9 – The Godot Engine editor with the Light theme applied</p>
			<p>With that out of the way, let’s get back<a id="_idIndexMarker020"/> to creating a game by learning how to creat<a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>e a scene.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Creating the main scene</h2>
			<p>Let’s continue by setting<a id="_idIndexMarker021"/> up our first scene:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the leftmost panel of <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.10</em>, which shows the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> panel, select <strong class="bold">2D Scene</strong>. This button will set up the scene for a 2D game, as shown here:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.10 – Selecting 2D Scene in the left panel" src="img/B19358_01_11.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.10 – Selecting 2D Scene in the left panel</p>
			<p class="list-inset">You’ll see that there is one node in the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> panel called <strong class="bold">Node2D</strong> and that the 3D space in the middle<a id="_idIndexMarker022"/> window got replaced with a 2D plane.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Right-click the node called <code>Main</code>. This node will be our main node to work with for now:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.11 – Renaming the Node2D node to Main" src="img/B19358_01_12.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.11 – Renaming the Node2D node to Main</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Save the scene by going to <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> | <strong class="bold">Save Scene</strong> or by pressing <em class="italic">Ctrl</em>/<em class="italic">Cmd</em> + <em class="italic">S</em>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.12 – Saving the scene" src="img/B19358_01_13.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.12 – Saving the scene</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">We’ll be asked where<a id="_idIndexMarker023"/> we wish to save the scene. Choose the project’s root folder and name the file <code>main.tscn</code>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.13 – Selecting the root folder to save the scene and naming it main.tscn" src="img/B19358_01_14.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.13 – Selecting the root folder to save the scene and naming it main.tscn</p>
			<p>That’s all for creating our first scene. What we just added is a node. These nodes represent everything in Godot. Images, sounds, menus, special effects – everything is a node. You can think of them as game objects, each having a separate function in the game. The player could be a node, just like enemies or coins.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, scenes are collections of nodes or collections of game objects. For now, you can think of scenes as levels. For a level, you need a player node, some enemy nodes, and a bunch of coin nodes; the collection<a id="_idIndexMarker024"/> of these is a scene. It’s like nodes are the paint and scenes are our canvases.</p>
			<p>We’ll come back to nodes and scenes throughout t<a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>his book.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>A brief UI overview</h2>
			<p>Now would be a great time to review <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>some of the more prominent features of the editor’s UI. As we saw earlier, it looks something like this:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.14 – An overview of the editor" src="img/B19358_01_15.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.14 – An overview of the editor</p>
			<p>The prominent elements of the editor<a id="_idIndexMarker026"/> are as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Scene Tree</strong> area shows all the nodes in the current scene. For now, there is only one.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">FileSystem</strong> area provides access to the files within the project folder.</li>
				<li>The middle window is the <strong class="bold">currently active main editor</strong>. For now, we can see the 2D editor, which will allow us to place nodes in 2D space within the scene.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> area can be found entirely to the right and shows the properties for the currently selected node. If you open some accordion menus, such as the <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> section, you will find multiple settings associated with the selected node.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Nodes by themselves don’t do much. They provide us with specific functionalities, such as showing an image, playing a sound, and more, but they still need some higher logic to bind them into the actual game. That’s why<a id="_idIndexMarker027"/> we can extend their functionality and behavior w<a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>ith scripts.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Writing our first script</h2>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">script</strong> is a piece of code<a id="_idIndexMarker028"/> that adds logic to a node, such as moving an image or deciding when to play that sound.</p>
			<p>We’ll create our first script now. Right-click the <code>Main</code> node again and choose <strong class="bold">Attach Script</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.15 – Attaching a script to the Main node" src="img/B19358_01_16.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.15 – Attaching a script to the Main node</p>
			<p>A pop-up window will appear. Keep everything as-is. The important thing to note is that the selected language is <strong class="bold">GDScript</strong>, the programming language we’ll learn throughout this book. The rest is not very important for now. It even pre-filled the script’s name after the node’s name, which will attach this script. Press <strong class="bold">Create</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.16 – Pressing Create to create the script" src="img/B19358_01_17.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.16 – Pressing Create to create the script</p>
			<p>The middle panel, where the 2D plane<a id="_idIndexMarker029"/> used to be, is replaced with a new window:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.17 – A fresh script" src="img/B19358_01_18.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.17 – A fresh script</p>
			<p>This is the <strong class="bold">Script</strong> editor. We will spend most of our time here learning how to program during the first part of this book.</p>
			<p>As you may have noticed, the middle window is context-dependent. It can be a <strong class="bold">2D</strong>, <strong class="bold">3D</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Script</strong> editor:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.18 – The different main windows" src="img/B19358_01_19.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.18 – The different main windows</p>
			<p>To switch between these different editors, use the buttons at the top of the screen.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">AssetLib</p>
			<p class="callout">The last tab, <strong class="bold">AssetLib</strong>, is useful for getting pre-made assets from the Asset Library of Godot. This library can provide custom nodes, scripts, or any other assets for your project directly from within Godot Editor. We won’t cover the 3D editor or AssetLib, but it is good to know they are there.</p>
			<p class="callout">All of the assets on <strong class="bold">AssetLib</strong> are open-source and thus completely free to use! Hurray for FOSS!</p>
			<p>If you have tried to change<a id="_idIndexMarker030"/> to the different editors, return to the <strong class="bold">Script</strong> editor so that we can create our first script and ensure everything is ready. The code within the script looks like this for the moment:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
extends Node2D
# Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
func _ready():
   pass # Replace with function body.
# Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame.
func _process(delta):
   pass</pre>			<p>Again, don’t worry about all the different commands and specific syntax here. We will cover everything in due time. For now, it’s enough to know that this is a script written in GDScript, the scripting language of Godot.</p>
			<p>To create the classic <code>pass # Replace with function body.</code> to the following:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
   print("Hello, World")</pre>			<p>This line of code will show the text <code>"Hello, World;"</code> it will not use a printer to print out anything. We can also throw <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>away a bunch of the code we<a id="_idTextAnchor035"/><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/> don’t need. The whole script should now look like this:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
extends Node2D
func _ready():
<code>print</code> statement we added. We add this <em class="italic">tab</em> because it shows that the line of code belongs to the <code>_ready</code> function. We call the practice of adding <em class="italic">tabs</em> in front of lines <strong class="bold">indentation</strong>.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Throughout this book, we haven’t used tabs in the text due to editorial reasons. We will use three spaces to represent one tab. This is why you’re better off not copying and pasting code from this book into the editor. The complete code for this book can be accessed and copied from this book’s GitHub repository (link in the <em class="italic">Technical </em><em class="italic">requirements</em> section).</p>
			<p>All the lines within the <code>_ready</code> function will run when the node is ready, we’ll see what this means in more detail later. For now, it suffices to know that this function gets executed when the node is ready to be used.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.19 – A function contains a code block" src="img/B19358_01_20.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.19 – A function contains a code block</p>
			<p>Functions are small groups of code<a id="_idIndexMarker032"/> a computer can execute. A function is always introduced by the <code>func</code> keyword, followed by the name of the function.</p>
			<p>You can see that the pre-filled script also provided us with a <code>_process</code> function, which we will not use for now, so we deleted it. We’ll return to functions in <a href="B19358_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor164"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>. Remember that every line of code within the <code>_ready</code> function will execute from the moment our game runs and that a <em class="italic">tab</em> must precede these lines.</p>
			<p>Use the <em class="italic">Tab</em> key to insert these tabs. The symbol on your keyboard looks like this: ↹</p>
			<p>The last line of interest in the script says <code>extends Node2D</code>. This simply says that we are using <strong class="bold">Node2D</strong>, the type of node we added to the scene, as a base for the script to start from. Everything in the script is an extension of the functionality that <strong class="bold">Node2D</strong> completes. We’ll learn more about extending scripts and classes in <a href="B19358_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor164"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>.</p>
			<p>Now, press the play button in the top right to run our project:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.20 – The play button is used to run the project" src="img/B19358_01_21.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.20 – The play button is used to run the project</p>
			<p>A popup will ask us which scene we want to use as the main scene. Choose <strong class="bold">Select Current</strong> to set the current scene as the main one:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.21 – Godot Editor will ask us to define a main scene. We can just select the current one" src="img/B19358_01_22.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.21 – Godot Editor will ask us to define a main scene. We can just select the current one</p>
			<p>An empty, gray screen will pop up. We did not add<a id="_idIndexMarker033"/> anything visually to our game yet. Later, there will be a sprawling and exciting game here. But this gray screen is what we should expect for now:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.22 – An empty game window" src="img/B19358_01_23.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.22 – An empty game window</p>
			<p>The actual exciting part is happening in the editor window itself. You’ll see a new little window unfolding from the bottom where the text <strong class="bold">Hello, World</strong> is printed out:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.23 – The output of the game shows Hello, World" src="img/B19358_01_24.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.23 – The output of the game shows Hello, World</p>
			<p>Success! We wrote our first script!</p>
			<p>As an experiment, try changing<a id="_idIndexMarker034"/> the text within the double quotes of <em class="italic">step 4</em> and rerun the program. You should see the new text printed in the output window:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.24 – The output of the game after changing the printed text" src="img/B19358_01_25.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.24 – The output of the game after changing the printed text</p>
			<p>Those were our first steps in creating a scene and script within the Godot game engine. Throughout this book, we’ll learn everything we need to know to create a whole game from scratch, but we’ll leave it here for now. Next, we’ll take a quick look at joining the game development<a id="_idIndexMarker035"/><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/> community.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>The Godot Engine Documentation</h1>
			<p>If you ever feel<a id="_idIndexMarker036"/> lost, there is also the official <strong class="bold">Godot Engine Documentation</strong>. This is a very exhaustive source of information on all the different classes and nodes and contains manuals on all the different subsystems related to the engine.</p>
			<p>You can access<a id="_idIndexMarker037"/> the documentation here: <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/">https://docs.godotengine.org/</a>.</p>
			<p>Whenever you are searching how to use a certain part of the engine or something in the book is not 100% clear, you could consult the documentation.</p>

			<p>In the last part of this book, I’ll go into more detail about the community and how you can join and maybe even help. But for now, let’s focus on learning the tra<a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>de ourselves!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we learned about Godot Engine, which is a FOSS. Then, we downloaded the engine for ourselves and created our first project. Lastly, we saw that the built-in programming language is GDScript and made our first <code>"Hello, </code><code>World"</code> script.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we’ll start our journey of learning how to program. S<a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>ee you there!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Quiz time</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>What does the acronym FOSS mean and where is it used?</li>
				<li>Is the Godot engine an open-source project?</li>
				<li>What line of code did we add to show <em class="italic">“Hello, World”</em> in the Output? Why did we add a <em class="italic">tab</em> at the beginning of this line?</li>
				<li>What are <em class="italic">nodes</em> in Godot Engine and how do they relate to <em class="italic">scenes</em>?</li>
