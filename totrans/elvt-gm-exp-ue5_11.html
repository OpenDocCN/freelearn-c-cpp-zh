<h1 id="_idParaDest-195"><a id="_idTextAnchor223"/>Working with Blend Space 1D, Key Bindings, and State Machines</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter, we had a high-level look at animation and developing the game design for our <code>SuperSideScroller</code> project. You were provided with just the beginning steps in terms of developing the project itself. Then, you prepared the player character’s Animation Blueprint and character Blueprint, and also imported all of the required skeletal and animation assets. </p>
<p>In this chapter, we will set up the walking and jumping animations of our player character so that the movement has a sense of locomotion. To accomplish this, you will be introduced to <strong class="bold">Blend Spaces</strong>, <strong class="bold">Animation Blueprints</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Animation State Machines</strong>, the three pillars behind how character animations are controlled.</p>
<p>At this point, the character can move around the level, but is stuck in the T-Pose and does not animate at all. This can be fixed by creating a new Blend Space for the player character, which will be done in the very first exercise of this chapter. Once the Blend Space is complete, you will use it to implement the character Animation Blueprint for the character to animate while moving.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following main topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating Blend Spaces</li>
<li>Main character Animation Blueprint</li>
<li>What are velocity vectors?</li>
<li>Enhanced input system</li>
<li>Using Animation State Machines</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of the chapter, the player character will be able to walk, sprint, and jump, thus providing a better game feel to how the character will move in our game. By creating and learning about Blend Space 1D and Animation Blueprint assets, you will add a layer of sophistication to how the player movement is handled, while also establishing the groundwork for further animations, such as the projectile throw.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-196"><a id="_idTextAnchor224"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p>For this chapter, you will need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unreal Engine 5 installed</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2019 installed</li>
</ul>
<p>The project for this chapter can be found in the <code>Chapter11</code> folder of the code bundle for this book, which can be downloaded here: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Elevating-Game-Experiences-with-Unreal-Engine-5-Second-Edition">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Elevating-Game-Experiences-with-Unreal-Engine-5-Second-Edition</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll start this chapter by learning about Blend Spaces before creating the Blend Space asset that you will need to animate the player character.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-197"><a id="_idTextAnchor225"/>Creating Blend Spaces</h1>
<p>Blend Spaces <a id="_idIndexMarker846"/>allow you to blend between multiple animations based on one or more conditions. Blend Spaces are used in different types of video games, but, more often than not, in games where the player can view the entire character. Blend Spaces are not usually used when the player can only see the character’s arms, such as in the <strong class="bold">First-Person</strong> project template provided in UE5, as shown here:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 11.1 – The first-person perspective of the default character in the First-Person project template in UE5 " height="668" src="img/Figure_11.01_B18531.jpg" width="1650"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.1 – The first-person perspective of the default character in the First-Person project template in UE5</p>
<p>It is more common in third-person games where there is a need to use Blend Spaces to smoothly blend movement-based animations of the character. A good example is the <strong class="bold">Third-Person</strong> template <a id="_idIndexMarker847"/>project provided in UE5, as shown here:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 11.2 – The third-person perspective of the default character in the First-Person project template in UE5 " height="768" src="img/Figure_11.02_B18531.jpg" width="1494"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.2 – The third-person perspective of the default character in the First-Person project template in UE5</p>
<p>Let’s look at the Blend Space asset provided by Unreal Engine when creating the <code>Third Person template</code> project template by opening <code>/Characters/Mannequins/Animations/Quinn/BS_MF_Unarmed_WalkRun</code>. This is a Blend Space 1D asset created for the <code>Side Scroller</code> mannequin skeletal mesh so that the player character can smoothly blend between <code>Idle</code>, <code>Walking</code>, and <code>Running</code> animations based on the speed of the character.</p>
<p>If you check <code>Horizontal Axis</code> parameter, where we have settings for this axis, which essentially acts as a variable that we can reference in our Animation Blueprint. Please refer to the following screenshot to see the <strong class="bold">AXIS SETTINGS</strong> category <a id="_idIndexMarker848"/>within <strong class="bold">Persona</strong>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 11.3 – The axis settings for the Blend Space 1D " height="486" src="img/Figure_11.03_B18531.jpg" width="1450"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.3 – The axis settings for the Blend Space 1D</p>
<p>Below the preview window, we will also see a small graph with points along the line from left to right; one of these points will be highlighted <code>green</code>, while the others will be <code>white</code>. We can hold <em class="italic">Shift</em> and drag this <code>green</code> point along the horizontal axis to preview the blended animation based on its value. At speed <code>0</code>, our character is in an <code>Idle</code> state. As we move our preview along the axis, the animation will begin to blend into <code>Walking</code>, followed <a id="_idIndexMarker849"/>by <code>Running</code>. The following screenshot shows the single-axis graph:</p>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.4 – The key frame timeline of the 1D Blend Space 1D</p>
<p>In the next section, we will look at Blend Space 1Ds versus a normal Blend Space, and when to use them based on your animation needs.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-198"><a id="_idTextAnchor226"/>Blend Space 1D versus normal Blend Space</h2>
<p>Before<a id="_idIndexMarker850"/> moving forward with the Blend Space 1D, let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker851"/>take a moment to look at the main differences between a Blend Space 1D and a normal Blend Space in UE5: </p>
<ul>
<li>The Blend Space in Unreal Engine is controlled by two variables, represented by the X and <em class="italic">Y</em> axes of the Blend Space graph.</li>
<li>On the other hand, the Blend Space 1D only supports one axis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try to imagine this as a 2D graph. Since you know that each axis has a direction, you can visualize why and when you would need to use this Blend Space rather than a Blend Space 1D, which only supports a single axis.</p>
<p>Say, for example, you wanted to make the player character strafe left and right while also supporting forward and backward movement. If you were to map this movement out on a graph, it would look as follows:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 11.5 – What a Blend Space movement would look like on a simple graph " height="657" src="img/Figure_11.05_B18531.jpg" width="1168"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.5 – What a Blend Space movement would look like on a simple graph</p>
<p>Now, visualize the movement of the player character, keeping in mind the fact that the game is a <code>Side Scroller</code>. The character won’t be supporting left or right strafing or forward and backward movement. The player character will only need to animate in one direction because the <code>Side Scroller</code> character rotates toward the direction of movement by default. Having to only support one direction is why you are using a Blend Space 1D instead of a normal Blend Space.</p>
<p>We will need to set up this type of Blend Space asset for our main character and use the Blend <a id="_idIndexMarker852"/>Space <a id="_idIndexMarker853"/>for the same purpose, for movement-based animation blending. In the next exercise, we’ll create the Blend Space asset using our custom animation assets.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-199"><a id="_idTextAnchor227"/>Exercise 11.01 – creating the CharacterMovement Blend Space 1D</h2>
<p>To get the player <a id="_idIndexMarker854"/>character to animate while they move, you need to create a Blend Space.</p>
<p>In this exercise, you will create the <code>CharacterMovement</code> component so that you assign an appropriate walking speed value that corresponds with the Blend Space.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to complete this exercise:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <code>/MainCharacter/Animation</code> folder in the <strong class="bold">Content Drawer</strong> window, where all the new animations you imported in the previous chapter are located. </li>
<li>Now, <em class="italic">right-click</em> in the main area of the <strong class="bold">Content Drawer</strong> window and, from the drop-down menu, hover over the <strong class="bold">Animation</strong> option. From its additional drop-down menu, select <strong class="bold">Blend Space 1D</strong>. </li>
<li>Make sure to select <code>MainCharacter_Skeleton</code>, not <code>UE4_Mannequin_Skeleton</code>, as the skeleton for the Blend Space. </li>
</ol>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">If you apply the incorrect skeleton, the Blend Space will not be functional for the player character, nor will the custom skeletal mesh when you select the skeleton assets, such as Blend Spaces or Animation Blueprints, that are required. Here, you are telling this asset which skeleton it is compatible with. By doing so, in the case of a Blend Space, you can use animations that have been made for this skeleton, thereby ensuring that everything is compatible with everything else.</p>
<ol>
<li value="4">Name this Blend Space asset <code>SideScroller_IdleRun_1D</code>.</li>
<li>Next, open the <code>SideScroller_IdleRun_</code>Blend Space 1D asset. You can see the single-axis graph below the preview window:</li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 11.6 – The editing tool used to create Blend Spaces in UE5 " height="891" src="img/Figure_11.06_B18531.jpg" width="1650"/>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.6 – The editing tool used to create Blend Spaces in UE5</p>
<p>On the left-hand<a id="_idIndexMarker855"/> side of the editor, you have the <code>Animation Blueprint</code> property for the player character. The following screenshot shows the default values that have been set for <code>Horizontal Axis</code>:</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.8 – The horizontal axis is now named Speed</p>
<ol>
<li value="7">The next step is to establish <code>0.0f</code>, which is set by default, because the player character will be in an <code>Idle</code> state when they are not moving at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>But what about <strong class="bold">Maximum Axis Value</strong>? This one is a little trickier because you need to bear the following points in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will be supporting a sprinting behavior for the character that allows the player to move faster when holding down the <em class="italic">Left Shift</em> keyboard button. When released, the player will return to the default walking speed.</li>
<li>The <a id="_idIndexMarker857"/>walking speed must match the characters’ <code>Max Walk Speed</code> parameter of <code>CharacterMovementComponent</code>.</li>
<li>Before you set <code>SuperSideScroller</code> game. </li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li value="8">For this, navigate to <code>/Game/MainCharacter/Blueprints/</code> and open the <code>BP_SuperSideScroller_MainCharacter</code> Blueprint.</li>
<li>Select the <code>Character Movement</code> component and, in the <code>Max Walk Speed</code> parameter and set its value to <code>300.0f</code>. </li>
</ol>
<p>With the <code>Max Walk Speed</code> parameter set, return to the <code>SideScroller_IdleRun_</code>Blend Space 1D and set the <code>Maximum Axis Value</code> parameter. If the walking speed was <code>300.0f</code>, what should the maximum value be? Keeping in mind that you will support sprinting for the player character, this maximum value needs to be more than the walking speed.</p>
<ol>
<li value="10">Update the <code>Maximum Axis Value</code> parameter so that its value is <code>500.0f</code>. </li>
<li>Lastly, set the <code>Number of Grid Divisions</code> parameter to a value of <code>5</code>. The reason for this is that when working with divisions, a <code>100</code> unit spacing between each grid point makes it easier to work with since <code>Maximum Axis Value</code> is <code>500.0f</code>. This is useful in the case of grid point snapping when you apply the movement animations along the grid. </li>
<li>Leave the remaining properties set as their defaults:</li>
</ol>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.9 – The final axis settings for the Blend Space</p>
<p>With these<a id="_idIndexMarker858"/> settings, you are telling the Blend Space to use an incoming float value between <code>0.0f</code> and <code>500.0f</code> to blend between the animations that you will place in the next step and the activity. By dividing the grid into <code>5</code> divisions, you can easily add the animations needed at the correct float value along the axis graph.</p>
<p>Let’s continue creating the Blend Space by adding our first animation to the axis graph: the <code>Idle</code> animation.</p>
<ol>
<li value="13">To the right of the grid, there is the <code>MainCharacter_Skeleton</code> asset when creating the Blend Space.</li>
<li>Next, left-click and drag the <code>Idle</code> animation to our grid at position <code>0.0</code>:</li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 11.10 – Dragging the Idle animation to our grid at position 0.0 " height="329" src="img/Figure_11.10_B18531.jpg" width="1239"/>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.10 – Dragging the Idle animation to our grid at position 0.0</p>
<p>Notice<a id="_idIndexMarker859"/> that when dragging this animation to the grid, it will snap to the grid point. Once the animation has been added to the Blend Space, the player character will change from its default T-Pose and start to play the <code>Idle</code> animation:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 11.11 – With the Idle animation added to the Blend Space 1D, the player character begins to animate " height="865" src="img/Figure_11.11_B18531.jpg" width="1128"/>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.11 – With the Idle animation added to the Blend Space 1D, the player character begins to animate</p>
<p>With this exercise<a id="_idIndexMarker860"/> complete, you now have an understanding of how to create a Blend Space 1D and, more importantly, you know the differences between a Blend Space 1D and a normal Blend Space. Additionally, you know the importance of aligning the values between the player character movement component and the Blend Space and why you need to ensure that the walking speed correlates appropriately with the values in the Blend Space.</p>
<p>Now, let’s move on to the first activity of this chapter, where you will be applying the remaining <code>Walking</code> and <code>Running</code> animations to the Blend Space, just as you added the <code>Idle</code> animation.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-200"><a id="_idTextAnchor228"/>Activity 11.01 – adding the Walking and Running animations to the Blend Space</h2>
<p>The 1D movement Blend <a id="_idIndexMarker861"/>Space is coming<a id="_idIndexMarker862"/> together nicely so far, but you are missing the <code>Walking</code> and <code>Running</code> animations. In this activity, you will finish the Blend Space by adding these animations to the Blend Space at the appropriate horizontal axis values that make sense for the main character.</p>
<p>Using the knowledge you acquired from <em class="italic">Exercise 11.01 – creating the CharacterMovement Blend Space 1D</em>, follow these steps to finish up the character movement Blend Space:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Continuing from <em class="italic">Exercise 11.01 – creating the CharacterMovement Blend Space 1D</em>, head back to the <strong class="bold">Asset Browser</strong> window.</li>
<li>Now, add the <code>Walking</code> animation to the horizontal grid position <code>300.0f</code>.</li>
<li>Finally, add the <code>Running</code> animation to the horizontal grid position <code>500.0f</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">Remember that you can hold <em class="italic">shift</em> and drag the green preview grid point along the grid axis to see how the animation blends together based on the axis value, so pay attention to the character animation preview window to make sure that it looks correct.</p>
<p>The expected output is as follows:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 11.12 – The Running animation in the Blend Space " height="504" src="img/Figure_11.12_B18531.jpg" width="1650"/>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.12 – The Running animation in the Blend Space</p>
<p>At this point, you should have a functional Blend Space that blends the character movement animations from <code>Idle</code> to <code>Walking</code> to <code>Running</code> based on the value of the horizontal axis<a id="_idIndexMarker863"/> that <a id="_idIndexMarker864"/>represents the player character’s speed.</p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-201"><a id="_idTextAnchor229"/>The Main Character Animation Blueprint</h1>
<p>With the<a id="_idIndexMarker865"/> animations added to the Blend Space, you should be able to walk around and see those animations at work, right? Well, no. If you select <strong class="bold">Play-In-Editor</strong>, you will notice that the main character is still moving in the T-Pose. The reason is that you aren’t telling the Animation Blueprint to use our Blend Space asset yet, which you will do later in this chapter. </p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-202"><a id="_idTextAnchor230"/>Animation Blueprints</h2>
<p>Before jumping into<a id="_idIndexMarker866"/> using the Animation Blueprint you created in the previous chapter, let’s briefly discuss what this type of Blueprint is, and what its main function is. An Animation Blueprint is a type of Blueprint that allows you to control the animation of a skeleton and skeletal mesh – in this instance, the player character skeleton and mesh you imported in the previous chapter.</p>
<p>An Animation Blueprint is broken <a id="_idIndexMarker867"/>into two main graphs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Event Graph</li>
<li>Anim Graph</li>
</ul>
<p>The Event Graph works as in a normal Blueprint where you can use events, functions, and variables to script gameplay logic. The Anim Graph, on the other hand, is unique to an Animation Blueprint, and this is where you use logic to determine the final pose of the skeleton and skeletal mesh at any given frame. It is here where you can use elements such as State Machines, anim slots, Blend Spaces, and other animation-related nodes to then output the final animation for the character.</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p>Open the <code>AnimBP_SuperSideScroller_MainCharacter</code> Animation Blueprint in the <code>MainCharacter/Blueprints</code> directory.</p>
<p>By default, <strong class="bold">AnimGraph</strong> should open, where you will see the character preview, the <strong class="bold">Asset Browser</strong> window, and the main graph. It is inside this <strong class="bold">AnimGraph</strong> that you will implement the Blend Space you just created to have the player character animate correctly when moving around the level. </p>
<p>Let’s get started with the next exercise, where we will do this and learn more about Animation Blueprints.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-203"><a id="_idTextAnchor231"/>Exercise 11.02 – adding the Blend Space to the character Animation Blueprint</h2>
<p>For this <a id="_idIndexMarker868"/>exercise, you will add the <a id="_idIndexMarker869"/>Blend Space to the Animation Blueprint and prepare the necessary variable to help control this Blend Space based on the movement speed of the player character. Let’s begin by adding the Blend Space to <strong class="bold">AnimGraph</strong>.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to complete this exercise:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Add the Blend Space to <code>SideScroller_IdleRun_</code>Blend Space 1D asset into <strong class="bold">AnimGraph</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that the variable input for this Blend Space node is labeled <code>Speed</code>, just like the horizontal axis inside the Blend Space. Please refer to <em class="italic">Figure 11.14</em> to see<a id="_idIndexMarker870"/> the<a id="_idIndexMarker871"/> Blend Space in the <strong class="bold">Asset Browser</strong> window:</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">If you were to name <strong class="bold">Horizontal Axis</strong> differently, the new name would be shown as the input parameter of the Blend Space.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 11.13 – Asset Browser gives you access to all animation assets related to MainCharacter_Skeleton " height="391" src="img/Figure_11.13_B18531.jpg" width="890"/>

<p>Now, we<a id="_idIndexMarker876"/> can <a id="_idIndexMarker877"/>control our Blend Space with our <code>Speed</code> input variable. With the ability to use the Blend Space in place, you need a way to store the character’s movement speed and pass that value to the <code>Speed</code> input parameter of the Blend Space. Let’s learn how to do this.</p>
<ol>
<li value="4">Navigate to the <code>Event Graph</code> property of our Animation Blueprint. By default, there will be the <code>Event Blueprint Update Animation</code> event and a pure <code>Try Get Pawn Owner</code> function.

<p class="callout">The main <a id="_idIndexMarker878"/>difference <a id="_idIndexMarker879"/>between a <code>Pure</code> and <code>Impure</code> function in UE5 is that a <code>Pure</code> function implies that the logic it contains will not modify a variable or member of the class that it is being used in. In the case of <code>Try</code> <code>Get</code> <code>Pawn</code> <code>Owner</code>, it is simply returning a reference to the <code>Pawn</code> owner of the Animation Blueprint. <code>Impure</code> functions do not have this implication and are free to modify any variable or member it wants.</p>

<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker886"/>exercise, you<a id="_idIndexMarker887"/> obtained the player character speed by using the <code>GetVelocity</code> function. The vector that was returned from the <code>GetVelocity</code> function gives the length of the vector to ascertain the actual speed. By storing this value in the <code>Speed</code> variable, you can now reference this value in the <strong class="bold">AnimGraph</strong> property of the Animation Blueprint to update your Blend Space, which you will do in the next exercise. But first, let’s briefly discuss velocity vectors and how we use vector mathematics to determine the speed of our player character.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-204"><a id="_idTextAnchor232"/>What are velocity vectors?</h1>
<p>Before moving on <a id="_idIndexMarker888"/>to the next step, let’s explain what you are doing when you get the velocity of the character and promote the vector length of that vector to the <code>Speed</code> variable.</p>
<p>What is velocity? Velocity is a vector that has a given <strong class="bold">magnitude</strong> and <strong class="bold">direction</strong>. To think about it another way, a vector can be drawn like an <em class="italic">arrow</em>. </p>
<p>The l<em class="italic">ength of the arrow</em> represents the <code>GetVelocity</code> function and the <code>VectorLength</code> function on the returned velocity vector; you are getting the value of the <code>Speed</code> variable of your character. That is why you store that value in a variable and use it to control the Blend Space, as shown in the following diagram. Here, you can see an example of vectors. One has a positive (right) direction with a magnitude of <code>100</code>, while the other has a negative (left) direction with a magnitude of <code>35</code>:</p>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.23 – Two different vectors</p>
<p>In the following exercise, you will use the <code>Speed</code> variable you created from the <code>VectorLength</code> function of the velocity parameter of the player character from the previous exercise to drive how the Blend Space 1D will animate the character.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-205"><a id="_idTextAnchor233"/>Exercise 11.03 – passing the character’s Speed variable into the Blend Space</h2>
<p>Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker889"/>you have a better understanding <a id="_idIndexMarker890"/>of vectors and how to store the <code>Speed</code> variable of the player character from the previous exercise, let’s apply the speed to the Blend Space 1D you created earlier in this chapter.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to complete this exercise:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Navigate to the <code>AnimBP_SuperSideScroller_MainCharacter</code> Animation Blueprint.</li>
<li>Use the <code>Speed</code> variable to update the Blend Space in real time in <code>Speed</code> variable onto the graph, and connecting the variable to the input of the <code>Blendspace Player</code> function:<div><img alt="Figure 11.24 – Using the Speed variable to update the Blend Space on every frame " height="350" src="img/Figure_11.24_B18531.jpg" width="1418"/></div></li>

<ol>
<li value="3">Next, compile <a id="_idIndexMarker891"/>the Animation<a id="_idIndexMarker892"/> Blueprint.</li>
</ol>
<p>With that, you can update the Blend Space based on the speed of the player character. When you use PIE, you will see the character in the <code>Idle</code> state and the <code>Walking</code> state when you move:</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.25 – The player character is finally able to walk around in the level</p>
<p>Finally, the main character is using the movement animations based on movement speed. In the<a id="_idIndexMarker893"/> next <a id="_idIndexMarker894"/>activity, you will update the character movement component so that you can preview the character’s <code>Running</code> animation from the Blend Space.</p>

<p>With the <a id="_idIndexMarker895"/>Animation Blueprint updating and getting the speed of the player character, you can preview the <code>Idle</code> and <code>Walking</code> animations in-game.</p>
<p>In this activity, you will update the <code>CharacterMovement</code> component of the player character Blueprint so that you can preview the <code>Running</code> animation in-game as well.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to complete this activity:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Navigate to, and open, the <code>BP_SuperSideScroller_MainCharacter</code> player character Blueprint.</li>
<li>Access the <code>CharacterMovement</code> component.</li>
<li>Modify the <code>Max Walk Speed</code> parameter to a value of <code>500.0</code> so that your character can move fast enough to blend its animation from <code>Idle</code> to <code>Walking</code> and, finally, to <code>Running</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>By doing this, the player character can reach a speed that allows you to preview the <code>Running</code> animation in-game.</p>

<p>Now that you have <a id="_idIndexMarker897"/>handled the player character movement blending from <code>Idle</code> to <code>Walking</code> and finally to <code>Running</code>, let’s add the functionality that allows the player character to move even quicker by sprinting.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-207"><a id="_idTextAnchor235"/>Enhanced input system</h1>
<p>Every game requires <a id="_idIndexMarker898"/>input from the player, whether it is the keys on a keyboard such as <em class="italic">W</em>, <em class="italic">A</em>, <em class="italic">S</em>, and <em class="italic">D</em> for moving the player character, or the thumb sticks on a controller; this is what makes video games an interactive experience. We will be using the Enhanced Input System to add an input binding for the sprint action of the player character. For a refresher on how to enable and set up the Enhanced Input System plugin, please review <a href="B18531_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor099"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting Started with Player Input</em>; moving forward, the exercises in this chapter assume you have enabled the plugin.</p>
<p>UE5 allows us to map keyboard, mouse, gamepad, and other types of controls to labeled actions or axes that you can then reference in Blueprints or C++ to allow character or gameplay functionality to occur. It is important to point out that each unique action or axis mapping can have one or more key bindings, and that the same key binding can be used for multiple mappings. Input bindings are saved into an initialization file called <code>DefaultInput.ini</code> and can be found in the <code>Config</code> folder of your project directory.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">Legacy input bindings can be edited directly via the <code>DefaultInput.ini</code> file or through <strong class="bold">Project Settings</strong> in the editor itself. The latter is more easily accessible and less error-prone when editing.</p>
<p>In the next exercise, we’ll add a new input binding for the player character’s <code>Sprint</code> functionality.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-208"><a id="_idTextAnchor236"/>Exercise 11.04 – adding input for sprinting</h2>
<p>With the <a id="_idIndexMarker899"/>player character moving around the<a id="_idIndexMarker900"/> level, you will now implement a unique character class for the player character that derives from the base <code>SuperSideScrollerCharacter</code> C++ class. The reason to do this is so that you can easily differentiate between classes of the player character and the enemy later on, instead of relying solely on unique Blueprint classes. </p>
<p>While creating the unique C++ character class, you will implement the <em class="italic">sprinting</em> behavior to allow the player character to <em class="italic">walk</em> and <em class="italic">sprint</em> as desired.</p>
<p>Let’s begin by implementing the <code>Sprinting</code> mechanic by adding an <code>Input Action</code> for <code>Sprint</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Navigate to the <code>Content</code> directory, add a new folder called <code>Input</code>.</li>
<li>In the <code>Sprint</code>. It is in this directory that we will create both the <code>Input Action</code> and <code>Input Mapping Context</code> assets.</li>
<li>In the <code>Sprint</code> folder, right-click and find the <strong class="bold">Input Action</strong> option, under the <strong class="bold">Input</strong> category<a id="_idIndexMarker901"/> of the menu, as shown<a id="_idIndexMarker902"/> here:</li>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.30 – IC_SideScrollerCharacter using the IA_Sprint Input Action mapping</p>
<p>With the <code>Sprint</code> input binding in place, you need to create a new C++ class for the player character based on the <code>SuperSideScrollerCharacter</code> class.</p>
<ol>
<li value="11">Make sure that you update the <code>SuperSideScroller.Build.cs</code> file so that it <a id="_idIndexMarker905"/>includes<a id="_idIndexMarker906"/> the Enhanced Input plugin; otherwise, your code will not compile. Add the following line inside the <code>public SuperSideScroller(ReadOnlyTargetRues Target) : base(Target)</code> function:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>PrivateDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] {“EnhancedInput”});</code></p>
<ol>
<li value="12">Then, head back inside the editor, navigate to <strong class="bold">Tools</strong>, and, from the drop-down list, select the <strong class="bold">New C++ Class</strong> option.</li>
<li>The new player character class will inherit from the <code>SuperSideScrollerCharacter</code> parent class because this base class contains the majority of the functionality needed for the player character. After selecting the parent class, click <code>SuperSideScrollerCharacter</code> class:</li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 11.31 – Selecting the SuperSideScrollerCharacter parent class " height="572" src="img/Figure_11.31_B18531.jpg" width="1016"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.31 – Selecting the SuperSideScrollerCharacter parent class</p>
<ol>
<li value="14">Name this<a id="_idIndexMarker907"/> new<a id="_idIndexMarker908"/> class <code>SuperSideScroller_Player</code>. Leave the path as the default that Unreal Engine provides for you unless you need to adjust the file directory of this new class. After naming the new class and selecting the directory to save the class in, click <code>Create Class</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>After selecting <code>Create Class</code>, Unreal Engine will generate the source and header files for you, and Visual Studio will automatically open these files. You will notice that both the header file and the source file are almost empty. This is OK because you are inheriting from the <code>SuperSideScrollerCharacter</code> class and much of the logic you want is done in that class.</p>
<ol>
<li value="15">In <code>SuperSideScroller_Player</code>, you will only add the functionality you need on top of what you inherit. You can view the line where the inheritance is taking place inside <code>SuperSideScroller_Player.h</code>:<pre>class SUPERSIDESCROLLER_API ASuperSideScroller_Player : public ASuperSideScrollerCharacter</pre></li>
</ol>
<p>This class declaration is saying that the new <code>ASuperSideScroller_Player</code> class inherits from the <code>ASuperSideScrollerCharacter</code> class.</p>
<p>By completing this exercise, you added an <code>Sprint</code> mechanic that can then be referenced in C++ and used to allow the player to sprint. Now that you have also created the C++ class for the player character, you can update the code with the <code>Sprint</code> functionality, but first, you will need to update the <code>Blueprint</code> character and the Animation Blueprint to reference this new class. We’ll do this in the next exercise.</p>
<p>What happens when you reparent a Blueprint to a new class? Each Blueprint inherits from a parent class. In most cases, this is <code>Actor</code>, but in the case of your character Blueprint, its parent class is <code>SuperSideScrollerCharacter</code>. Inheriting from a parent class allows a Blueprint to inherit the functionality and variables of that class so that the logic can be reused at the Blueprint level. </p>
<p>For<a id="_idIndexMarker909"/> example, when <a id="_idIndexMarker910"/>inheriting from the <code>SuperSideScrollerCharacter</code> class, the Blueprint inherits components such as the <code>CharacterMovement</code> component and the <code>Mesh</code> skeletal mesh component, which can then be modified in the Blueprint. </p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor237"/>Exercise 11.05 – reparenting the character Blueprint</h2>
<p>Now that you have <a id="_idIndexMarker911"/>created a new character class for the player character, you need to update the <code>BP_SuperSideScroller_MainCharacter</code> Blueprint so that it uses the <code>SuperSideScroller_Player</code> class as its parent class. If you don’t, then any logic you add to the new class will not affect the character made in the Blueprint.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to reparent the Blueprint to the new character class:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Navigate to <code>/Game/MainCharacter/Blueprints/</code> and open the <code>BP_SuperSideScroller_MainCharacter</code> Blueprint.</li>
<li>Select the <strong class="bold">File</strong> option on the toolbar and, from the drop-down menu, select the <strong class="bold">Reparent Blueprint</strong> option.</li>
<li>When selecting the <code>SuperSideScroller_Player</code> and select that option from the dropdown by left-clicking.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you select the new parent class for the Blueprint, Unreal Engine will reload the Blueprint and recompile it, both of which will happen automatically. </p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">Be careful when reparenting Blueprints to new parent classes as this can lead to compile errors or settings to be erased or reverted to class defaults. Unreal Engine will display any warnings or errors that may occur after compiling the Blueprint and reparenting it to a new class. These warnings and errors usually occur if there is Blueprint logic that references variables or other class members that no longer exist in the new parent class. Even if there are no compile errors, it is best to confirm that any logic or settings you have added to your Blueprint are still present after the reparenting before moving on with your work.</p>
<p>Now that your<a id="_idIndexMarker912"/> character Blueprint has been correctly reparented to the new <code>SuperSideScroller_Player</code> class, you need to update the <code>AnimBP_SuperSideScroller_MainCharacter</code> Animation Blueprint to ensure that you are casting to the correct class when using the <code>Try Get Pawn Owner</code> function.</p>
<ol>
<li value="4">Next, navigate to the <code>/MainCharacter/Blueprints/</code> directory and open the <code>AnimBP_SuperSideScroller_MainCharacter</code> Animation Blueprint. </li>
<li>Open <code>Return Value</code> property of the <code>Try Get Pawn Owner</code> function, search for <code>Cast</code> <code>to</code> <code>SuperSideScroller_Player</code>:</li>
</ol>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.32 – Casting to the new SuperSideScroller_Player class</p>
<ol>
<li value="6">Now, you can connect the output as a <code>SuperSideScroller_Player</code> cast to the <code>MainCharacter</code> variable. This works because the <code>MainCharacter</code> variable is of the <code>SuperSideScrollerCharacter</code> type and the new <code>SuperSideScroller_Player</code> class inherits from that class:</li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 11.33 – You can still use the MainCharacter variable because SuperSideScroller_Player is based on SuperSideScrollerCharacter due to inheritance " height="416" src="img/Figure_11.33_B18531.jpg" width="1242"/>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.33 – You can still use the MainCharacter variable because SuperSideScroller_Player is based on SuperSideScrollerCharacter due to inheritance</p>
<p>Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker913"/>both the <code>BP_SuperSideScroller_MainCharacter</code> character Blueprint and the <code>AnimBP_SuperSideScroller_MainCharacter</code> Animation Blueprint are referencing your new <code>SuperSideScroller_Player</code> class, it is safe to venture into C++ and code the character’s sprint functionality.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor238"/>Exercise 11.06 – coding the character’s sprint functionality</h2>
<p>With the <a id="_idIndexMarker914"/>new <code>SuperSideScroller_Player</code> class reference correctly implemented in a Blueprint, it is time to start coding the functionality that will allow the player character to sprint. </p>
<p>Follow these steps to add the <code>Sprinting</code> mechanic to the character:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">The first thing to take care of is the constructor of the <code>SuperSideScroller_Player</code> class. Navigate back to Visual Studio and open the <code>SuperSideScroller_Player.h</code> header file.</li>
<li>You will use the <code>constructor</code> function later in this exercise to set initialized values for variables. For now, it will be an empty constructor. Make sure that the declaration is made under the <code>public</code> access modifier heading, as shown in the following code:<pre>//Constructor
ASuperSideScroller_Player();</pre></li>
<li>With the constructor declared, create the constructor function definition in the <code>SuperSideScroller_Player.cpp</code> source file:<pre>ASuperSideScroller_Player::ASuperSideScroller_Player()
{
}</pre></li>
</ol>
<p>With the constructor in place, it’s time to create the <code>SetupPlayerInputComponent</code> function so that you can use the key bindings you created earlier to call functions within the <code>SuperSideScroller_Player</code> class.</p>
<p>The <code>SetupPlayerInputComponent</code> function is a function that the character class has built-in by default, so you need to declare it as a <code>virtual</code> function with the <code>override</code> specifier. This tells Unreal Engine that you are using this function and intend to redefine its functionality in this new class. Make sure that the declaration is made under the <code>Protected</code> access modifier heading.</p>
<ol>
<li value="4">The <code>SetupPlayerInputComponent</code> function requires an object of the <code>UInputComponent</code> class to be passed into the function, like so:<pre>protected:
//Override base character class function to setup our 
//player 
  input component
virtual void SetupPlayerInputComponent(class UInputComponent* 
  PlayerInputComponent) override;</pre></li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>UInputComponent* PlayerInputComponent</code> variable is inherited from<a id="_idIndexMarker915"/> the <code>UCharacter</code> base class that our <code>ASuperSideScroller_Player()</code> class derives from, so it must be used as the input parameter of the <code>SetupPlayerInputComponent()</code> function. Using any other name will result in a compilation error.</p>
<ol>
<li value="5">Now, in the source file, create the definition of the <code>SetupPlayerInputComponent</code> function. In the body of the function, we will use the <code>Super</code> keyword to call it:<pre>//Not always necessary, but good practice to call the 
//function inthe base class with Super.
Super::SetupPlayerInputComponent(PlayerInputComponent);</pre></li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>Super</code> keyword enables us to call the <code>SetupPlayerInputComponent</code> parent method. With the <code>SetupPlayerInputComponent</code> function ready, you need to include the following header files to continue with this exercise without any compile errors:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>#include “Components/InputComponent.h”</code></li>
<li><code>#include “GameFramework/CharacterMovementComponent.h”</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You will need to include the header for the input component to bind the key mappings to the sprint functions you will be creating next. The header for the <code>Character Movement</code> component will be necessary for the sprint functions because you will be updating the <code>Max Walk Speed</code> parameter based on whether the player is sprinting. The following code contains all of the headers that need to be<a id="_idIndexMarker916"/> included for the player character:</p>
<pre>#include "SuperSideScroller_Player.h"
#include "Components/InputComponent"
#include "GameFramework/CharacterMovementComponent.h"</pre>
<p>With the necessary headers included in the source file of the <code>SuperSideScroller_Player</code> class, you can create the sprint functions to make the player character move faster. Let’s begin by declaring the required variable and functions.</p>
<ol>
<li value="6">Under the <code>Private</code> access modifier in the header file of the <code>SuperSideScroller_Player</code> class, declare a new Boolean variable called <code>bIsSprinting</code>. This variable will be used as a failsafe so that you know whether the player character is sprinting before making any changes to the movement speed:<pre>private:
//Bool to control if we are sprinting. Failsafe.
bool bIsSprinting;</pre></li>
<li>Next, declare two new functions, <code>Sprint();</code> and <code>StopSprinting();</code>. These two functions will not take any arguments and will not return anything. Declare these functions under the <code>Protected</code> access modifier: <pre>//Sprinting
void Sprint();
//StopSprinting
void StopSprinting();</pre></li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>Sprint();</code> function will be called when the player presses/holds the <code>Sprint</code> key <a id="_idIndexMarker917"/>mapped to the binding; <code>StopSprinting()</code> will be called when the player releases the key mapped to the binding. </p>
<ol>
<li value="8">Start with the definition of the <code>Sprint();</code> function. In the source file of the <code>SuperSideScroller_Player</code> class, create the definition for this function, as shown here:<pre>void ASuperSideScroller_Player::Sprint()
{
}</pre></li>
<li>Within the function, you will want to check the value of the <code>bIsSprinting</code> variable. If the player is <em class="italic">NOT</em> sprinting, meaning that <code>bIsSprinting</code> is <code>False</code>, then you can create the rest of the function. </li>
<li>Within the <code>If</code> statement, set the <code>bIsSprinting</code> variable to <code>True</code>. Then, access the <code>GetCharacterMovement()</code> function and modify the <code>MaxWalkSpeed</code> parameter. Set <code>MaxWalkSpeed</code> to <code>500.0f</code>. Remember that the <code>Maximum Axis Value</code> parameter of the movement Blend Space is <code>500.0f</code>. This means that the player character will reach the speed necessary to use the <code>Running</code> animation:<pre>void ASuperSideScroller_Player::Sprint()
{
    if (!bIsSprinting)
      {
        bIsSprinting = true;
        GetCharacterMovement()-&gt;MaxWalkSpeed = 500.0f;
      }
}</pre></li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>StopSprinting()</code> function will look almost identical to the <code>Sprint()</code> function you<a id="_idIndexMarker918"/> just wrote, but it works in the opposite manner. First, you want to check whether the player is sprinting, meaning that <code>bIsSprinting</code> is <code>True</code>. If so, you can create the rest of the function. </p>
<ol>
<li value="11">Inside the <code>If</code> statement, set <code>bIsSprinting</code> to <code>False</code>. Then, access the <code>GetCharacterMovement()</code> function to modify <code>MaxWalkSpeed</code>. Set <code>MaxWalkSpeed</code> back to <code>300.0f</code>, which is the default speed for the player character when they’re walking. This means that the player character will only reach the speed that’s necessary for the <code>Walking</code> animation:<pre>void ASuperSideScroller_Player::StopSprinting()
{
   if (bIsSprinting)
    {
     bIsSprinting = false;
      GetCharacterMovement()-&gt;MaxWalkSpeed = 300.0f;
    }
}</pre></li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you have the functions needed for sprinting, it is time to bind these functions to the action mappings you created earlier. To do this, you need to create variables that hold a reference to the Input Mapping Context and Input Action that were created earlier in this chapter.</p>
<ol>
<li value="12">Inside the <code>SuperSideScroller_Player</code> header file, under the <strong class="bold">Protected</strong> category, add the following lines of code to create the properties for the Input Mapping <a id="_idIndexMarker919"/>Context and Input Action:<pre>UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = "Input")
class UInputMappingContext* IC_Character;
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = "Input")
class UInputAction* IA_Sprint;</pre></li>
</ol>
<p>We must remember to assign these properties within our character Blueprint before we attempt to test the sprinting functionality.</p>
<ol>
<li value="13">Next, inside the <code>SuperSideScroller_Player</code> source file, within the <code>SetupPlayerInputComponent()</code> function, we need to get a reference to the Enhanced Input Component by writing the following code:<pre>UEnhancedInputComponent* EnhancedPlayerInput = Cast&lt;UEnhancedInputComponent&gt;(PlayerInputComponent);</pre></li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we are referencing <code>UEnhancedInputComponent</code>, we need to remember to include this class as well:</p>
<pre>#include "EnhancedInputComponent.h"</pre>
<p>Since we want to support both legacy input and the Enhanced Input System, let’s add a specific <code>if</code> statement to our code to check if the <code>EnhancedPlayerInput</code> variable is valid:</p>
<pre>if(EnhancedPlayerInput)
{}</pre>
<p>If the <code>EnhancedPlayerInput</code> variable is valid, then we want to get a reference to our Player Controller so that we can get access to the <code>EnhancedInputLocalPlayerSubsystem</code> class, which will allow us to assign our Input Mapping Context:</p>
<pre>if(EnhancedPlayerInput)
{
   APlayerController* PlayerController = 
   Cast&lt;APlayerController&gt;(GetController());
UEnhancedInputLocalPlayerSubsystem* EnhancedSubsystem = ULocalPlayer::GetSubsystem&lt;UEnhancedInputLocal PlayerSubsystem&gt; (PlayerController-&gt;GetLocalPlayer());
}</pre>
<ol>
<li value="14">Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker920"/>we are referencing the <code>UEnhancedInputLocalPlayerSubsystem</code> class, we need to add the following <code>include</code> header file:<pre>#include "EnhancedInputSubsystems.h"</pre></li>
<li>Finally, we will add another <code>if</code> statement that checks if the <code>EnhancedSubsystem</code> variable is valid and then call the <code>AddMappingContext</code> function to add our <code>IC_Character</code> Input Mapping Context to our Player Controller:<pre>if(EnhancedSubsystem)
{
   EnhancedSubsystem-&gt;AddMappingContext(IC_Character, 
   1);
}</pre></li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we have applied the Input Mapping Context to the player characters’ <code>EnhancedSubsystem</code>, we can bind the <code>Sprint()</code> and <code>StopSprinting()</code> functions to the Input Action we created earlier.</p>
<ol>
<li value="16">At the end of the <code>if(EnhancedPlayerInput)</code> statement, we will add a <code>BindAction</code> to bind <code>ETriggerEvent::Triggered</code> to the <code>Sprint()</code> function:<pre>//Bind pressed action Sprint to your Sprint function
EnhancedPlayerInput-&gt;BindAction(IA_Sprint, ETriggerEvent::Triggered, this, &amp;ASuperSideScroller_Player::Sprint);</pre></li>
<li>Finally, we <a id="_idIndexMarker921"/>can add our <code>BindAction</code> to bind <code>ETriggerEvent::Completed</code> to the <code>StopSprinting()</code> function:<pre>//Bind released action Sprint to your StopSprinting 
//function
EnhancedPlayerInput-&gt;BindAction(IA_Sprint, ETriggerEvent::Completed, this, &amp;ASuperSideScroller_Player::StopSprinting);</pre></li>
</ol>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">For more information regarding the <code>ETriggerEvent</code> enumerator type, as well as more details about the Enhanced Input System, please revisit <a href="B18531_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor099"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting Started with Player Input</em>, or refer to the following documentation from Epic Games: <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/GameplayFeatures/EnhancedInput/%0D">https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/GameplayFeatures/EnhancedInput/.</a></p>
<p>With <code>Action Mappings</code> bound to the sprint functions, the last thing you need to do is set the default initialized values of the <code>bIsSprinting</code> variable and the <code>MaxWalkSpeed</code> parameter from the <code>Character Movement</code> component.</p>
<ol>
<li value="18">Inside the <code>constructor</code> function in the source file of your <code>SuperSideScroller_Player</code> class, add the <code>bIsSprinting = false</code> line. This variable is constructed as false because the player character should not be sprinting by default.</li>
<li>Finally, set the <code>MaxWalkSpeed</code> parameter of the character movement component to <code>300.0f</code> by adding <code>GetCharacterMovement()-&gt;MaxWalkSpeed = 300.0f</code>. Please<a id="_idIndexMarker922"/> review the following code:<pre>ASuperSideScroller_Player::ASuperSideScroller_Player()
{
  //Set sprinting to false by default.
   bIsSprinting = false;
  //Set our max Walk Speed to 300.0f
   GetCharacterMovement()-&gt;MaxWalkSpeed = 300.0f;
}</pre></li>

<p>With the variables that have been added to the constructor initialized, the <code>SuperSideScroller_Player</code> class is done, for now. Return to Unreal Engine and left-click on the <strong class="bold">Compile</strong> button on the toolbar. This will recompile the code and perform a hot-reload of the editor. </p>
<p>After recompiling and hot-reloading the editor, we need to remember to assign both the Input Mapping Context and the Input Action inside our player character.</p>

<p>With the player <a id="_idIndexMarker924"/>character able to sprint, let’s move on to the next activity, where you will implement the base <code>Throw</code> functionality in a very similar way.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor239"/>Activity 11.03 – implementing the throwing input</h2>
<p>One of the features<a id="_idIndexMarker925"/> included with this game is the ability for the player to throw projectiles at the enemy. You won’t be creating the projectile or implementing the animation in this chapter, but you will set up the key bindings and the C++ implementation for use in the next chapter. </p>
<p>In this activity, you need to set up the Enhanced Input Mapping for the <code>Throw</code> projectile functionality and implement a debug log in C++ for when the player presses the key(s) mapped to <code>Throw</code>.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to complete this activity:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Create a new folder inside of the <code>Throw</code>, and create a new <code>IA_Throw</code>.</li>
<li>Use the <code>Trigger</code> type called <code>Pressed</code> inside <code>IA_Throw</code>.</li>
<li>Add the new <code>IA_Throw</code> <code>IC_SideScrollerCharacter</code> with bindings to both <code>Left Mouse Button</code> and <code>Gamepad Right Trigger</code>.</li>
<li>Within Visual Studio, add a new <code>UInputAction</code> variable called <code>IA_Throw</code> and add the appropriate <code>UPROPERTY()</code> macro to the variable.</li>
<li>Add a new function to the header file of <code>SuperSideScroller_Player</code>. Name this function <code>ThrowProjectile()</code>. This will be a void function without parameters.</li>
<li>Create the definition in the source file of the <code>SuperSideScroller_Player</code> class. In the definition of this function, use <code>UE_LOG</code> to print a message that lets you know that the function is being called successfully.</li>
<li>Add a new <code>BindAction</code> function call using the <code>EnhancedPlayerInput</code> variable to <a id="_idIndexMarker926"/>bind the new <code>Throw</code> <code>ThrowProjectile()</code> function.</li>
</ol>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">You can learn more about <code>UE_LOG</code> here: <a href="https://nerivec.github.io/old-ue4-wiki/pages/logs-printing-messages-to-yourself-during-runtime.xhtml">https://nerivec.github.io/old-ue4-wiki/pages/logs-printing-messages-to-yourself-during-runtime.xhtml</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li value="8">Compile the code and return to the editor. Next, add <code>IA_Throw</code> to the <code>BP_SuperSideScroller_MainCharacter</code> parameter, <code>IA_Throw</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The expected result is that when you use the <em class="italic">left mouse button</em> or the <em class="italic">gamepad right trigger</em>, a log will appear in <code>Output Log</code>, letting you know that the <code>ThrowProjectile</code> function is being called successfully. You will use this function later to spawn your projectile.</p>

<p>With this activity complete, you now have functionality in place for when you create the player projectile in <a href="B18531_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor268"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating and Adding the Enemy Artificial Intelligence</em>. You also have the knowledge and experience of adding new key mappings to your game and implementing functionality in C++ that utilizes these mappings to enable gameplay functionality. Now, you will continue<a id="_idIndexMarker927"/> updating the player character’s movement to allow the jumping animation to play correctly when the player jumps. But first, let’s take a moment to learn about Animation State Machines.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-212"><a id="_idTextAnchor240"/>Using Animation State Machines</h1>
<p>State Machines <a id="_idIndexMarker928"/>are a means of categorizing an animation, or sets of animations, into a state. A state can be thought of as a condition that the player character is in at a specific time. Is the player currently walking? Is the player jumping? In many third-person games such as <em class="italic">The Last of Us</em>, this involves separating the movement, jumping, crouching, and climbing animations into their own states. Each state is then accessible when certain conditions are met while the game is played. Conditions can include whether the player is jumping, the speed of the player character, and whether or not the player is in the crouched state. The job of the state machine is to transition between each state using logical decisions <a id="_idIndexMarker929"/>called <code>ThirdPerson_AnimBP</code> Animation Blueprint:</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">A general overview of State Machines can be found here: <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Animation/StateMachines/Overview/index.xhtml">https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Animation/StateMachines/Overview/index.xhtml</a>.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 11.37 – The state machine of ThirdPerson_AnimBP " height="691" src="img/Figure_11.37_B18531.jpg" width="1148"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.37 – The state machine of ThirdPerson_AnimBP</p>
<p>In the case of the <a id="_idIndexMarker930"/>state machine for the player character, this state machine will handle the states of the default player’s movement and jumping. Currently, you have the player character animating simply by using a Blend Space that is controlled by the speed of the character. In the next exercise, you will create a new state machine and move the movement Blend Space logic into its own state within that state machine. Let’s start creating the new state machine.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-213"><a id="_idTextAnchor241"/>Exercise 11.07 – player character movement and jump state machine</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you <a id="_idIndexMarker931"/>will<a id="_idIndexMarker932"/> implement a new animation state machine and integrate the existing movement Blend Space into the state machine. Additionally, you will set up the states for when the player jump starts, and for when the player is in the air during that jump.</p>
<p>Let’s start by adding this new state machine:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Navigate to the <code>/MainCharacter/Blueprints/</code> directory and open the <code>AnimBP_SuperSideScroller_MainCharacter</code> Animation Blueprint.</li>
<li>In <code>state machine</code> inside the context-sensitive search to find the <code>Add New State Machine</code> option. Name this new state machine <code>Movement</code>.</li>
<li>Now, instead of plugging the output pose of the <code>SideScroller_IdleRun</code> Blend Space, we can connect the output pose of the new state machine, <code>Movement</code>, to the output pose of the animation:</li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 11.38 – The new Movement state machine replaces the old Blend Space " height="501" src="img/Figure_11.38_B18531.jpg" width="961"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.38 – The new Movement state machine replaces the old Blend Space</p>
<p>Connecting an empty state machine to the <code>Output Pose</code> property of the Animation Blueprint will result in the warnings shown in the following screenshot. All this means is that nothing is happening within that state machine and that the result will be invalid to <code>Output Pose</code>. Don’t worry; you will fix this next:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 11.39 – The empty state machine results in compile warnings " height="166" src="img/Figure_11.39_B18531.jpg" width="1298"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.39 – The empty state machine results in compile warnings</p>
<p>Double left-click on<a id="_idIndexMarker933"/> the <code>Movement</code> state <a id="_idIndexMarker934"/>machine to open the state machine itself. </p>
<p>You will start by adding a new state that will handle what the character was doing previously; that is <code>Idle</code>, <code>Walking</code>, or <code>Running</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li value="4">From the <code>Entry</code> point, left-click and drag out to open the context-sensitive search. You will notice that there are only two options – <code>Add Conduit</code> and <code>Add State</code>. For now, you will add a new state and name this state <code>Movement</code>. The following screenshot shows how the <code>Movement</code> state was created:</li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 11.40 – Inside the state machine, you need to add a new state " height="214" src="img/Figure_11.40_B18531.jpg" width="650"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.40 – Inside the state machine, you need to add a new state</p>
<ol>
<li value="5">After <a id="_idIndexMarker935"/>selecting <code>Add</code> <code>State</code>, you can rename the state to <code>Movement</code> and it should automatically connect to the <code>Entry</code> node of the State Machine.</li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 11.41 – The new Movement state " height="198" src="img/Figure_11.41_B18531.jpg" width="812"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.41 – The new Movement state</p>
<ol>
<li value="6">Copy and paste the logic you had where you connected the <code>Speed</code> variable to the <code>SideScroller_IdleRun</code> Blend Space into the new <code>Movement</code> state you created<a id="_idIndexMarker936"/> in the previous <a id="_idIndexMarker937"/>step. Connect it to the <code>Result</code> pin of the <code>Output Animation Pose</code> node of this state:</li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 11.42 – Connecting the output pose of the Blend Space to the output pose of this state " height="366" src="img/Figure_11.42_B18531.jpg" width="1015"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.42 – Connecting the output pose of the Blend Space to the output pose of this state</p>
<p>Now, if you recompile the Animation Blueprint, you will notice that the warnings you saw earlier are now gone. This is because you added a new state that outputs an animation to <code>Output Animation Pose</code> instead of having an empty state machine.</p>
<p>By completing this exercise, you have constructed your very first state machine. Although it is a very simple one, you are now telling the character to enter and use the <code>Movement</code> state by default. Now, if you use <code>PIE</code>, you will see that the player character is moving around like they were earlier before you made the state machine. This means that your state machine is functioning and that you can continue to the next step, which will be adding the<a id="_idIndexMarker938"/> initial states <a id="_idIndexMarker939"/>that are required for jumping. Let’s start by creating the <code>JumpStart</code> state.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-214"><a id="_idTextAnchor242"/>Transition rules</h2>
<p>Conduits are a <a id="_idIndexMarker940"/>way of telling each state the<a id="_idIndexMarker941"/> conditions under which it can transition from one state to another. In this case, a Transition Rule is created as a connection between the <code>Movement</code> and <code>JumpStart</code> states. This is indicated by the directional arrow of the connection between the states again. The tooltip mentions the term Transition Rule, which means that you need to define how the transition between these states will happen, using a Boolean value to do so:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 11.43 – There needs to be a Transition Rule to go from Movement to the start of JumpStart " height="385" src="img/Figure_11.43_B18531.jpg" width="867"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.43 – There needs to be a Transition Rule to go from Movement to the start of JumpStart</p>
<p>The main difference between a simple Transition Rule and a conduit is that a Transition Rule can only connect between two states, whereas a conduit can serve as a means to transition between one and many other states. For more information, please refer to the following documentation: <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/state-machines-in-unreal-engine/#conduits">https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/state-machines-in-unreal-engine/#conduits</a>.</p>
<p>In the next<a id="_idIndexMarker942"/> exercise, you will be adding this new <code>JumpStart</code> state and adding the proper Transition Rule necessary for the character to go from the <code>Movement</code> state to the <code>JumpStart</code> state.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-215"><a id="_idTextAnchor243"/>Exercise 11.08 – adding states and transition rules to the state machine</h2>
<p>In the case <a id="_idIndexMarker943"/>of transitioning<a id="_idIndexMarker944"/> from<a id="_idIndexMarker945"/> the player character’s default movement Blend Space to the beginning of the jump animation, you will need to know when the player decides to jump. This can be done using a useful function called <code>IsFalling</code> from the <code>Character Movement</code> component of the player character. You will want to track whether the player is currently falling to transition in and out of jumping. The best way to do this is to store the result of the <code>IsFalling</code> function in its own variable, just like you did when tracking the player’s speed.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to complete this exercise:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Back in the overview of the state machine itself, left-click and drag from the edge of the <code>Movement</code> state to open the context-sensitive menu.</li>
<li>Select the <code>JumpStart</code>. When you do this, Unreal Engine will automatically connect these states and implement an empty Transition Rule for you:</li>

<p>Here, you<a id="_idIndexMarker961"/> are <a id="_idIndexMarker962"/>setting<a id="_idIndexMarker963"/> the <code>Loop Animation</code> parameter to <code>False</code> because there is no reason that this animation should loop; it should only play once in any case. The only way that this animation would loop is if the player character is somehow stuck in this state, but this will never happen because of the next state you will create. The reason for setting <code>Play Rate</code> to <code>2.0</code> is because the animation itself, <code>JumpingStart</code>, is too long for the game you are making. The animation has the character bend their knees drastically, and jump upward for more than a second. For the <code>JumpStart</code> state, you want the character to play this animation quicker so that it is more fluid and offers a smoother transition to the next state; that is, <code>JumpLoop</code>. To give additional context to the <code>Play Rate</code> parameter that’s available in an animation, there is both <code>Play Rate</code> and <code>Play Rate Basis</code>. The <code>Play Rate Basis</code> parameter allows you to change where the <code>Play Rate</code> parameter is expressed; so, by default, this is set to 1.0. If you wanted to, you could change this value to 10.0, meaning that the <code>Play Rate</code> input will be divided by 10. So, depending on <code>Play Rate Basis</code>, the value that’s used in <code>Play Rate</code> can lead to different results; for simplicity, we will keep <code>Play Rate Basis</code> at its default value of 1.0.</p>
<p>Once the player character has begun the <code>JumpStart</code> animation, there is a point in time during that animation where the player is in the air and should transition to a new state. This new state will loop until the player is no longer in the air and can transition into the final state of ending the jump. Next, we will create a new state that will transition from the <code>JumpStart</code> state.</p>
<ol>
<li value="11">From the state machine graph, <em class="italic">left-click</em> and drag from the <code>JumpStart</code> state and select the <code>Add State</code> option. Name this new state <code>JumpLoop</code>. Again, Unreal Engine will automatically provide you with a <code>Transition Rule</code> between <a id="_idIndexMarker964"/>these states that you will add to in the next exercise. Finally, recompile the Animation Blueprint and ignore any warnings that may appear under <strong class="bold">Compiler Results</strong>:</li>

<p>By completing this exercise, you have added and connected states for <code>JumpStart</code> and <code>JumpLoop</code>. Each of these states is connected via a <code>Transition Rule</code>. You should now have a better understanding of how states within a state machine transition from one to <a id="_idIndexMarker965"/>another via the <a id="_idIndexMarker966"/>rules <a id="_idIndexMarker967"/>established in each Transition Rule.</p>
<p>In the next exercise, you will learn how to transition from the <code>JumpStart</code> state to the <code>JumpLoop</code> state via the <code>Time Remaining Ratio</code> function.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-216"><a id="_idTextAnchor244"/>Exercise 11.09 – The Time Remaining Ratio function</h2>
<p>For <a id="_idIndexMarker968"/>the <code>JumpStart</code> state to smoothly<a id="_idIndexMarker969"/> transition to the <code>JumpLoop</code> state, you need to take a moment to think about exactly how you want this transition to work. Based on how the <code>JumpStart</code> and <code>JumpLoop</code> animations work, it is best to transition to the <code>JumpLoop</code> animation after a specified set of time has elapsed on the <code>JumpStart</code> animation. That way, the <code>JumpLoop</code> state plays smoothly after <code>X</code> seconds of the <code>JumpStart</code> animation playing.</p>
<p>Perform the following steps to achieve this: </p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Double left-click on the <code>Transition Rule</code> property between <code>JumpStart</code> and <code>JumpLoop</code> to open its graph. This <code>Transition Rule</code> will check how much time is remaining from the <code>JumpingStart</code> animation. This is done because a certain percentage of time remains in the <code>JumpingStart</code> animation, and you can safely assume that the player is in the air and is ready to transition to the <code>JumpingLoop</code> animation state. </li>
<li>To do this, make sure that the <code>JumpingStart</code> animation is selected in the <code>Event Graph</code> of <code>Transition Rule</code> and find the <code>Time Remaining Ratio</code> function. </li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s take a moment to talk about the <code>Time Remaining Ratio</code> function and what it is doing. This function returns a float between <code>0.0f</code> and <code>1.0f</code> that tells you how much time is remaining in the specified animation. The values <code>0.0f</code> and <code>1.0f</code> can directly be translated into a percentage value so that they are easier<a id="_idIndexMarker970"/> to consider. In the <a id="_idIndexMarker971"/>case of the <code>JumpingStart</code> animation, you want to know whether less than 60% of the animation is remaining to transition successfully to the <code>JumpingLoop</code> state. This is what you will do now.</p>
<ol>
<li value="3">From the <code>Return Value</code> float output parameter of the <code>Time Remaining Ratio</code> function, search for the <code>Less Than comparative operative</code> node from the context-sensitive search menu. Since you are working with a returned value between <code>0.0f</code> and <code>1.0f</code> to find out whether less than 60% of the animation remains, you need to compare this returned value with a value of <code>0.6f</code>. The final result is as follows:</li>
</ol>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.54 – The new Transition Rule between the JumpingStart and JumpingLoop states</p>
<p>With this <code>Transition Rule</code> in place, all you need to do is add the <code>JumpLoop</code> animation to the <code>JumpLoop</code> state. </p>
<ol>
<li value="4">In the <code>Movement</code> state machine, double left-click on the <code>JumpLoop</code> state to enter its graph. With the <code>JumpLoop</code> animation asset selected in the <code>Result</code> input of <code>Output Animation Pose</code>, as shown in the following screenshot. The<a id="_idIndexMarker972"/> default <a id="_idIndexMarker973"/>settings of the <code>Play JumpLoop</code> node will remain unchanged:</li>
</ol>

<p>With the <code>JumpLoop</code> animation in place in the <code>JumpLoop</code> state, you can compile the Animation Blueprint and PIE. You will notice that the movement and sprinting animations are still present, but what happens when you try to jump? The player character begins the <code>JumpStart</code> state and plays the <code>JumpLoop</code> animation while in the air. This is great – the state machine is working, but what happens when the player character reaches the ground and is no longer in the air? The player character does not transition back to the <code>Movement</code> state, which makes sense because you haven’t added the state for <code>JumpEnd</code>, nor the transitions between <code>JumpLoop</code> and <code>JumpEnd</code>, and from <code>JumpEnd</code> back to the <code>Movement</code> state. You will do this in the next activity. The following screenshot<a id="_idIndexMarker974"/> shows an example <a id="_idIndexMarker975"/>of a player character stuck in the <code>JumpLoop</code> state:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 11.56 – The player character can now play the JumpingStart and JumpLoop animations " height="584" src="img/Figure_11.56_B18531.jpg" width="1158"/>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.56 – The player character can now play the JumpingStart and JumpLoop animations</p>
<p>By completing this exercise, you successfully transitioned from the <code>JumpStart</code> state to the <code>JumpLoop</code> state by using the <code>Time Remaining Ratio</code> function. This function allows you to know how far along an animation has played, and with this information, you had the state machine transition into the <code>JumpLoop</code> state. The player can now successfully transition from the default <code>Movement</code> state to the <code>JumpStart</code> state and then to the <code>JumpLoop</code> state. However, this results in an interesting issue: the player is now stuck in the <code>JumpLoop</code> state because the state machine does not contain the transition <a id="_idIndexMarker976"/>backs<a id="_idIndexMarker977"/> to the <code>Movement</code> state. We’ll fix this in the next activity.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-217"><a id="_idTextAnchor245"/>Activity 11.04 – finishing the Movement and Jumping state machines</h2>
<p>With half of the <a id="_idIndexMarker978"/>state <a id="_idIndexMarker979"/>machine completed, it’s time to add the state for when the jump ends, as well as the Transition Rules that allow you to transition from the <code>JumpLoop</code> state to this new state, and then transition from this new state back to the <code>Movement</code> state. </p>
<p>Follow these steps to complete the <code>Movement</code> state machine:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Add a new state for <code>Jump End</code> that transitions from <code>JumpLoop</code>. Name this state <code>JumpEnd</code>.</li>
<li>Add the <code>JumpEnd</code> animation to the new <code>JumpEnd</code> state.</li>
<li>Based on the <code>JumpEnd</code> animation and how quickly we want to transition between the <code>JumpLoop</code>, <code>JumpEnd</code>, and <code>Movement</code> states, consider modifying the parameters of the animation like you did for the <code>JumpStart</code> animation. The <code>loop animation</code> parameter needs to be <code>False</code> and the <code>Play Rate</code> parameter needs to be set to <code>3.0</code>.</li>
<li>Add a <code>Transition Rule</code> from the <code>JumpLoop</code> state to the <code>JumpEnd</code> state based on the <code>bIsInAir</code> variable.</li>
<li>Add a <code>Transition Rule</code> from the <code>JumpEnd</code> state to the <code>Movement</code> state based on the <code>Time Remaining Ratio</code> function of the <code>JumpEnd</code> animation. (Look at the <code>JumpStart</code> to <code>JumpLoop</code> Transition Rule).</li>
</ol>
<p>By the end <a id="_idIndexMarker980"/>of<a id="_idIndexMarker981"/> this activity, you will have a fully functioning movement state machine that allows the player character to idle, walk, and sprint, as well as jump and animate correctly at the start of the jump, while in the air, and when landing.</p>
<p>The expected output is as follows:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 11.57 – The player character can now idle, walk, sprint, and jump " height="633" src="img/Figure_11.57_B18531.jpg" width="1288"/>

<p>By completing this activity, you have finished the <code>Movement</code> state machine for the player character. By adding the remaining <code>JumpEnd</code> state and <code>Transition Rules</code> to transition to <a id="_idIndexMarker982"/>the <a id="_idIndexMarker983"/><code>JumpEnd</code> state from the <code>JumpLoop</code> state, and to transition from the <code>JumpEnd</code> state back to the <code>Movement</code> state, you have successfully created your first animation state machine. Now, you can run around the map and jump onto elevated platforms, all while animating correctly and transitioning between the <code>Movement</code> and jump states.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-218"><a id="_idTextAnchor246"/>Summary</h1>
<p>With the player movement Blend Space created and the player character Animation Blueprint using a State Machine to transition from movement to jumping, you are ready to move on to the next chapter, where you will prepare the required animation slot and animation montage, and then update the Animation Blueprint for the throw animation, which will only use the upper body of the character.</p>
<p>From the exercises and activities in this chapter, you learned how to create a Blend Space 1D that allows you to smoothly blend movement-based animations such as idling, walking, and running using the speed of the player character to control the blending of animations. </p>
<p>Additionally, you learned how to integrate new key bindings into the project settings and bind those keys in C++ to enable character gameplay mechanics such as sprinting and throwing.</p>
<p>Lastly, you learned how to implement your very own animation state machine within the character Animation Blueprint for the player to transition between movement animations, to the various states of jumping, and back to movement again. With all of this logic in place, in the next chapter, we’ll create the assets and logic that allow the player character to play the throwing animation, and set up the base class for the enemy.</p>
