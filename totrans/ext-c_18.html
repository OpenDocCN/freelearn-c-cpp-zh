			<h1 id="_idParaDest-241" class="chapterTitle" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor462"/>Process Synchronization</h1>
			<p class="normal">This chapter continues our discussion in the previous chapter,<em class="italics"> Process Execution</em>, and our main focus will be on process synchronization. Control mechanisms in multi-process programs are different from the control techniques we<a id="_idIndexMarker1240"/> met in multi-threaded programs. It is not just the memory which differs; there are other factors that you cannot find in a multi-threaded program, and they exist in a multi-process environment.</p>
			<p class="normal">Despite threads that are bound to a process, processes can live freely on any machine, with any operating system, located anywhere within a network as big as the internet. As you might imagine, things become complicated. It will not be easy to synchronize a number of processes in such a distributed system.</p>
			<p class="normal">This chapter is dedicated to process synchronization happening in just one machine. In other words, it mainly talks about single-host synchronization and the techniques around it. We discuss briefly the process synchronization in distributed systems, but we won't go into extensive detai<a id="_idTextAnchor463"/>l.</p>
			<p class="normal">This chapter covers the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="list">Firstly, we describe multi-process software where all processes are being run on the same machine. We introduce the techniques that are available in single-host environments. We use the knowledge from the previous chapter in order to give some examples that demonstrate these techniques.</li>
				<li class="list">In our first attempt to synchronize a number of processes, we use named POSIX semaphores. We explain how they should be used and then we give an example that resolves a race condition issue we encountered in the previous chapters.</li>
				<li class="list">After that, we talk about named POSIX mutexes and we show how we can use shared memory regions to have named mutexes up and working. As an example, we solve the same race condition resolved by semaphores, this time using named mutexes.</li>
				<li class="list">As the last technique to synchronize a number of processes, we discuss named POSIX condition variables. Like named mutexes, they need to be put in a shared memory region to become accessible to a number of processes. We give a thorough example regarding this technique which shows how named POSIX condition variables can be used to synchronize a multi-process system.</li>
				<li class="list">As our final discussion in this chapter, we briefly talk about the multi-process systems which have their own processes distributed around a network. We discuss their features and the problematic differences that they have in comparison to a single-host multi-process system.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">Let us start the chapter with talking a bit more about single-host concurrency control and what techniques are available as part of it.<a id="_idTextAnchor464"/></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-242" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor465"/>Single-host concurrency control</h1>
			<p class="normal">It is pretty common to be in <a id="_idIndexMarker1241"/>situations where there are a number of processes running on a single machine that, at the same time, need to have simultaneous access to a shared resource. Since all of the processes are running within the same operating system, they have access to all the facilities which their operating system provides.</p>
			<p class="normal">In this section, we show how to use some of these facilities to create a control mechanism that synchronizes the processes. Shared memory plays a key role in most of these control mechanisms; therefore, we heavily rely on what we explained about shared memory in the previous chapter.</p>
			<p class="normal">The following is a list of POSIX-provided control mechanisms that can be employed while all processes are running on the same POSIX-compliant machine:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="list"><strong class="bold">Named POSIX semaphores</strong>: The same POSIX semaphores that we explained in <em class="italics">Chapter 16</em>, <em class="italics">Thread Synchronization</em>, but with <a id="_idIndexMarker1242"/>one difference: they have a name now and can<a id="_idIndexMarker1243"/> be used globally throughout the system. In other words, they are not <em class="italics">anonymous</em> or <em class="italics">private</em> semaphores anymore.</li>
				<li class="list"><strong class="bold">Named mutexes</strong>: Again, the same <a id="_idIndexMarker1244"/>POSIX mutexes <a id="_idIndexMarker1245"/>with the same properties which were explained in <em class="italics">Chapter 16</em>, <em class="italics">Thread Synchronization</em>, but now named and can be used throughout the system. These mutexes should be placed inside a shared memory in order to be available to multiple processes.</li>
				<li class="list"><strong class="bold">Named condition variables</strong>: The same POSIX condition<a id="_idIndexMarker1246"/> variables which we explained in <em class="italics">Chapter 16</em>, <em class="italics">Thread Synchronization</em>, but like mutexes, they should be placed inside a shared <a id="_idIndexMarker1247"/>memory object in order to be available to a number of processes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">In the upcoming sections, we discuss all the above techniques and give examples to demonstrate how they work. In the following section, we are going to discuss named POSIX sema<a id="_idTextAnchor466"/>phores.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-243" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor467"/>Named POSIX semaphores</h1>
			<p class="normal">As you saw in <em class="italics">Chapter 16</em>, <em class="italics">Thread Synchronization</em>, semaphores are the main tool to synchronize a number of concurrent tasks. We saw them in multi-threaded programs and saw how they help to overcome the concurrency issues.</p>
			<p class="normal">In this section, we are<a id="_idIndexMarker1248"/> going to show how they can be used among some processes. <em class="italics">Example 18.1</em> shows how to use a POSIX semaphore to solve the data races we encountered in <em class="italics">examples 17.6</em> and <em class="italics">17.7</em> given in the previous chapter, <em class="italics">Process Execution</em>. The example is remarkably similar to <em class="italics">example 17.6</em>, and it again uses a shared memory region for storing the shared counter variable. But it uses named semaphores to synchronize the access to the shared counter.</p>
			<p class="normal">The following code boxes show the way that we use a named semaphore to synchronize two processes while accessing a shared variable. The following code box shows the global declarations of <em class="italics">example 18.1</em>:</p>
			<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
...
#include &lt;semaphore.h&gt;  // For using semaphores
#define SHARED_MEM_SIZE 4
// Shared file descriptor used to refer to the
// shared memory object
int shared_fd = -1;
// The pointer to the shared counter
int32_t* counter = NULL;
// The pointer to the shared semaphore
sem_t* semaphore = NULL;</pre>
			<p class="packt_figref">Code Box 18-1 [ExtremeC_examples_chapter18_1.c]: The global declarations of example 18.1</p>
			<p class="normal">In <em class="italics">Code Box 18-1</em>, we have declared a global counter and a global pointer to a semaphore object which <a id="_idIndexMarker1249"/>will be set later. This pointer will be used by both parent and child processes to have synchronized access to the shared counter, addressed by the counter pointer.</p>
			<p class="normal">The following code shows the function definitions supposed to do the actual process synchronization. Some of the definitions are the same as we had in <em class="italics">example 17.6</em> and those lines are removed from the following code box:</p>
			<pre>void <strong class="highlight">init_control_mechanism()</strong> {
  semaphore = sem_open("/sem0", O_CREAT | O_EXCL, 0600, 1);
  if (semaphore == SEM_FAILED) {
    fprintf(stderr, "ERROR: Opening the semaphore failed: %s\n",
        strerror(errno));
    exit(1);
  }
}
void <strong class="highlight">shutdown_control_mechanism()</strong> {
  if (sem_close(semaphore) &lt; 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "ERROR: Closing the semaphore failed: %s\n",
        strerror(errno));
    exit(1);
  }
  if (sem_unlink("/sem0") &lt; 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "ERROR: Unlinking failed: %s\n",
        strerror(errno));
    exit(1);
  }
}
void <strong class="highlight">init_shared_resource()</strong> {
  ... as in the example 17.6 ...
}
void <strong class="highlight">shutdown_shared_resource()</strong> {
  ... as in the example 17.6 ...
}</pre>
			<p class="packt_figref">Code Box 18-2 [ExtremeC_examples_chapter18_1.c]: The definition of synchronization functions</p>
			<p class="normal">We have added<a id="_idIndexMarker1250"/> two new functions compared to <em class="italics">example 17.6</em>: <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">init_control_mechanism</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">shutdown_control_mechanism</code>. We also made some changes to the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">inc_counter</code> function (shown in <em class="italics">Code Box 18-3</em>) to use the semaphore and form a critical section inside.</p>
			<p class="normal">Inside the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">init_control_mechanism</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">shutdown_control_mechanism</code> functions, we are using a similar API to the shared memory API to open, close, and unlink a named semaphore.</p>
			<p class="normal">The functions <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">sem_open</code>, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">sem_close</code>, and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">sem_unlink</code> can be seen as similar to <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">shm_open</code>, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">shm_close</code>, and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">shm_unlink</code>. There is one difference and that is that the function <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">sem_open</code> returns a semaphore pointer instead of a file descriptor.</p>
			<p class="normal">Note that the API used for working with the semaphore in this example is the same as we have seen before, so the rest of the code can remain unchanged as with <em class="italics">example 17.6</em>. In this example, the semaphore is initialized with value <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">1</code>, which makes it a mutex. The following code box shows the critical section and how the semaphore is used to synchronize the read and write operations performed on the shared counter:</p>
			<pre>void <strong class="highlight">inc_counter()</strong> {
  usleep(1);
  sem_wait(semaphore); // Return value should be checked.
  int32_t temp = *counter;
  usleep(1);
  temp++;
  usleep(1);
  *counter = temp;
  sem_post(semaphore); // Return value should be checked.
  usleep(1);
}</pre>
			<p class="packt_figref">Code Box 18-3 [ExtremeC_examples_chapter18_1.c]: The critical section where the shared counter is being incremented</p>
			<p class="normal">Comparing to <em class="italics">example 17.6</em>, in the function <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">inc_counter</code>, the functions <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">sem_wait</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">sem_post</code> are used to enter and exit the critical sections, respectively.</p>
			<p class="normal">In the following code box, you can see the function <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">main</code>. It is almost the same as <em class="italics">example 17.6</em> and we only see some changes in the initial and final parts, and that is in accordance with the addition of two new functions seen in <em class="italics">Code Box 18-2</em>:</p>
			<pre>int <strong class="highlight">main</strong>(int argc, char** argv) {
  // Parent process needs to initialize the shared resource
  init_shared_resource();
  // Parent process needs to initialize the control mechanism
  init_control_mechanism();
  ... as in the example 17.6 ...
  // Only parent process needs to shut down the shared resource
  // and the employed control mechanism
  if (pid) {
    shutdown_shared_resource();
    shutdown_control_mechanism();
  }
  return 0;
}</pre>

			<p class="packt_figref">Shell Box 18-1: Building in Linux and two successive runs of example 18.1</p>
			<p class="normal">Note that we need to link the above code with the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">pthread</code> library because we are using POSIX semaphores. We need also to link it with the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">rt</code> library in Linux in order to use the shared memories.</p>
			<p class="normal">The preceding output is clear. Sometimes<a id="_idIndexMarker1252"/> the child process gets the CPU first and increments the counter, and sometimes the parent process does so. There is no time when both enter the critical section, and therefore they satisfy the data integrity of the shared counter.</p>
			<p class="normal">Note that it is not required to use the fork API in order to use named semaphores. Completely separated processes, which are not parent and child, can still open and use the same semaphores if they are run on the same machine and inside the same operating system. In <em class="italics">example 18.3</em>, we show how this is possible.</p>
			<p class="normal">As the final note in this section, you should know that we have two types of named semaphores in Unix-like operating systems. One is <em class="italics">System V Semaphores</em>, and the other is <em class="italics">POSIX semaphores</em>. In this section, we explained the POSIX semaphores because they have a better reputation for their nice API and performance. The following link is a Stack Overflow question which<a id="_idIndexMarker1253"/> nicely explains the differences between System V semaphores and POSI<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/368322/differences-between-system-v-and-posix-semaphores">X semaphores: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/368322/differences-between-system-v-and-po</a>six-semaphores.</p>

			<p class="normal">In the next section, we discuss named mutexes. In short, named mutexes are ordinary mutex objects that are put into a shared m<a id="_idTextAnchor468"/>emory region.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-244" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor469"/>Named mutexes</h1>
			<p class="normal">POSIX mutexes work simply in multi-threaded programs; we demonstrated this in <em class="italics">Chapter 16</em>, <em class="italics">Thread Synchronization</em>. This <a id="_idIndexMarker1254"/>would not be the case with regard to multiple process environments, however. To have a mutex work among a number of processes, it would need to be defined within a place that is accessible to all of them.</p>
			<p class="normal">The best choice for a shared place such as this is a shared memory region. Therefore, to have a mutex that <a id="_idIndexMarker1255"/>works in a multi-process environment, it should be distributed in a shared memory region.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-245" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor470"/>The first example</h2>
			<p class="normal">The following example, <em class="italics">example 18.2</em>, is a clone of <em class="italics">example 18.1</em>, but it solves the potential race condition <a id="_idIndexMarker1256"/>using named mutexes instead of named semaphores. It also shows how to make a shared memory region and use it to store a shared mutex.</p>
			<p class="normal">Since each shared memory object has a global name, a mutex stored in a shared memory region can be considered <em class="italics">named</em> and can be accessed by other processes throughout the system.</p>
			<p class="normal">The following code box shows the declarations required for <em class="italics">example 18.2</em>. It shows what is needed for having a shared mutex:</p>
			<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define SHARED_MEM_SIZE 4
// Shared file descriptor used to refer to shared memory object

// memory object
int mutex_shm_fd = -1;
// The pointer to the shared counter
int32_t* counter = NULL;
// The pointer to shared mutex
pthread_mutex_t* mutex = NULL;</pre>
			<p class="packt_figref">Code Box 18-5 [ExtremeC_examples_chapter18_2.c]: The global declarations of example 18.2</p>
			<p class="normal">As you can see, we have declared:</p>

			<p class="normal">As part of the function <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">init_control_mechanism</code>, we have created a new shared memory object named <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">/mutex0</code>.

			<p class="normal">Following that, we<a id="_idIndexMarker1258"/> get a pointer to the shared memory region.

			<p class="normal">In the function <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">destroy_control_mechanism</code> we destroy the mutex object, and after that we close and <a id="_idIndexMarker1259"/>unlink its underlying shared memory region.

}</pre>
			<p class="packt_figref">Code Box 18-9 [ExtremeC_examples_chapter18_2.c]: The critical section now uses a named mutex to protect the shared counter</p>
			<p class="normal">Generally, as you see in the preceding code boxes, a few places are different from <em class="italics">example 18.1</em>, and we<a id="_idIndexMarker1260"/> have had to change only three functions greatly. For instance, the function <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">main</code> has not changed at all, and it is the same as in <em class="italics">example 18.1</em>. This is simply because we have used a different control mechanism in comparison to <em class="italics">example 18.1</em>, and the remaining logic is the same.</p>
			<p class="normal">As the final note about <em class="italics">Code Box 18-9</em>, in the function <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">inc_counter</code>, we have used the mutex object exactly as we did in a multi-threaded program. The API is the same, and it is designed in a way that mutexes can be used both in multi-threaded and multi-process environments using the same API. This is a great feature of POSIX mutexes because it enables us to use the same written code in both multi-threaded and multi-process environments when consuming these objects – while of course, the initialization and destruction can be different.</p>
			<p class="normal">The output of the preceding code is very similar to what we observed for <em class="italics">example 18.1</em>. While the shared counter is protected by a mutex in this example, it was being protected by a semaphore in the previous example. The semaphore used in the previous example was actually a binary semaphore, and as we have explained in <em class="italics">Chapter 16</em>, <em class="italics">Thread Synchronization</em>, a binary semaphore can mimic a mutex. Therefore, not much is new in <em class="italics">example 18.2</em>, apart from replacing the binary semaphore with a mutex.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-246" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor471"/>The second example</h2>
			<p class="normal">The named shared memories and<a id="_idIndexMarker1261"/> mutexes can be used throughout the system by any process. It is not mandatory to have a forked process to be able to use these objects. The following example, <em class="italics">example 18.3</em>, tries to show how we can use a shared mutex and a shared memory to simultaneously terminate a number of processes that are all running at the same time. We expect to have all processes terminated after pressing the key combination <kbd class="Key--PACKT-">Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd class="Key--PACKT-">C</kbd> in only one of them.</p>
			<p class="normal">Note that the code is going to be provided in multiple steps. The comments related to each step are provided right after it. Let's present the first step.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-247" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor472"/>Step 1 – Global declarations</h3>
			<p class="normal">In this example, we write a single <a id="_idIndexMarker1262"/>source file that can be compiled and executed multiple times to create multiple processes. The processes use some shared memory regions to synchronize their execution. One of the processes is elected to be the owner of the shared memory regions and manages their creation and destruction. Other processes just use the created shared memories.</p>
			<p class="normal">The first step is going to declare some global objects that we need throughout the code. We will initialize them later on in the code. Note that the global variables defined in the following code box, such as <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">mutex</code>, are not actually shared between the processes. They have these variables in their own memory space but each of the processes maps their own global variable to the objects or variables located in the various shared memory regions:</p>

#include &lt;pthread.h&gt; // For using pthread_mutex_* functions
typedef uint16_t bool_t;
#define TRUE 1
#define FALSE 0
#define MUTEX_SHM_NAME "/mutex0"

// Shared file descriptor used to refer to the shared memory

// A flag which indicates whether the current process owns the

			<p class="normal">In the preceding code, we <a id="_idIndexMarker1263"/>can see the global declarations used in the code. We are going to use a shared flag to let the processes know about the cancellation signal. Note that, in this example, we are going to take the busy-wait approach to wait for the cancellation flag to become <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">true</code>.</p>
			<p class="normal">We have a dedicated shared memory object for the cancellation flag and another shared memory object for the mutex protecting the flag as we did in <em class="italics">example 18.2</em>. Note that we could construct a single structure and define both the cancellation flag and the mutex object as its fields, and then use a single shared memory region to store them. But we have chosen to use separate shared memory regions to fulfill our purpose.</p>
			<p class="normal">In this example, one important note about the shared memory objects is that the cleanup should be performed by the process which has created and initialized them in the first place. Since all processes are using the same code, somehow, we need to know which process has created a certain shared memory object and make that process the owner of that object. Then, while cleaning up the objects, only the owner process can proceed and do the actual cleanup. Therefore, we had to declare two Boolean variables for this purpose: <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">mutex_owner</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">cancel_flag_shm_owner</code>.</p>

			<p class="packt_figref">Code Box 18-11 [ExtremeC_examples_chapter18_3.c]: Initialization of the cancellation flag's shared memory</p>
			<p class="normal">The approach we took is different from what we did in <em class="italics">example 18.2</em>. That's because whenever a new <a id="_idIndexMarker1266"/>process is run, it should check whether the shared memory object has already been created by another process. Note<a id="_idIndexMarker1267"/> that we are not using the fork API to create new processes as part of this example and the user can use their shell and start a new process at will.</p>
			<p class="normal">For this reason, a new process first tries to open the shared memory region by only providing the flag <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">O_RDWR</code>. If it succeeds, then it's a sign that the current process is not the owner of that region, and it proceeds with mapping the shared memory region. If it fails, it means that the shared memory region does not exist, and it is an indication that the current process should create the region and becomes its owner. So, it proceeds and tries to open the region with different flags; <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">O_CREAT</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">O_EXCL</code>. These flags create a shared memory object if it does not exist.</p>
			<p class="normal">If the creation succeeds, the current process is the owner, and it continues by truncating and mapping the shared memory region.</p>
			<p class="normal">There is a small chance that between the two successive calls of the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">shm_open</code> function in the previous scenario, another process creates the same shared memory region, and therefore the second <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">shm_open</code> fails. The flag <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">O_EXCL</code> prevents the current process from creating an object which already exists, and then it quits by showing a proper error message. If this happens, which should be very rare, we can always try to run the process again and it won't face the same issue in the second run.</p>

			<p class="normal">As you see, the logic inside the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">main</code> function is clear and straightforward.

			<p class="normal">One thing which is <a id="_idIndexMarker1277"/>new here is the usage of the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">signal</code> function which assigns a signal handler to a specific set of <em class="italics">signals</em>. Signals are one of the facilities provided by all POSIX-compliant operating systems and using it, the processes within the system can send signals to each other. The <em class="italics">terminal</em> is just one <a id="_idIndexMarker1278"/>normal process that the user interacts with and it can be used to send signals to other processes. Pressing <kbd class="Key--PACKT-">Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd class="Key--PACKT-">C</kbd> is one convenient way to send <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">SIGINT</code> to the foreground process running in a terminal.</p>
			<p class="normal"><code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">SIGINT</code> is the <em class="italics">interrupt signal</em> which<a id="_idIndexMarker1279"/> can be received by a process. In the preceding code, we assign the function <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">sigint_handler</code> to be the handler of the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">SIGINT</code> signal. In other words, whenever the signal <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">SIGINT</code> is received by the process, the function <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">sigint_handler</code> will be called. If the signal <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">SIGINT</code> is not handled, the default routine is to terminate the process, but this can be overridden using signal handlers like above.</p>

			<p class="normal">In the next section, we demonstrate how to use condition variables. Like named mutexes, if you place a condition variable inside a shared memory region, it can be accessed and used by multipl<a id="_idTextAnchor477"/>e processes using the shared memory's name.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-252" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor478"/>Named condition variables</h1>
			<p class="normal">As we explained before, similar<a id="_idIndexMarker1284"/> to named POSIX mutexes, we need to allocate a POSIX condition variable from a shared memory region in order to use it in a multi-processing system. The following example, <em class="italics">example 18.4</em>, shows how to do so in order to make a number of processes count in a specific order. As you know from <em class="italics">Chapter 16</em>, <em class="italics">Thread Synchronization</em>, every condition variable should be used together with a companion mutex object which protects it. Therefore, we will have three shared memory regions in <em class="italics">example 18.4</em>; one for the shared counter, one for the shared <em class="italics">named condition variable</em>, and one for the shared <em class="italics">named mutex</em> protecting the shared condition variable.</p>
			<p class="normal">Note that instead of having three different shared memories, we could also use a single shared memory. This is possible by defining a structure that encompasses all the required objects. In this example, we are not going to take this approach and we will define a separate shared memory region for each object.</p>
			<p class="normal"><em class="italics">Example 18.4</em> is about a number of processes which should count in an ascending order. Each process is given a number, starting from 1 and up to the number of processes, and the given number indicates the process's rank within the other processes. The process must wait for the other processes with smaller numbers (ranks) to count first and then it can count its turn and exit. Of course, the process assigned the number 1 counts first, even if it is the latest spawned process.</p>
			<p class="normal">Since we are going to have three different shared memory regions, each of which requiring its own steps to get initialized and finalized, we would have a lot of code duplication if we wanted to take the same approach as we have so far in the previous examples. For reducing the amount of code that we write, and factoring out the duplications into some functions, and having a better-organized code, we are going to make it object-oriented according to the topics and procedures discussed in <em class="italics">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italics">OOP and Encapsulation</em>, <em class="italics">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italics">Composition and Aggregation</em>, and <em class="italics">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="italics">Inheritance and Polymorphism</em>. We are going to write <em class="italics">example 18.4</em> in an object-oriented manner and use inheritance to reduce the amount of duplicated code.</p>
			<p class="normal">We will define a parent class for all classes which need to be built upon a shared memory region. Therefore, while having the parent shared memory class, there will be one child class defined for the shared counter, one child class for the shared named mutex, and another child class for the shared named condition variable. Each class will have its own pair of header and source files, and all of them will be used finally in the main function of the example.</p>
			<p class="normal">The following sections go through the mentioned classes one by one. First of all, let's being with the parent class: shared memory.</p>

			<p class="normal">When this happens, the process prints its number, increments the shared counter, and by broadcasting a signal on the shared condition variable object, it notifies the rest of the waiting processes about the modification which it has made to the shared counter.

			<p class="normal">Since the first<a id="_idIndexMarker1303"/> process is the owner of all shared memories, it should delete them upon exiting. Releasing the allocated resources in a multi-processing environment can be quite tricky and complex because a simple mistake is enough to cause all the processes to crash.

			<p class="normal">Suppose that, in the preceding example, we'd run the first process with the number 2 and the second process with the number 3.

			<p class="normal">This is just a simple example of how finalization can be tricky and problematic in multi-process systems. In order to mitigate the risk of such crashes, one needs to introduce further synchronization among processes.</p>
			<p class="normal">During the previous sections, we covered the mechanisms which can be employed to synchronize a number of processes while all of them are running on the same host. In the following <a id="_idIndexMarker1304"/>section, we are going to briefly talk about distributed concurrency control mechanisms and their features.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-258" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor484"/>Distributed concurrency control</h1>
			<p class="normal">So far in this chapter we have<a id="_idIndexMarker1305"/> assumed that all processes exist within the same operating system, and hence the same machine. In other words, we were constantly talking about a single-host software system.</p>
			<p class="normal">But real software systems usually go beyond that. Conversely to the single-host software system, we have distributed software systems. These systems have processes distributed throughout a network, and they function through communicating over the network.</p>
			<p class="normal">Regarding a distributed<a id="_idIndexMarker1306"/> system of processes, we can see more challenges in some aspects that are not present in a centralized or single-host system in that degree. Next, we discuss some of them briefly:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="list"><strong class="bold">In a distributed software system, you are probably experiencing parallelism instead of concurrency</strong>. Since each process runs on a separate machine, and each process has its own specific processor, we will be observing parallelism instead of concurrency. Concurrency is usually limited to the borders of a single machine. Note that interleavings still exist and we might experience the same non-determinism as we saw in concurrent systems.</li>
				<li class="list"><strong class="bold">Not all processes within a distributed software system are written using a single programming language</strong>. It is pretty common to see various programming languages being used in a distributed software system. It is also common to see the same diversity in the processes of a single-host software system. Despite our implicit assumption about the processes within a system, which is that all of them have been written using C, we can have processes written using any other language. Different languages provide different ways of having concurrency and control mechanisms. Therefore, for example, in some languages, you may not be able to use a named mutex very easily. Diverse technologies and programming languages used in a software system, single-host or distributed, force us to use concurrency control mechanisms that are abstract enough to be available in all of them. This might limit us to using a specific synchronization technique which is available in a certain technology or a programming language.</li>
				<li class="list"><strong class="bold">In a distributed system, you always have a network as the communication channel between two processes not residing on the same machine</strong>. This is converse to our implicit assumption about the single-host system where all processes are running within the same operating system and using the available messaging infrastructures to communicate with each other.</li>
				<li class="list"><strong class="bold">Having a network in the middle means that you have latency</strong>. There is a slight latency in single-host systems as well, but it is determined and manageable. It is also much lower than the latency you might experience in a network. Latency simply means that a process may not receive a message immediately because of many reasons having roots in the networking infrastructure. Nothing should be considered immediate in these systems.</li>
				<li class="list"><strong class="bold">Having a network in the middle also results in security issues</strong>. When you have all the processes in one system, and all of them are communicating within the<a id="_idIndexMarker1307"/> same boundary using mechanisms with extremely low latency, the security issues are greatly different. One has to firstly access the system itself in order to attack the system, but in a distributed system, all message passing is being done through the network. You might get an <em class="italics">eavesdropper</em> in the middle to sniff or, even worse, alter the messages. Regarding our discussion about synchronization in distributed systems, this is also applicable to messages meant to synchronize the processes within a distributed system.</li>
				<li class="list"><strong class="bold">Other than latency and security issues, you might have delivery issues that happen far less frequently in single-host multi-process systems</strong>. Messages should be delivered to be processed. When a process sends a message to another process within the system, somehow the sender process should make sure that its message is received by the other end. <em class="italics">Delivery guarantee</em> mechanisms are possible, but they're costly and, in some scenarios, it is just not possible to use them at all. In those situations, a special kind of messaging problem is seen, which is usually modeled by the famous <em class="italics">Two Generals Problem</em>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">The preceding differences and possible issues are enough to force us to invent new ways of synchronization among processes and various components of giant distributed systems. Generally, there are two ways to make a distributed system transactional and synchronized:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="list"><strong class="bold">Centralized process synchronization</strong>: These techniques need a central process (or node) that manages<a id="_idIndexMarker1308"/> the processes. All the other processes within the system should be in constant communication with this central node, and they need its approval in order to enter their critical sections.</li>
				<li class="list"><strong class="bold">Distributed (or peer-to-peer) process synchronization</strong>: Having a process synchronization infrastructure<a id="_idIndexMarker1309"/> that does not have a central node is not an easy task. This is actual<a id="_idTextAnchor485"/>ly an active field of research, and there are some ad hoc algorithms.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">In this section, we tried to shine a little light over the complexity of concurrency control in a distributed multi-process system. Further discussions about distributed concurrency control would be out of the scope of this book.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-259" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor486"/>Summary</h1>
			<p class="normal">In this chapter, we completed our discussion regarding multi-processing environments. As part of this chapter, we discussed the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="list">What a named semaphore is and how it can be created and used by multiple processes.</li>
				<li class="list">What a named mutex is and how it should be used using a shared memory region.</li>
				<li class="list">We gave an example which was about termination orchestration in which a number of processes were waiting for a sign to get terminated and the signal was received and handled by one of the processes and propagated to others. We implemented this example using shared mutexes.</li>
				<li class="list">What a named condition variable is and how it can become shared and named using a shared memory region.</li>
				<li class="list">We demonstrated another example of counting processes. As part of this example, we used inheritance to reduce the amount of code duplication for mutex and condition variable objects having an associated shared memory region.</li>
				<li class="list">We briefly explored the differences and challenges found in a distributed system.</li>
				<li class="list">We briefly discussed the methods which can be employed to bring concurrency control into distributed software.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">In the upcoming chapter, we start our discussions regarding <strong class="bold">Inter-Process Communication</strong> (<strong class="bold">IPC</strong>) techniques. Our discussions will span two chapters and we will cover many topics such as computer networks, transport protocols, socket programming, and many more useful topics.</p>
