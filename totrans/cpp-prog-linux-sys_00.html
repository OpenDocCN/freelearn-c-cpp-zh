<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
<p>Greetings, dear reader! You are among friends. Welcome to this journey of advanced skills, unexpected surprises, cunning knowledge, and novel programming tools. Suppose you are an experienced software engineer who knows how to write quality code and is aware of some build and operating systems. You have also met several computer architectures and fixed one or two bugs. And how about the following: You are a student who just learns how to do the job of a software engineer. You want to be a good professional someday. And you want to be the expert, whom others call, whenever the software behaves unpredictably. Or you just have picked up this book out of initial interest, still not knowing what to expect. <span class="No-Break">Then perfect!</span></p>
<p>We challenge you to remember any situations in your practice, where, to this day, you have no explanation of what happened. No, we do not mean the supernatural – although this topic is rather arcane. We speak about the system and how we conduct its behavior as professional engineers. Our code is just an instrument that tells the machine what to do. So, let’s say you have remembered that one bug that has been bugging you for some time – how do you proceed? What if it stands between you and your next promotion? How about when it disappoints a client that is important to you? Or you just want to impress your teacher. We get you! We are <span class="No-Break">there, too.</span></p>
<p>Do not be fooled, though. We give you the opportunity to enrich the way you engineer through some fundamental pointers, but we do not have all the answers. We strongly believe that changing the way you see how code works will make you a more robust expert, no matter your professional field. And you should care because the world of technology is rapidly advancing. It is impossible to keep up with every innovation, algorithm, language, operating system, and architecture. But you could start asking yourself the right questions at the right moment. You have the possibility to know how to optimize further, design better, validate your environment, and encourage yourself to understand your own <span class="No-Break">work thoroughly.</span></p>
<p>We challenge you again. This time to be more self-aware and efficient through our experience and expertise. There are some sophisticated real-world challenges that we so impatiently want to share with you. Please remember, it will take you some time. As friends, we hope you enjoy this book and share the exciting parts with others. Chop-chop... <span class="No-Break">Let’s go!</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is for programmers and developers who want to boost their programming knowledge in C++ for Linux and Unix-based operating systems. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn how to use C++ in such an environment or an experienced programmer looking to explore the latest C++20 features applicable to system programming, you’ll find this <span class="No-Break">book helpful.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
<p><a href="B20833_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Getting Started with the Linux Systems and the POSIX Standard</em>, introduces the reader to the reasoning behind the existence of different operating systems. The Linux specifics are discussed, and the reader proceeds to the fundamentals of Unix-based OS programming. The kernel space and user spaces are mentioned as the System Call Interface is explained thoroughly. Afterward, we use this opportunity to present POSIX and some standard function calls in order to let the reader grasp the benefits of the <span class="No-Break">system programming.</span></p>
<p><a href="B20833_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor029"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Learning More about Process Management</em>, expands on learnings from the previous chapter and states that if the operating system is the main resource manager, then the process is the main resource user. It does so through a routine, which could get complex and needs to be well analyzed. Therefore, the chapter goes through the main process’s life cycle - its startup, running, and final states. The nature of the thread is presented as well. We go through the OS’s scheduling algorithms as well. A sample C++ application is introduced and its <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function is discussed as an entry point. In addition, different ways to initiate a process are presented: <strong class="source-inline">fork()</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">vfork()</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">exec()</strong>. Other fundamental functions such as <strong class="source-inline">wait()</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">exit()</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">pthread_create()</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">pthread_join()</strong> are discussed <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></p>
<p><a href="B20833_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor047"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Navigating through the Filesystems</em>, shows how the file is the basic resource representation in Linux - both for data and access to I/O devices. This abstraction allows the user to manipulate streams or store data in the same manner, through the same system interfaces. The file system structure - metadata and inodes, is discussed. Examples of C++ file system operations are presented to the reader. We use this opportunity to introduce the pipes as an initial instrument for inter-process communication. The <strong class="source-inline">string_view</strong> C++20 object is offered as well. At the end, we mention signal handling as it will be required for <span class="No-Break">later chapters.</span></p>
<p><a href="B20833_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor060"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Diving Deep into the C++ Object</em>, guides the reader through some core C++ features like the process of object creation and its initialization. We discuss lifetime object problems, temporaries, RVO, RAII pattern, and C++20. We also cover function objects and lambda expressions together with their specifics and guidance on how to use them. Next, we will get deeper into lambdas. In the end, we will focus on some specific examples of how to use lambdas in STL <span class="No-Break">and multithreading.</span></p>
<p><a href="B20833_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor075"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Handling Errors with C++</em>, explores the different kinds of error reporting in C++ programming for Unix-based operating systems, such as error codes, exceptions, and asserts. We will discuss the best practices in exception handling and exception manipulation and what happens with uncaught exceptions in the system. We will discuss the exception specifications and why we prefer the <strong class="source-inline">noexcept</strong> keyword. We will go through the performance impact when using exceptions and the mechanics behind them. Next, we will discuss how we can use <strong class="source-inline">std::optional</strong> to handle errors. At the end, we will discuss what <strong class="source-inline">std::uncaught_exceptions</strong> <span class="No-Break">functionality provides.</span></p>
<p><a href="B20833_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor086"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Concurrent System Programming with C++</em>, discusses the fundamentals and the theory behind processes and threads in Unix-based operating systems. We will go through the changes in the memory model of C++ in order to natively support concurrency. We will get acquainted with the C++ primitives which enable multithreading support - thread, jthread, and task. Next, we will learn how to synchronize the execution of parallel code using C++ synchronization primitives. We will also investigate what STL provides in the direction of parallel algorithms. In the end, we will learn how to write <span class="No-Break">lock-free code.</span></p>
<p><a href="B20833_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor101"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Proceeding with Inter-process Communication</em>, guides readers through the basic IPC mechanisms in the Linux environment (as they already have the impression of the multithreading’s challenges). It is important that the processes are able to communicate with each other easily, therefore, we go quickly through message queues. They allow the exchange of data without blocking processes. We will spend some time discussing synchronization mechanisms – semaphore and mutex- and then proceed with the shared memory. It provides quick access to some data and, at the same time, allows heterogeneous systems to have a common point for data exchange. At last, the sockets are frequently used, but mainly for their possibility to allow communication between computer systems on <span class="No-Break">the network.</span></p>
<p><a href="B20833_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor116"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Using Clocks, Timers, and Signals in Linux</em>, introduces the signals and timers in Unix-based operating systems. We will initially present how the signaling system works and how the user can effectively manage the time of operations. We will cover what C++ language provides as functionality to handle clocks and timers. We will introduce the standard time API, <strong class="source-inline">std::chrono</strong>, predefined clocks and times. Next, we will cover how to use them correctly and what to expect from them. Next, we will focus on the duration capabilities that the standard provides and user-defined clocks. Ultimately, we will cover the calendar and time zone libraries introduced <span class="No-Break">in C++20.</span></p>
<p><a href="B20833_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor129"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Understanding the C++ Memory Model</em>, explores some new C++20 features. It guides the reader through some crucial remarks on how and why to manage dynamic resources. It proceeds with a discussion on the conditional variables and mutex usages, as well as lazy initialization and cache friendliness. An introduction to the C++ memory order follows as we discuss ways to choose from different synchronization mechanisms. The spinlock/ticketlock techniques are <span class="No-Break">also presented.</span></p>
<p><a href="B20833_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor147"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Using Coroutines in C++ for System Programming</em>, talks about coroutines, an already existing term with implementations in some programming languages, but now they are introduced in C++20. They are described as stackless functions suspended during execution and resumed later. The chapter discusses those exact valuable features in the area of system programming. Their disadvantages are also discussed, for example, keeping the suspended coroutine state on the heap. Some practical usages <span class="No-Break">are presented.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
<p>Some familiarity with the basics of the C++ language and POSIX programming in C language is required before starting with this book. Prior knowledge of the fundamentals of Linux and Unix will be helpful but <span class="No-Break">not necessary.</span></p>
