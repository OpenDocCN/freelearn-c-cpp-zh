			<h1 id="_idParaDest-308" class="chapterTitle" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor597"/>Integration with Other Languages</h1>
			<p class="normal">Knowing how to write a C program or library can be more valuable than you might expect. Due to the important role of C in developing operating systems, C is not limited to its own world. C libraries have the potential to be loaded and used in other programming languages as well. While you are reaping the be<a id="_idTextAnchor598"/>nefits of writing code in a higher-level programming language, you can have the rocket power of C as a loaded library inside your language environment.</p>
			<p class="normal">In this chapter we are going to talk more about this, and demonstrate how C shared libraries can be integrated with some well-known programming languages.</p>
			<p class="normal">In this chapter, we will cover the following key topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="list">We discuss why integration is possible in the first place. The discussion is important because it gives you the basic idea of how integration works.</li>
				<li class="list">We design a C stack library. We build it as a shared object file. This shared object file is going to be used by a number of other programming languages.</li>
				<li class="list">We go through C++, Java, Python, and Golang and see how the stack library can be loaded first and then used.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">As a general note in this chapter, since we are going to work on five different subprojects, each having different programming languages, we only present the builds for Linux in order to prevent any issues regarding the builds and executions. Of course, we give enough information about the macOS system, but our focus is to build and run sources on Linux. Further scripts are available in the book's GitHub repository that help you to build the sources for macOS.</p>
			<p class="normal">The first section talks about the integration itself. We see why the integration with other programming languages is possible and it makes a basis for expanding our discussion within other environments rather than C.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-309" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor599"/>Why integration is possible?</h1>
			<p class="normal">As we have explained in <em class="italics">Chapter 10</em>, <em class="italics">Unix – History and Architecture</em>, C revolutionized the way we were developing operating systems. That's not the only magic of C; it also gave us the power to build other <a id="_idIndexMarker1560"/>general-purpose programming languages on top of it. Nowadays, we call them higher-level programming languages. The compilers of these languages are mostly written in C and if not, they've been developed by other tools and compilers written in C.</p>
			<p class="normal">A general-purpose programming language that is not able to use or provide the functionalities of a system is not doing anything at all. You can write things with it, but you cannot execute it on any system. While there could be usages for such a programming language from a theoretical point of view, certainly it is not plausible from an industrial point of view. Therefore, the programming language, especially through its compiler, should be able to produce programs that work. As you know, the functionalities of a system are exposed through the operating system. Regardless of the operating system itself, a programming language should be able to provide those functionalities, and the programs written in that language, and being run on that system, should be able to use them.</p>
			<p class="normal">This is where C comes in. In Unix-like operating systems, the C standard library provides the API to use the available functionalities of the system. If a compiler wants to create a working program, it should be able to allow the compiled program to use the C standard library in an indirect fashion. No matter what the programming language is and whether it offers some specific and native standard library, like<a id="_idIndexMarker1561"/> Java, which offers <strong class="bold">Java Standard Edition</strong> (<strong class="bold">Java SE</strong>), any request for a specific functionality made by the written program (such as opening a file) should be passed down to the C standard library and from there, it can reach the kernel and get performed.</p>
			<p class="normal">As an example, let's talk a bit more about Java. Java<a id="_idIndexMarker1562"/> programs are compiled to an intermediate language called <em class="italics">bytecode</em>. In order to execute a Java bytecode, one needs to have <strong class="bold">Java Runtime Environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">JRE</strong>) installed. JRE has<a id="_idIndexMarker1563"/> a virtual machine at its heart that loads the Java bytecode and runs it within itself. This virtual machine must be able to simulate the functionalities and services exposed by the C standard library and provide them to the program running within. Since every platform can be different in terms of the C standard library and its compliance with POSIX and SUS standards, we need to have some virtual machines built specifically for each platform.</p>
			<p class="normal">As a final note about the libraries that can be loaded in other languages, we can only load shared object files <a id="_idIndexMarker1564"/>and it is not possible to load and use static libraries. Static libraries can only be linked to an executable or a shared object file. Shared object files have the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.so</code> extension in most Unix-like systems but they have the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.dylib</code> extension in macOS.</p>
			<p class="normal">In this section, despite its short length, I tried to give you a basic idea of why we are able to load C libraries, shared libraries specifically, and how most programming languages are already using C libraries, since the ability to load a shared object library and use it exists in most of them.</p>
			<p class="normal">The next step would be writing a C library and then loading it in various programming languages in order to use it. That's exactly what we want to do soon but before that you need to know how to get the chapter material and how to run the commands seen in the shell boxes.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-310" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor600"/>Obtaining the necessary materials</h1>
			<p class="normal">Since this chapter is<a id="_idIndexMarker1565"/> full of sources from five different programming languages, and my hope is to have you all able to build and run the examples, I dedicated this section to going through some basic notes that you should be aware of regarding building the source code.</p>
			<p class="normal">First of all, you need to obtain the chapter material. As you should know by now, the book has a repository in which this chapter has a specific directory named <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">ch21-integration-with-other-languages</code>. The following commands show you how to clone the repository and change to the chapter's root directory:</p>
			<pre><strong class="highlight">$ git clone https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Extreme-C.git</strong>
<strong class="highlight">...</strong>
<strong class="highlight">$ cd Extreme-C/ch21-integration-with-other-languages</strong>
<strong class="highlight">$</strong></pre>
			<p class="packt_figref">Shell Code 21-1: Cloning the book's GitHub repository and changing to the chapter's root directory</p>
			<p class="normal">Regarding the shell boxes in this chapter, we assume that before executing the commands in a shell box, we are located in the root of the chapter, in the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">ch21-integration-with-other-languages</code> folder. If we needed to change to other directories, we provide the required commands for that, but everything is happening inside the chapter's directory.</p>
			<p class="normal">In addition, in order to be able to build source code, you need to have <strong class="bold">Java Development Kit</strong> (<strong class="bold">JDK</strong>), Python, and Golang installed on your machine. Depending on whether you're using Linux or macOS, and on your Linux distribution, the installation commands can be different.</p>
			<p class="normal">As the final note, the <a id="_idIndexMarker1566"/>source code written in other languages than C should be able to use the C stack library that we discuss in the upcoming section. Building those sources requires that you've already built the C library. Therefore, make sure that you read the following section first and have its shared object library built before moving on to the next sections. Now that you know how to obtain the chapter's material, we can proceed to discuss our target C li<a id="_idTextAnchor601"/>brary.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-311" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor602"/>Stack library</h1>
			<p class="normal">In this section, we are going to write a small library that is going to be loaded and used by programs written<a id="_idIndexMarker1567"/> in other programming languages. The library is about a Stack class that offers some basic operations like <em class="italics">push</em> or <em class="italics">pop</em> on stack objects. Stack objects are created and destroyed by the library itself and there is a constructor function, as well as a destructor function, to fulfill this purpose.</p>
			<p class="normal">Next, you can find the library's public interface, which exists as part of the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">cstack.h</code> header file:</p>
			<pre>#ifndef _CSTACK_H_
#define _CSTACK_H_

			<p class="packt_figref">Code Box 21-1 [cstack.h]: The public interface of the Stack library</p>
			<p class="normal">As we have explained in <em class="italics">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italics">OOP and Encapsulation</em>, the preceding declarations introduce the<a id="_idIndexMarker1568"/> public interface of the Stack class. As you see, the companion attribute structure of the class is <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">cstack_t</code>. We have used <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">cstack_t</code> instead of <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">stack_t</code> because the latter is used in the C standard library and I prefer to avoid any ambiguity in this code. By the preceding declarations, the attribute structure is forward declared and has no fields in it. Instead, the details will come in the source file that does the actual implementation. The class also has a constructor, a destructor, and some other behaviors such as push and pop. As you can see, all of them accept a pointer of type <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">cstack_t</code> as their first argument that indicates the object they should act on. The way we wrote the Stack class is explained as part of <em class="italics">implicit encapsulation</em> in <em class="italics">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italics">OOP and Encapsulation</em>.</p>
			<p class="normal"><em class="italics">Code Box 21-2</em> contains the implementation of the stack class. It also contains the actual definition for the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">cstack_t</code> attribute <a id="_idIndexMarker1569"/>structure:</p>

			<p class="packt_figref">Code Box 21-2 [cstack.c]: The definition of the stack class</p>
			<p class="normal">As you see, the definition implies that every stack object is backed with an array, and more than that, we can store any value in the stack. Let's build the library and produce a shared object library <a id="_idIndexMarker1570"/>out of it. This would be the library file that is going to be loaded by other programming languages in the upcoming sections.</p>
			<p class="normal">The following shell box shows how to create a shared object library using the existing source files. The commands found in the text box work in Linux and they should be slightly changed in order to work in macOS. Note that before running the build commands, you should be in this chapter's root directory as explained before:</p>

			<p class="packt_figref">Shell Box 21-2: Building the stack library and producing the shared object library file in Linux</p>
			<p class="normal">As a side note, in macOS, we can run the preceding exact commands if the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">gcc</code> is a known command and it is pointing to the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">clang</code> compiler.

			<p class="normal">In the following chapter, we will cover unit testing in C. As a proper replacement for the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">assert</code> statements seen in <em class="italics">Code Box 21-3</em>, we could write unit tests and use a unit testing framework like CMocka to execute them.</p>
			<p class="normal">In the following sections, we are going to integrate the stack library in programs written by four programming<a id="_idIndexMarker1573"/> languages. We'll st<a id="_idTextAnchor603"/>art with C++.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-312" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor604"/>Integration with C++</h1>
			<p class="normal">Integration with<a id="_idIndexMarker1574"/> C++ can be assumed as the easiest. C++ can be thought of as an object-oriented extension to C. A C++ compiler produces similar object files to those that a C compiler produces. Therefore, a C++ program can load and use a C shared object library easier than any other programming language. In other words, it doesn't matter whether a shared object file is the output of a C or C++ project; both can be consumed by a C++ program. The only thing that can be problematic in some cases is the C++ <em class="italics">name mangling</em> feature that is described in <em class="italics">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italics">Compilation and Linking</em>. As a reminder, we'll briefly review it in the following section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-313" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor605"/>Name mangling in C++</h2>
			<p class="normal">To elaborate <a id="_idIndexMarker1575"/>more on this, we should say that symbol names corresponding to functions (both global and member functions in classes) are mangled in C++. Name mangling is mainly there to support <em class="italics">namespaces</em> and <em class="italics">function overloading</em>, which are missing in C. Name mangling is enabled by default, therefore if C code gets compiled using a C++ compiler, we expect to see mangled symbol names. Look at the following example in <em class="italics">Code Box 21-4</em>:</p>
			<pre>int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}</pre>
			<p class="packt_figref">Code Box 21-4 [test.c]: A simple function in C</p>
			<p class="normal">If we compile the preceding file using a C compiler, in this case <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">clang</code>, we see the following symbols in the generated object file, shown in <em class="italics">Shell Box 21-6</em>. Note that the file <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">test.c</code> doesn't exist in the book's GitHub repository:</p>

			<p class="packt_figref">Shell Box 21-6: Compiling test.c with a C compiler</p>
			<p class="normal">As you see, we have a symbol named <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">_add</code> that refers to the function <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">add</code> defined above. Now, let's compile the file with a C++ compiler, in this case <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">clang++</code>:</p>
			<pre><strong class="highlight">$ clang++ -c test.c -o test.o</strong>

			<p class="packt_figref">Shell Box 21-7: Compiling test.c with a C++ compiler</p>
			<p class="normal">As you can see, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">clang++</code> has generated a warning that says that in the near future, the support for compiling <a id="_idIndexMarker1576"/>C code as C++ code will be dropped. But since this behavior is not removed yet (and it is just deprecated), we see that the symbol name generated for the preceding function is mangled and is different from the one generated by <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">clang</code>. This can definitely lead to problems in the linking phase when looking for a specific symbol.</p>
			<p class="normal">To eliminate this issue, one needs to wrap the C code inside a special scope that prevents a C++ compiler from mangling the symbol names. Then, compiling it with <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">clang</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">clang++</code> produces the same symbol names. Look at the following code in <em class="italics">Code Box 21-5,</em> which is a changed version of the code introduced in <em class="italics">Code Box 21-4</em>:</p>
			<pre>#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

  return a + b;
}
#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif</pre>
			<p class="packt_figref">Code Box 21-5 [test.c]: Putting the function declaration into the special C scope</p>
			<p class="normal">The preceding function is put in the scope <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">extern "C" { ... }</code> only if the macro <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">__cplusplus</code> is already defined. Having the macro <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">__cplusplus</code> is a sign that the code is being compiled by a C++ compiler. Let's compile the preceding code with <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">clang++</code> again:</p>
			<pre><strong class="highlight">$ clang++ -c test.c -o test.o</strong>

			<p class="packt_figref">Shell Box 21-8: Compiling the new version of test.c with clang++</p>
			<p class="normal">As you see, the generated symbol is not mangled anymore. Regarding our stack library, based on what we <a id="_idIndexMarker1577"/>explained so far, we need to put all declarations in the scope <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">extern "C" { … }</code> and this is exactly the reason behind having that scope in <em class="italics">Code Box 21-1</em>.

It is more appropriate to expose the stack functionality in an object-oriented fashion instead of having the stack library's C functions be called directly.</p>

			<p class="packt_figref">Code Box 21-6 [c++/Stack.cpp]: A C++ class that wraps the functionalities exposed by the stack library</p>
			<p class="normal">Regarding the preceding<a id="_idIndexMarker1581"/> class, we can point out the following important notes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="list">The preceding class keeps a private pointer to a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">cstack_t</code> variable. This pointer addresses the object created by the static library's <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">cstack_new</code> function. This pointer can be thought of as a <em class="italics">handle</em> to an object that exists at the C level, created and managed by a separate C library. The pointer <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">mStack</code> is analogous to a file descriptor (or file handle) that refers to a file.</li>
				<li class="list">The class wraps all behavior functions exposed by the stack library. This is not essentially true for any object-oriented wrapper around a C library, and usually a limited set of functionalities is exposed.</li>
				<li class="list">The preceding class is a template class. This means that it can operate on a variety of data types. As you can see, we have declared two template functions for serializing and deserializing objects with various types: <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">CreateValue</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">ExtractValue</code>. The preceding class uses these functions to create a byte array from a C++ object (serialization) and to create a C++ object from a byte array (deserialization) respectively.</li>
				<li class="list">We define a specialized template function for the type <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">std::string</code>. Therefore, we can use the preceding class to store values with the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">std::string</code> type. Note that <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">std::string</code> is the standard type in C++ for having a string variable.</li>
				<li class="list">As part of the stack library, you can have multiple values from different types pushed into a single stack instance. The value can be converted to/from a character array. Look at the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">value_t</code> structure in <em class="italics">Code Box 21-1</em>. It only needs a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">char</code> pointer and that's all. Unlike the stack library, the preceding C++ class is <em class="italics">type-safe</em> and every instance of it can operate only on a specific data type.</li>
				<li class="list">In C++, every class has at least one constructor and one destructor. Therefore, it would be easy to initialize the underlying stack object as part of the constructor and finalize it in the destructor. That's exactly what you see in the preceding code.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">We want our C++ class to be able to operate on string values. Therefore, we need to write proper serializer <a id="_idIndexMarker1582"/>and deserializer functions that can be used within the class. The following code contains the function definitions that convert a C char array to an <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">std::string</code> object and vice versa:</p>
			<pre>template&lt;&gt;
value_t CreateValue(const std::string&amp; pValue) {
  value_t value;
  value.len = pValue.size() + 1;
  value.data = new char[value.len];
  strcpy(value.data, pValue.c_str());
  return value;
}
template&lt;&gt;
std::string ExtractValue(const value_t&amp; value) {
  return std::string(value.data, value.len);
}</pre>

In the next section, we are going to briefly talk about the Java programming language and the way that we are going to load our C library in a<a id="_idTextAnchor607"/> program written in Java.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-315" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor608"/>Integration with Java</h1>
			<p class="normal">Java programs are<a id="_idIndexMarker1586"/> compiled by a Java compiler into Java bytecode. Java bytecode is analogous to the object file format specified in the <strong class="bold">Application Binary Interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">ABI</strong>).

			<p class="normal">Java bytecode can only be run within a <strong class="bold">Java Virtual Machine</strong> (<strong class="bold">JVM</strong>).

			<div><div><p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">The Java programming<a id="_idIndexMarker1587"/> language is not the only language that can be compiled into Java bytecode.

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal">In this section, we are going to load our already built stack library into a Java program. For those who have no prior knowledge of Java, the steps we take may seem complicated and hard to grasp. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that readers come into this section with some basic knowle<a id="_idTextAnchor609"/>dge about Java programming.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-316" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor610"/>Writing the Java part</h2>
			<p class="normal">Suppose that we have a C project that it is <a id="_idIndexMarker1588"/>built into a shared object library. We want to bring it into Java and use its functions. Fortunately, we can write and compile the Java part without having any C (or native) code. They are well separated by the <em class="italics">native methods</em> in Java. Obviously, you cannot run the Java program with just the Java part, and have the C functions called, without the shared object library file being loaded. We give the necessary steps and source code to make this happen and run a Java program that loads a shared object library and invokes its functions successfully.</p>
			<p class="normal">The JVM uses <strong class="bold">Java Native Interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">JNI</strong>) to load <a id="_idIndexMarker1589"/>shared object libraries. Note that JNI is not part of the Java programming language; rather, it is part of the JVM specification, therefore an imported shared object library can be used in all JVM languages such as Scala.</p>
			<p class="normal">In the following paragraphs, we show how to use JNI to load our target shared object library file.</p>
			<p class="normal">As we said before, JNI uses native methods. Native methods don't have any definition in Java; their actual definitions are written using C or C++ and they reside in external shared libraries. In other words, native methods are ports for the Java programs to communicate to the world outside of the JVM. The following code shows a class that contains a number of static native methods and it is supposed to expose the functionalities provided by our stack library:</p>
			<pre>package com.packt.extreme_c.ch21.ex1;
class NativeStack {
  static {
    System.loadLibrary("NativeStack");
  }
  public static native long newStack();
  public static native void deleteStack(long stackHandler);
  public static native void ctor(long stackHandler, int maxSize);
  public static native void dtor(long stackHandler);
  public static native int size(long stackHandler);
  public static native void push(long stackHandler, byte[] item);
  public static native byte[] pop(long stackHandler);
  public static native void clear(long stackHandler);
}</pre>
			<p class="packt_figref">Code Box 21-9 [java/src/com/packt/extreme_c/ch21/ex1/Main.java]: The NativeStack class</p>
			<p class="normal">As the method signatures imply, they correspond to the functions we have in the C stack library. Note that the first operand is a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">long</code> variable. It contains a native address read from the native library<a id="_idIndexMarker1590"/> and acts as a pointer that should be passed to other methods to denote the stack instance. Note that, for writing the preceding class, we don't need to have a fully working shared object file beforehand. The only thing we need is the list of required declarations to define the stack API.</p>
			<p class="normal">The preceding class has also a <em class="italics">static constructor</em>. The <a id="_idIndexMarker1591"/>constructor loads a shared object library file located on the filesystem and tries to match the native methods with the symbols found in that shared object library. Note that the preceding shared object library is not <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">libcstack.so</code>. In other words, this is not the shared object file that we produced for our stack library. JNI has a very precise recipe for finding symbols that correspond to native methods. Therefore, we cannot use our symbols defined in <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">libcstack.so</code>; instead we need to create the symbols that JNI is looking for and then use our stack library from there.</p>
			<p class="normal">This might be a bit unclear at the moment, but in the following section, we clarify this and you'll see how this can be done. Let's continue with the Java part. We still need to add some more Java code.</p>
			<p class="normal">The following is a generic Java class named <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Stack&lt;T&gt;</code> that wraps the native methods exposed by JNI. Generic Java classes can be regarded as twin concepts for the template classes that we had in C++. They are used to specify some generic types that can operate on other types.</p>
			<p class="normal">As you see in the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Stack&lt;T&gt;</code> class, there is a <em class="italics">marshaller</em> object, from the type <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Marshaller&lt;T&gt;</code>, that is used to <a id="_idIndexMarker1592"/>serialize and deserialize the methods' input arguments (from type <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">T</code>) in order to put them into, or retrieve them from, the underlying C stack:</p>
			<pre>interface Marshaller&lt;T&gt; {
  byte[] marshal(T obj);
  T unmarshal(byte[] data);
}
class Stack&lt;T&gt; implements AutoCloseable {
  private Marshaller&lt;T&gt; marshaller;
  private long stackHandler;
  public Stack(Marshaller&lt;T&gt; marshaller) {
    this.marshaller = marshaller;
    this.stackHandler = NativeStack.newStack();
    NativeStack.ctor(stackHandler, 100);
  }
  @Override
  public void close() {
    NativeStack.dtor(stackHandler);
    NativeStack.deleteStack(stackHandler);
  }
  public int size() {
    return NativeStack.size(stackHandler);
  }
  public void push(T item) {
    NativeStack.push(stackHandler, marshaller.marshal(item));
  }
  public T pop() {
    return marshaller.unmarshal(NativeStack.pop(stackHandler));
  }
  public void clear() {
    NativeStack.clear(stackHandler);
  }
}</pre>

			<p class="normal">The following points seem to <a id="_idIndexMarker1593"/>be noticeable regarding the preceding code:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="list">The class <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Stack&lt;T&gt;</code> is a generic class. It means that its different instances can operate on various classes like <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">String</code>, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Integer</code>, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Point</code>, and so on, but every instance can operate only on the type specified upon instantiation.</li>
				<li class="list">The ability to store any data type in the underlying stack requires the stack to use an external marshaller to perform serialization and deserialization of the objects. The C stack library is able to store byte arrays in a stack data structure and higher-level languages willing to use its functionalities should be able to <a id="_idIndexMarker1594"/>provide that byte array through serialization of the input objects. You will see shortly the implementation of the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Marshaller</code> interface for the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">String</code> class.</li>
				<li class="list">We inject the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Marshaller</code> instance using the constructor. This means that we should have an already created marshaller instance that is compatible with the <em class="italics">generic</em> type of the class <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">T</code>.</li>
				<li class="list">The <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Stack&lt;T&gt;</code> class implements the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">AutoCloseable</code> interface. This simply means that it has some native resources that should be freed upon destruction. Note that the actual stack is created in the native code and not in the Java code. Therefore, the JVM's <em class="italics">garbage collector</em> cannot free the stack when it is not needed anymore. <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">AutoCloseable</code> objects can be used as resources which have a specific scope and when they are not needed anymore, their <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">close</code> method is called automatically. Shortly, you will see how we use the preceding class in a test scenario.</li>
				<li class="list">As you see, we have the constructor method and we have initialized the underlying stack using the native methods. We keep a handler to the stack as a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">long</code> field in the class. Note that unlike in C++, we don't have any destructors in the class. Therefore, it is possible not to have the underlying stack freed and for it eventually to become a memory leak. That's why we have marked the class as an <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">AutoCloseable</code>. When an <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">AutoCloseable</code> object is not needed anymore, its <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">close</code> method is called and as you see in the preceding code, we call the destructor function from the C stack library to release the resources allocated by the C stack.</li>
			</ul>
			<div><div><p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">Generally, you cannot<a id="_idIndexMarker1595"/> trust the garbage collector mechanism to call <em class="italics">finalizer methods</em> on Java objects and using the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">AutoCloseable</code> resources is the correct way to manage native resources.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal">The following is the implementation of <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">StringMarshaller</code>. The implementation is very straightforward thanks to the great support of the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">String</code> class in working with byte arrays:</p>

Native methods are declared within Java, but their definitions reside outside of the JVM in a shared object library. But how does the JVM find the definition of a native method in the loaded shared object files? The answer is simple: by looking up certain symbol names in the shared object files. The JVM extracts a symbol name for every native method based on its various properties like the package, the containing class, and its name. Then, it looks for that symbol in the loaded shared object libraries and if it cannot find it, it gives you an error.</p>
			<p class="normal">Based on what we established in the previous section, the JVM forces us to use specific symbol names for the functions we write as part of the loaded shared object file. But we didn't use any specific convention while creating the stack library. So, the JVM won't be able to find our exposed functions from the stack library and we must come up with another way. Generally, C libraries are written without any assumption about being used in a JVM environment.</p>
			<p class="normal"><em class="italics">Figure 21-1</em> shows how we can use an intermediate C or C++ library to act as a glue between the Java part and the native part. We give the JVM the symbols it wants, and we delegate the function calls made to the functions representing those symbols to the correct function inside the C library. This is basically how JNI works.</p>
			<p class="normal">We'll explain this with an imaginary example. Suppose that we want to make a call to a C function, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">func</code>, from Java, and the definition of the function can be found in the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">libfunc.so</code> shared object file. We also have a class <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Clazz</code> in the Java part with a native function called <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">doFunc</code>. We know that the JVM would be looking for the symbol <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Java_Clazz_doFunc</code> while trying to find the definition of the native function <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">doFunc</code>. We create an<a id="_idIndexMarker1600"/> intermediate shared object library <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">libNativeLibrary.so</code> that contains a function with exactly the same symbol that the JVM is looking for. Then, inside that function, we make a call to the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">func</code> function. We can say that the function <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Java_Clazz_doFunc</code> acts as a relay and delegates the call to the underlying C library and eventually the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">func</code> function.</p>

			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 21-1: The intermediate shared object libNativeStack.so which is used to delegate function calls from Java to the actual underlying C stack library, libcstack.so.</p>
			<p class="normal">In order to stay aligned with JVM symbol names, the Java compiler usually generates a C header file out of the native methods found in a Java code. This way, you only need to write the definitions of those functions found in the header file. This prevents us from making any<a id="_idIndexMarker1601"/> mistakes in the symbol names that the JVM eventually would be looking for.</p>
			<p class="normal">The following commands demonstrate how to compile a Java source file and how to ask the compiler to generate a header file for the found native methods in it. Here, we are going to compile our only Java file, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Main.java</code>, which contains all the Java code introduced in the previous code boxes.

			<p class="normal">Upon entering the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">with</code> block, the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">__enter__</code> function is called and an instance of the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Stack</code> class is referenced by the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">stack</code> variable. When leaving the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">with</code> block, the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">__exit__</code> function is called. This gives us the opportunity to<a id="_idIndexMarker1612"/> free the underlying native resources, the C stack object in this case, when they are not needed anymore.</p>
			<p class="normal">Next, you can see how to run the preceding code. Note that all the Python code boxes exist within the same file named <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">stack.py</code>. Before running the following commands, you need to be in the chapter's root directory:</p>
			<pre><strong class="highlight">$ cd python</strong>
<strong class="highlight">$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/.. python stack.py</strong>
Size after pushes:3
!
World
Hello
Size after pops:0
Size before clear:2
Size after clear:0
<strong class="highlight">$</strong></pre>
			<p class="packt_figref">Shell Box 21-14: Running the Python test scenario</p>
			<p class="normal">Note that the interpreter should be able to find and load the C stack shared library; therefore, we set the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable to point to the directory that contains the actual shared library file.</p>
			<p class="normal">In the following section, we show how to l<a id="_idTextAnchor615"/>oad and use the C stack library in the Go language.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-319" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor616"/>Integration with Go</h1>
			<p class="normal">The Go programming language (or simply Golang) has an easy integration with native shared libraries. It can<a id="_idIndexMarker1613"/> be considered as the next generation of the C and C++ programming languages and it calls itself a system programming language. Therefore, we expect to load and use the native libraries easily when using Golang.</p>
			<p class="normal">In Golang, we use a<a id="_idIndexMarker1614"/> built-in package called <em class="italics">cgo</em> to call C code and load the shared object files. In the following<a id="_idIndexMarker1615"/> Go code, you see how to use the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">cgo</code> package and use it to call the C functions loaded from the C stack library file. It also defines a new class, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Stack</code>, which is used by other Go code to use the C stack functionalities:</p>
			<pre>package main
/*
#cgo CFLAGS: -I..
#cgo LDFLAGS: -L.. -lcstack
#include "cstack.h"
*/
import "C"
import (
  "fmt"
)
type Stack struct {
  handler *C.cstack_t
}
func NewStack() *Stack {
  s := new(Stack)
  s.handler = C.cstack_new()
  C.cstack_ctor(s.handler, 100)
  return s
}
func (s *Stack) Destroy() {
  C.cstack_dtor(s.handler, C.deleter_t(C.free_value))
  C.cstack_delete(s.handler)
}
func (s *Stack) Size() int {
  return int(C.cstack_size(s.handler))
}
func (s *Stack) Push(item string) bool {
  value := C.make_value(C.CString(item), C.ulong(len(item) + 1))
  pushed := C.cstack_push(s.handler, value)
  return pushed == 1
}
func (s *Stack) Pop() (bool, string) {
  value := C.make_value(nil, 0)
  popped := C.cstack_pop(s.handler, &amp;value)
  str := C.GoString(value.data)
  defer C.free_value(&amp;value)
  return popped == 1, str
}
func (s *Stack) Clear() {
  C.cstack_clear(s.handler, C.deleter_t(C.free_value))
}</pre>
			<p class="packt_figref">Code Box 21-19 [go/stack.go]: The Stack class using the loaded libcstack.so shared object file</p>
			<p class="normal">In order to use the cgo package, one needs to import the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">C</code> package. It loads the shared object libraries specified in the pseudo <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">#cgo</code> directives. As you see, we have specified the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">libcstack.so</code> library to be loaded as part of the directive <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">#cgo LDFLAGS: -L.. -lcstack</code>. Note that the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">CFLAGS</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">LDFLAGS</code> contain the flags that are directly passed to the C compiler and to the linker respectively.</p>
			<p class="normal">We have also indicated the path that should be searched for the shared object file. After that, we can use the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">C</code> struct to call the loaded native functions. For example, we have used <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">C.cstack_new()</code> to call the corresponding function from the stack library. It is pretty easy with cgo. Note that the preceding <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Stack</code> class only works on string items.</p>
			<p class="normal">The following<a id="_idIndexMarker1616"/> code shows the test scenario written in Golang. Note that we have to call the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Destroy</code> function on the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">stack</code> object when quitting the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">main</code> function:</p>
			<pre>func main() {
  var stack = NewStack()
  stack.Push("Hello")
  stack.Push("World")
  stack.Push("!")
  fmt.Println("Stack size:", stack.Size())
  for stack.Size() &gt; 0 {
    _, str := stack.Pop()
    fmt.Println("Popped &gt;", str)
  }
  fmt.Println("Stack size after pops:", stack.Size())
  stack.Push("Bye")
  stack.Push("Bye")
  fmt.Println("Stack size before clear:", stack.Size())
  stack.Clear()
  fmt.Println("Stack size after clear:", stack.Size())
  stack.Destroy()

			<p class="packt_figref">Shell Box 21-15: Running the Go test scenario</p>
			<p class="normal">As you see in Golang, unlike Python, you need to compile your program first, and then run it. In addition, we still need to set the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable in order to allow the executable to locate the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">libcstack.so</code> library and load it.</p>
			<p class="normal">In this section, we showed how to use the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">cgo</code> package in Golang to load and use shared object libraries. Since Golang behaves like a thin wrapper around C code, it has been easier than using Python and Ja<a id="_idTextAnchor617"/>va to load an external shared object library and use it.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-320" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor618"/>Summary</h1>
			<p class="normal">In this chapter, we went through the integration of C within other programming languages. As part of this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="list">We designed a C library that was exposing some stack functionality such as push, pop, and so on. We built the library and as the final output we generated a shared object library to be used by other languages.</li>
				<li class="list">We discussed the name mangling feature in C++, and how we should avoid it in C when using a C++ compiler.</li>
				<li class="list">We wrote a C++ wrapper around the stack library that could load the library's shared object file and execute the loaded functionalities within C++.</li>
				<li class="list">We continued by writing a JNI wrapper around the C library. We used native methods to achieve that.</li>
				<li class="list">We showed how to write native code in JNI and connect the native part and Java part together, and finally run a Java program that uses the C stack library.</li>
				<li class="list">We managed to write Python code that was using the ctypes package to load and use the library's shared object file.</li>
				<li class="list">As the final section, we wrote a program in Golang that could load the library's shared object file with help from the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">cgo</code> package.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">The next chapter is about unit testing and debugging in C. We will introduce some C libraries meant for writing unit tests. More than that, we talk about debugging in C, and some of the existing tools that could be used to debug or monitor a program.</p>
