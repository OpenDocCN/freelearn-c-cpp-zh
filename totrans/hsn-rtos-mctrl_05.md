# Section 2: Toolchain Setup

If you've ever felt overwhelmed when trying to decide which microcontroller or IDE to use, this section is for you. In this section, you'll learn what differentiates one MCU from another, how to select an IDE or toolchain that fits your workflow, and how to go about debugging and troubleshooting a real-time system. Instructions for setting up STMCubeIDE are in [Chapter 5](84a945dc-ff6c-4ec8-8b9c-84842db68a85.xhtml)*, Selecting an IDE,* and the SEGGER debugging tools setup is covered in [Chapter 6](699daa80-06ae-4acc-8b93-a81af2eb774b.xhtml),* Debugging Tools for Real-Time Systems*. Both of these will be required for working through the examples.
