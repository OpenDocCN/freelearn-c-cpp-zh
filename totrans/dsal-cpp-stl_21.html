			<p>This chapter will explore the interplay between the STL and two of C++’s advanced features: concepts and coroutines. This chapter is designed to deepen your understanding of how these modern C++ features enhance and interact with <span class="No-Break">the STL.</span></p>
			<p>We begin by learning about concepts, starting with an introduction and progressively exploring their role in refining STL algorithm constraints, enhancing data structures, and developing custom concepts. This section is crucial for grasping how explicit type constraints can lead to more robust and <span class="No-Break">readable code.</span></p>
			<p>Following this, we focus on coroutines, providing a refresher before examining their integration with STL algorithms and data structures. This includes exploring potential synergies with ranges and views, culminating in discussing how coroutines might herald a paradigm shift in <span class="No-Break">C++ programming.</span></p>
			<p>This chapter will provide a comprehensive understanding and practical insights into using these features effectively, highlighting their importance in modern C++ development and their <span class="No-Break">potential challenges.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-748"><a id="_idTextAnchor748"/>Concepts</h1>
			<p>The introduction of concepts in C++20 marked a pivotal step towards safer and more expressive templated programming. With their inherent ability to specify constraints on template arguments, concepts promise to reshape how we interact with and utilize the <strong class="bold">Standard Template Library</strong> (<strong class="bold">STL</strong>). Let’s discover how concepts intertwine with the rich tapestry of STL algorithms and data structures to create a more robust and declarative C++ <span class="No-Break">programming paradigm.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-749"><a id="_idTextAnchor749"/>A brief introduction to concepts</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Concepts</strong> provide<a id="_idIndexMarker1133"/> a mechanism to specify and check constraints on template arguments. Essentially, they allow developers to assert requirements about the types passed to a template. Concepts aim to make template errors more readable, help avoid common pitfalls, and promote the creation of more generic and <span class="No-Break">reusable code.</span></p>
			<p>Consider the following concept for an <span class="No-Break">arithmetic type:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
template&lt;typename T&gt;
concept Arithmetic = std::is_arithmetic_v&lt;T&gt;;</pre>			<p>Using this concept, one can constrain a function only to accept <span class="No-Break">arithmetic types:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
template&lt;Arithmetic T&gt;
T add(T a, T b) { return (a + b); }</pre>			<h2 id="_idParaDest-750"><a id="_idTextAnchor750"/>Refined constraints in STL algorithms</h2>
			<p>STL algorithms, historically, have relied on complex, sometimes nebulous requirements for their <a id="_idIndexMarker1134"/>template parameters. With concepts, these requirements become explicit and understandable. For instance, the <strong class="source-inline">std::sort</strong> algorithm requires random access iterators, which can now be asserted using concepts. This leads to more precise error messages if one mistakenly uses a list (which only provides <span class="No-Break">bidirectional iterators).</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-751"><a id="_idTextAnchor751"/>Effectively constraining templates</h2>
			<p>When<a id="_idIndexMarker1135"/> working with C++ template programming, ensuring that a given type satisfies a specific set of requirements has historically been challenging. Before the introduction of concepts, developers would rely on complex techniques involving <strong class="bold">substitution failure is not an error</strong> (<strong class="bold">SFINAE</strong>) or specialized trait classes to impose type constraints. These methods were verbose and error-prone, often resulting in convoluted error messages that were difficult <span class="No-Break">to decipher.</span></p>
			<p>Concepts allow developers to define a set of predicates that a type must satisfy, offering a more structured and readable way to constrain templates. Using concepts, you can specify the requirements that template arguments must meet. When a type does not match the constraints defined by a concept, the compiler will reject the template instantiation, producing a more straightforward and more meaningful error message. This enhances the template code’s readability, maintainability, and robustness. With concepts, the compiler can quickly ascertain the suitability of a type for a given template, ensuring that only appropriate types are utilized, thereby minimizing the potential for runtime errors or <span class="No-Break">undefined behavior.</span></p>
			<p>Here’s a code example that demonstrates the use of concepts and how the same task had to be carried out before the introduction <span class="No-Break">of concepts:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;type_traits&gt;
// Create a class that is not inherently printable.
struct NotPrintable
{
  int foo{0};
  int bar{0};
};
// Concept definition using the 'requires' clause
template &lt;typename T&gt;
concept Printable = requires(T t) {
  // Requires that t can be printed to std::cout
  std::cout &lt;&lt; t;
};
// Before C++20:
// A Function template that uses SFINAE to implement a
// "Printable concept"
template &lt;typename T,
          typename = typename std::enable_if&lt;std::is_same&lt;
              decltype(std::cout &lt;&lt; std::declval&lt;T&gt;()),
              std::ostream &amp;&gt;::value&gt;::type&gt;
void printValueSFINAE(const T &amp;value) {
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Value: " &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; "\n";
}
// After C++20:
// A Function template that uses the Printable concept
template &lt;Printable T&gt; void printValue(const T &amp;value) {
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Value: " &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; "\n";
}
int main() {
  const int num = 42;
  const NotPrintable np;
  const std::string str = "Hello, Concepts!";
  // Using the function template with SFINAE
  printValueSFINAE(num);
  // This line would fail to compile:
  // printValueSFINAE(np);
  printValueSFINAE(str);
  // Using the function template with concepts
  printValue(num);
  // This line would fail to compile
  // printValue(np);
  printValue(str);
  return 0;
}</pre>			<p>Here is the <span class="No-Break">example output:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
Value: 42
Value: Hello, Concepts!
Value: 42
Value: Hello, Concepts!</pre>			<p>In this example, we define a concept called <strong class="source-inline">Printable</strong> using the required clause. The <strong class="source-inline">Printable</strong> concept checks if a type can be printed to <strong class="source-inline">std::cout</strong>. We then have two function templates, <strong class="source-inline">printValue</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">printValueSFINAE</strong>, that print a value if it satisfies the concept or the SFINAE <span class="No-Break">condition, respectively.</span></p>
			<p>When using the <strong class="source-inline">printValue</strong> function template with the <strong class="source-inline">Printable</strong> concept, the compiler will ensure that the type passed to it can be printed, and if not, it will produce a clear error message. This makes the code more readable and provides meaningful <span class="No-Break">error messages.</span></p>
			<p>On the other <a id="_idIndexMarker1136"/>hand, when using the <strong class="source-inline">printValueSFINAE</strong> function template, we rely on SFINAE to achieve the same task. This approach is more verbose and error-prone, as it involves complex <strong class="source-inline">std::enable_if</strong> constructs and may lead to cryptic error messages when the constraints <span class="No-Break">are unmet.</span></p>
			<p>By comparing these two approaches, you can see how concepts improve the readability, maintainability, and robustness of C++ template code, making it easier to specify and enforce <span class="No-Break">type requirements.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-752"><a id="_idTextAnchor752"/>Enhanced data structures with explicit requirements</h2>
			<p>STL<a id="_idIndexMarker1137"/> containers, such as <strong class="source-inline">std::vector</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">std::map</strong>, often have their requirements for stored types, such as being copy-constructible or assignable. Concepts can articulate these requirements with <span class="No-Break">great clarity.</span></p>
			<p>Imagine a custom container that necessitates its elements to be default constructible. This requirement can be eloquently expressed with concepts, ensuring safer and more predictable <span class="No-Break">container behavior.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-753"><a id="_idTextAnchor753"/>Custom concepts and STL interactions</h2>
			<p>One <a id="_idIndexMarker1138"/>of the strengths of concepts is that they’re not limited to the ones provided by the standard library. Developers can create custom concepts tailored to specific needs, ensuring that STL structures and algorithms can be adapted to unique and complex scenarios without sacrificing <span class="No-Break">type safety.</span></p>
			<p>For instance, if a particular algorithm demands types with a specific interface (such as having a <strong class="source-inline">draw()</strong> member function), one can design a concept to enforce this, leading to more intuitive and self-documenting code. Let's look at a <span class="No-Break">code example:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
#include &lt;concepts&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
template &lt;typename T&gt;
concept Drawable = requires(T obj) {
  { obj.draw() } -&gt; std::convertible_to&lt;void&gt;;
};
class Circle {
public:
  void draw() const { std::cout &lt;&lt; "Drawing a circle.\n"; }
};
class Square {
public:
  // No draw() member function
};
template &lt;Drawable T&gt; void drawShape(const T &amp;shape) {
  shape.draw();
}
int main() {
  Circle circle;
  Square square;
  drawShape(circle);
  // Uncommenting the line below would result in
  // 'drawShape': no matching overloaded function found:
  // drawShape(square);
  return 0;
}</pre>			<p>Here is the <span class="No-Break">example output:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
Drawing a circle.</pre>			<p>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker1139"/> preceding code example, we do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>We define a custom concept called <strong class="source-inline">Drawable</strong>, which requires a type with a <strong class="source-inline">draw()</strong> member function <span class="No-Break">returning </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">void.</strong></span></li>
				<li>We create two example classes: <strong class="source-inline">Circle</strong>, which satisfies the <strong class="source-inline">Drawable</strong> concept by having a <strong class="source-inline">draw()</strong> member function, and <strong class="source-inline">Square</strong>, which does not satisfy the concept because it lacks the <strong class="source-inline">draw()</strong> <span class="No-Break">member function.</span></li>
				<li>We define a generic function called <strong class="source-inline">drawShape</strong>, which takes a <strong class="source-inline">Drawable</strong> type as a parameter and calls its <strong class="source-inline">draw()</strong> <span class="No-Break">member function.</span></li>
				<li>In the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> function, we create instances of <strong class="source-inline">Circle</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Square</strong> and demonstrate that <strong class="source-inline">drawShape</strong> can be called with a <strong class="source-inline">Drawable</strong> type (e.g., <strong class="source-inline">Circle</strong>) but not with a type that does not satisfy the <strong class="source-inline">Drawable</strong> concept (<span class="No-Break">e.g., </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Square</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This example illustrates how custom concepts can enforce specific interface requirements, ensuring type safety and making the code more intuitive and self-documenting when working with complex scenarios and algorithms <span class="No-Break">in C++.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-754"><a id="_idTextAnchor754"/>Potential challenges and caveats</h2>
			<p>While concepts <a id="_idIndexMarker1140"/>are undeniably powerful, there are a few considerations to <span class="No-Break">be made:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Complexity</strong>: Designing intricate custom concepts can be challenging and may steepen the learning curve <span class="No-Break">for newcomers</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Compile times</strong>: As with most template-based features, over-reliance or misuse can increase <span class="No-Break">compilation times</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Backward compatibility</strong>: Older codebases may require refactoring to leverage or comply fully with new <span class="No-Break">concept-driven constraints</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This section provided a window into a powerful feature in C++ that allows us to specify constraints on template parameters. We began with a brief introduction to concepts, understanding their role in enhancing the expressiveness and safety of our code. We then explored how refined constraints can be applied in STL algorithms, leading to more robust and readable code. We also learned how to constrain templates effectively, which is crucial for preventing the misuse of our code and ensuring that it behaves <span class="No-Break">as expected.</span></p>
			<p>However, we also acknowledged the potential challenges and caveats associated with concepts. While they offer many benefits, using them judiciously is important to avoid unnecessary complexity and <span class="No-Break">potential pitfalls.</span></p>
			<p>The knowledge gained from this section is invaluable as it equips us with the tools to write safer, more expressive, and more efficient code using the STL. It also prepares us for the next section, where we will explore another exciting feature of <span class="No-Break">C++: coroutines.</span></p>
			<p>The next section will refresh our understanding of coroutines and discuss their integration with STL algorithms and data structures. We will also explore potential synergies with ranges and views, which can lead to even more efficient and elegant code. Finally, we will look at how coroutines represent a paradigm shift in how we write <span class="No-Break">asynchronous code.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-755"><a id="_idTextAnchor755"/>Coroutines</h1>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker1141"/> integration of coroutines into C++20 ushers in a new paradigm for asynchronous programming that’s more readable and intuitive. By allowing functions to be suspended and resumed, coroutines offer an alternative to the callback-heavy style often seen in asynchronous C++ code. While transformative in its own right, this evolution also provides fresh, innovative ways to interact with the venerable STL. Examining the interaction of coroutines with STL algorithms and data structures reveals how they simplify <span class="No-Break">asynchronous operations.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-756"><a id="_idTextAnchor756"/>Understanding coroutines – a refresher</h2>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">coroutine</strong> is a generalization of a function. While a traditional function runs to completion and then returns, a coroutine can be paused at specific points, returning control to the caller and then later resuming from where it left off. Three primary keywords are vital to understanding coroutines in C++: <strong class="source-inline">co_await</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">co_return</strong>, <span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">co_yield</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">co_await</strong>: Suspends the current coroutine until the awaited expression is ready, at which point the <span class="No-Break">coroutine resumes</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">co_return</strong>: This is used to finish the coroutine, potentially returning <span class="No-Break">a value</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">co_yield</strong>: Produces a value in a generator-like fashion, allowing iteration over <span class="No-Break">a coroutine</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-757"><a id="_idTextAnchor757"/>STL algorithms and coroutine integration</h2>
			<p>With<a id="_idIndexMarker1142"/> coroutines, STL algorithms that previously demanded a more convoluted asynchronous approach can now be elegantly written with direct, linear logic. Consider algorithms that operate on sequences or ranges; they can be combined with coroutines to asynchronously <span class="No-Break">generate values.</span></p>
			<p>For instance, a coroutine could asynchronously produce values and then process them using <strong class="source-inline">std::transform</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">std::for_each</strong>, weaving asynchronous code seamlessly with synchronous <span class="No-Break">STL algorithms.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-758"><a id="_idTextAnchor758"/>Coroutines and STL data structures</h2>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker1143"/>magic of coroutines also touches the realm of STL data structures. Coroutines present an intriguing potential for containers such as <strong class="source-inline">std::vector</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">std::list: </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">populating</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (asynchronously).</span></p>
			<p>Imagine a scenario where data must be fetched from a network source and stored in <strong class="source-inline">std::vector</strong>. A coroutine can be used to fetch the data asynchronously, yielding values as they arrive, and then these values can be directly inserted into the vector. This blend of asynchronicity with the directness of STL data structures simplifies code and reduces <span class="No-Break">cognitive overhead.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-759"><a id="_idTextAnchor759"/>Potential synergies with ranges and views</h2>
			<p>As the C++ language <a id="_idIndexMarker1144"/>evolves, other features, such as ranges and views, combined with coroutines, can offer a more expressive way to handle data manipulation and transformation. Coroutines can generate ranges, which can be lazily evaluated, filtered, and transformed using views, resulting in a robust and composable asynchronous <span class="No-Break">programming model.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s look at the following code example that involves the <span class="No-Break">following steps:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">STL data structure</strong>: We will use <strong class="source-inline">std::vector&lt;int&gt;</strong> to store a sequence <span class="No-Break">of numbers.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Coroutine</strong>: A generator that asynchronously generates numbers to populate <span class="No-Break">our vector.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">STL algorithms and ranges</strong>: We will filter the numbers in the vector to keep only even numbers <span class="No-Break">using </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">std::ranges::copy_if</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Views</strong>: By using <strong class="source-inline">std::views::transform</strong>, we’ll multiply each number by two. First, we must create our <strong class="source-inline">generator</strong> class with a special <strong class="source-inline">promise_type</strong> structure that our coroutine will use. The generator class template and its nested <strong class="source-inline">promise_type</strong> structure in this code are key components in implementing a coroutine for generating a sequence of values <span class="No-Break">in C++.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">generator</strong> is a class <a id="_idIndexMarker1145"/>template designed to produce a sequence of values of type <strong class="source-inline">T</strong>, one at a time, upon request. It encapsulates the coroutine’s state and provides an interface to control its execution and access the <span class="No-Break">yielded values.</span></p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">promise_type</strong> nested <a id="_idIndexMarker1146"/>within the generator is the coroutine’s lifecycle and state management backbone. It holds the current value to be yielded (value) and defines several <span class="No-Break">key functions:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">get_return_object</strong>: Returns the generator object associated with <span class="No-Break">this coroutine</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">initial_suspend</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">final_suspend</strong>: Control the coroutine’s execution, suspending it initially and <span class="No-Break">after completion</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">unhandled_exception</strong>: Defines behavior for unhandled exceptions, terminating <span class="No-Break">the program</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">return_void</strong>: A placeholder for when the coroutine reaches <span class="No-Break">its end</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">yield_value</strong>: This is called when a value is yielded (co_yield), suspending the coroutine and storing the <span class="No-Break">yielded value</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The code example below is broken into several sections (the complete example can be found in the book's <span class="No-Break">GitHub repository):</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
template &lt;typename T&gt; class generator {
public:
  struct promise_type {
    T value;
    auto get_return_object() {
      return generator{handle_type::from_promise(*this)};
    }
    auto initial_suspend() {
      return std::suspend_always{};
    }
    auto final_suspend() noexcept {
      return std::suspend_always{};
    }
    void unhandled_exception() { std::terminate(); }
    void return_void() {}
    auto yield_value(T x) {
      value = x;
      return std::suspend_always{};
    }
  };
  using handle_type = std::coroutine_handle&lt;promise_type&gt;;

  generator(generator &amp;&amp;o) noexcept
      : m_handle(std::exchange(o.m_handle, {})) {}
  ~generator() {
    if (m_handle) m_handle.destroy();
  }
  bool next() {
    m_handle.resume();
    return !m_handle.done();
  }
  T value() const { return m_handle.promise().value; }
private:
  handle_type m_handle;
};</pre>			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker1147"/>preceding code defines a generic template class called <strong class="source-inline">generator</strong>. This class is instantiated as the return type of the <strong class="source-inline">generate_numbers</strong> function, which creates a sequence of integers from start to end. When called, it initiates a coroutine that iteratively yields integers within the specified range. Each iteration suspends the coroutine, making the current value available to the caller. The generator class provides mechanisms to resume the coroutine (<strong class="source-inline">next()</strong>) and retrieve the current value (<strong class="source-inline">value()</strong>). The generator’s constructor, move constructor, destructor, and deleted copy constructor manage the coroutine’s lifecycle and ensure proper <span class="No-Break">resource management.</span></p>
			<p>That was the hard part. Now, we can get to work building and using <span class="No-Break">our coroutine:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">

      std::views::transform([](int n) { return n * 2; });
  for (int n : transformed) { std::cout &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; " "; }
  return 0;

			<pre class="console">

			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-760"><a id="_idTextAnchor760"/>Looking ahead – a paradigm shift</h2>
			<p>Coroutines in C++ represent a significant advancement in the domain of asynchronous programming. By introducing a standardized way to handle asynchronous tasks, coroutines facilitate writing nonblocking, efficient, and maintainable code. When used in conjunction with the STL, coroutines have the potential to streamline complex operations, transforming the landscape of <span class="No-Break">C++ programming.</span></p>
			<p>The STL provides a robust framework for data manipulation and algorithm implementation. The introduction of coroutines enhances this framework by offering a concurrency model that is less error-prone and more intuitive than traditional threading mechanisms. This synergy allows for developing sophisticated asynchronous programs to leverage the full power of the STL’s containers, iterators, and algorithms without <span class="No-Break">compromising performance.</span></p>
			<p>As coroutines become more integrated within the STL, we anticipate a paradigm shift where high-performance code will not only be characterized by its speed but also by its clarity and modular structure. The adoption of coroutines is poised to expand, driven by their ability to produce scalable and <span class="No-Break">responsive software.</span></p>
			<p>The future iterations of the C++ standard will likely introduce more features that complement the coroutine–STL interface, providing developers with a richer toolkit. This evolution will solidify C++’s role as a premier language for developing high-performance, asynchronous applications. The commitment to continual improvement within the C++ community maintains the language’s relevance and efficacy in solving modern <span class="No-Break">programming challenges.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-761"><a id="_idTextAnchor761"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>This chapter uncovered the integration of C++20’s concepts and coroutines with the STL. We began by exploring the role of concepts in templated programming. Concepts strengthen code robustness by enforcing type constraints and enhancing the expressivity and safety of template use. They replace error-prone SFINAE techniques with a more readable and declarative syntax. We saw how concepts improve the clarity of algorithms’ requirements, leading to more <span class="No-Break">maintainable code.</span></p>
			<p>Next, we examined how coroutines introduce a new level of sophistication to asynchronous programming in C++. We discussed the mechanics of coroutines, emphasizing the use of <strong class="source-inline">co_await</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">co_return</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">co_yield</strong> for creating nonblocking operations. We looked at how coroutines can interact with STL data structures and algorithms, allowing asynchronous and synchronous code to <span class="No-Break">blend seamlessly.</span></p>
			<p>Understanding the interplay between concepts, coroutines, and the STL is crucial. It enables us to write code that is not just performant but also clear and reliable. This knowledge equips us to tackle complex programming scenarios with confidence <span class="No-Break">and foresight.</span></p>
			<p>Next, we will focus on applying execution policies that enable parallelism in STL algorithms. The chapter will guide us through the nuances of parallel execution policies, the role of <strong class="source-inline">constexpr</strong> in enhancing compile-time optimizations, and the best practices for achieving optimal performance in <span class="No-Break">concurrent environments.</span></p>
