<h1 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Working with Unreal Engine</h1>
<p><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>In the previous chapter, we went through the basics of the Epic Games Launcher, along with Unreal Editor fundamentals. We learned how to work with objects and what Blueprints are at a basic level, in addition to exploring the First Person template. In this chapter, we’ll be building upon those fundamentals by exploring the Third Person template and working with input and animations. </p>
<p>Game development can be done in a wide variety of languages, such as C, C++, Java, C#, and even Python. While each language has pros and cons, we will be using C++ throughout this book as it is the primary programming language that’s used within Unreal Engine.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will get you up to speed on how to create a C++ project and perform basic-level debugging in UE5. It is very important to be able to debug code as it helps the developer while dealing with bugs. The tools provided come in very handy and are essential for any Unreal Engine developer.</p>
<p>Following this, we will get up close and personal with the core classes involved in creating games and experiences in Unreal Engine. You will explore Game Mode and the relevant class concepts, followed by an exercise to gain a hands-on understanding of this.</p>
<p>The final section in this chapter is all about animations. Almost every single game features animations, some to a very basic extent, but some to a very high level, which includes captivating details that are key to the gameplay experience. Unreal Engine offers several tools you can use to create and deal with animations, including the Animation Blueprint, which provides complex graphs, and a State Machine.</p>
<p>This chapter will focus on many of the basic concepts and features within Unreal Engine. You will be shown how to create a C++ project, how to perform some basic debugging, and how to work with character-specific animations.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating and setting up a blank C++ project</li>
<li>The Content folder’s structure in Unreal Engine</li>
<li>Working with the Visual Studio solution</li>
<li>Importing the required assets</li>
<li>The Unreal Game Mode class</li>
<li>Understanding levels and the Level Blueprint</li>
<li>Animations</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of this chapter, you’ll be able to create C++ template projects and debug code within Visual Studio, understand the folder structure and the best practices involved, and be able to set up character animations based on their states.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Technical requirements </h1>
<p>This chapter has the following technical requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>UE5 installed</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2019 installed</li>
<li>The complete code for this chapter can be downloaded from this book’s GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Elevating-Game-Experiences-with-Unreal-Engine-5-Second-Edition">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Elevating-Game-Experiences-with-Unreal-Engine-5-Second-Edition</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Creating and setting up a blank C++ project</h1>
<p>At the start of every project, you may <a id="_idIndexMarker160"/>want to start with any of the templates provided<a id="_idIndexMarker161"/> by Epic (which contain ready-to-execute basic code) and build on top of that. Most/some of the time, you may need to set up a blank or empty project that you can mold and sculpt to your requirements. We’ll learn how to do that in the following exercise<a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Exercise 2.01 – creating an empty C++ project</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you will learn how to <a id="_idIndexMarker162"/>create an empty C++ project from the template provided by Epic. This will serve as the foundation for many of your future C++ projects.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to complete this exercise:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch UE5 from the Epic Games Launcher.</li>
<li>Click on the <code>BLANK PROJECT</code> section and click <code>Blank</code>.</li>
<li>Under the <strong class="bold">Project Defaults</strong> section on the right pane, select <strong class="bold">C++</strong><strong class="bold">.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">Make sure that the project folder and project name are specified with an appropriate directory and name, respectively.</p>
<ol>
<li value="4">When everything is set up, click on the <code>UnrealProjects</code>, which is inside the <code>E</code> drive. The project name is set to <code>MyBlankProj</code> (it is recommended that you use these names and project directories, but you can use your own if you wish to do so).</li>
</ol>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">The project name cannot have any spaces in it. It is preferable to have an Unreal directory as close to the root of a drive as possible (to avoid running into issues such as the 256-character path limit when creating or importing assets into your project’s working directory; for small projects, it may be fine, but for more large-scale projects, where the folder hierarchy may become too complex, this step is important).</p>
<ol>
<li value="5">After it’s done generating the code and creating the project files, the project will open, along with its Visual Studio solution (<code>.sln</code>) file. </li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure that the Visual Studio solution configuration is set to <strong class="bold">Development Editor</strong> and that the solution platform is set to <strong class="bold">Win64</strong> for desktop development:</p>

<p>By completing this exercise, you know how to create an empty C++ project on UE5, along with its considerations.</p>
<p>In the next section, we’ll talk <a id="_idIndexMarker163"/>about the folder structure, along with the most basic and most used folder structure format that’s used by Unreal developers.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>The Content folder’s structure in Unreal Engine</h1>
<p>In your project directory (in our case, <code>E:/UnrealProjects/MyBlankProj</code>), you will see a <code>Content</code> folder. This is the <a id="_idIndexMarker164"/>primary folder that your project uses for different types of assets and project-relevant data (including Blueprints). The C++ code goes into the <code>Source</code> folder in your project. Please note that the best practice is to <a id="_idIndexMarker165"/>create new C++ code files directly through the Unreal Editor as this simplifies the process and results in fewer errors.</p>
<p>There are many different strategies you can use to organize the data inside your <code>Content</code> folder. The most basic and easy-to-understand is using folder names to depict the type of content inside. Therefore, a <code>Content</code> folder directory structure may resemble the example at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Game-Development-Projects-with-Unreal-Engine/blob/master/Chapter02/Images/06New.png">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Game-Development-Projects-with-Unreal-Engine/blob/master/Chapter02/Images/06New.png</a>. In this example, you can see that each file is categorically placed under the name of the folder representing its type at the first level, with the following levels further grouping it into meaningful folders.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">All Blueprints should prefix <code>BP</code> to their name (to differentiate them from the default blueprints used by Unreal Engine). The rest of the prefixes are optional (however, it is best practice to<a id="_idIndexMarker166"/> format them with the prefixes shown earlier).</p>
<p>In the next section, we will look<a id="_idIndexMarker167"/> at the Visual Studio so<a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>lution.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Working with the Visual Studio solution</h1>
<p>Every C++ project in Unreal Engine<a id="_idIndexMarker168"/> has a Visual Studio solution. This, in turn, drives all the code and allows developers to set up execution logic and debug code in its running state. </p>
<p><strong class="bold">Solution Analysis</strong></p>
<p>The Visual Studio solution (.<code>sln</code>) file that’s produced inside the project directory contains the entire project and any associated code that’s been added to it. </p>
<p>Let’s have a look at the files present in Visual Studio. Double-click the .<code>sln</code> file to open it within Visual Studio.</p>
<p>In <code>Engine</code> and <code>Games</code>.</p>
<p><strong class="bold">The Engine Project</strong></p>
<p>At the base level, Unreal Engine itself is a Visual Studio project and has a solution file. This contains all the code and third-party integrations that work together in Unreal Engine. All the code within this <a id="_idIndexMarker169"/>project is called the <strong class="bold">source</strong> code.</p>
<p>The Engine project consists of the external dependencies, configurations, plugins, shaders, and source code of Unreal Engine that are currently being used for this project. You can, at any time, browse the <code>UE5</code> | <code>Source</code> folder to view any of the engine co<a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>de.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">As Unreal Engine is open source, Epic allows developers to both view and edit source code to suit their needs and requirements. However, you cannot edit the source code in the version of Unreal Engine that’s installed via the Epic Games Launcher. To be able to make and build changes in source code, you need to download the source version of Unreal Engine, which can be found via GitHub. You can use the following guide to download the source version of Unreal Engine: <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/GettingStarted/DownloadingUnrealEngine/index.xhtml">https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/GettingStarted/DownloadingUnrealEngine/index.xhtml</a>.</p>
<p class="callout">After downloading, you can also refer to the following guide to compile/build the newly downloaded engine: <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Programming/Development/BuildingUnrealEngine/index.xhtml">https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Programming/Development/BuildingUnrealEngine/index.xhtml</a>.</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Game Project</strong></p>
<p>Under the <code>Games</code> directory is the solution<a id="_idIndexMarker170"/> folder that’s named after your project. Upon expansion, you’ll find a set of folders. You will need to understand the following ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Config folder</strong>: This folder carries <a id="_idIndexMarker171"/>all the configurations that have been set up for the project and the build (these can optionally have platform-specific (such as Windows, Android, iOS, Xbox, or PlayStation) settings as well).</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Plugins folder</strong>: This is an optional folder that’s <a id="_idIndexMarker172"/>created when you add any third-party plugin (downloaded from the Epic Marketplace or obtained through the internet). This folder will contain all of the source code of the plugins associated with this project.</li>
<li><code>Build Target</code> files, as well as all the source code for the project. The following is a description of the default files in the source folder:<ul><li><code>.Target.cs</code> extension, and one build file that ends with <code>Build.cs</code>.</li><li><strong class="bold">ProjectName code files (.cpp and .h)</strong>: By default, these files are created for each project and contain the code that’s used to run the default game module code.</li><li><strong class="bold">ProjectNameGameModeBase code files (.cpp and .h)</strong>: By default, an empty <strong class="bold">Project Game Mode Base</strong> is created. It’s not used in most cases.</li><li><strong class="bold">ProjectName.uproject file</strong>: This file contains the descriptors used to provide basic <a id="_idIndexMarker174"/>information about the project and the list of plugins associ<a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>ated with it.</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>Debugging code in Visual Studio</h2>
<p>Visual Studio provides<a id="_idIndexMarker175"/> powerful debugging features with the help of breakpoints in code. This allows users to pause the game at a particular line of code so that the developer can see the current values of variables and step through the code and game in a controlled fashion (they can proceed line by line, function by function, and so on). </p>
<p>This is useful when you have a lot of variables and code files in your game project, and you want to see the values of the variables being updated and used in a step-by-step fashion to debug the code, find out what issues there are, and solve them. Debugging is a fundamental process of any developer’s work, and only after many continuous debugging, profiling, and optimization cycles does a project get polished enough for deployment.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve got the basic idea of the Visual Studio solution, we’ll move on and cover a practical e<a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>xercise on it.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Exercise 2.02 – debugging the Third Person template code</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you’ll be <a id="_idIndexMarker176"/>creating a project using the <code>BaseTurnRate</code> in the <code>Character</code> class of this template project. We’ll learn how the value updates as we move through the code, line by line.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to complete this exercise:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Launch Unreal Engine from the Epic Games Launcher.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Games</strong> section and click <strong class="bold">Next</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong class="bold">Third Person</strong> and click <strong class="bold">Next</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <code>ThirdPersonDebug</code>, and click the <strong class="bold">Create Project</strong> button.</li>
<li>Now, close Unreal Editor, go to<a id="_idIndexMarker177"/> the Visual Studio solution, and open the <code>ThirdPersonDebugCharacter.cpp</code> file:</li>

<p>Similarly, you are encouraged<a id="_idIndexMarker181"/> to step in and debug other sections of the code to not only familiarize yourself with the debugger but also to understand how the code works behind the scenes. </p>
<p>By completing this exercise, you’ve learned how to set up debug points in Visual Studio, as well as stop debugging at a point, and then continue line by line while watching an object and its variable’s values. This is an important aspect for any developer, and many often use this tool to get rid of pesky bugs within code, especially when there are a lot of code flows and the number of variables is<a id="_idTextAnchor060"/> quite large.</p>
<p>At any point, you can stop debugging, restart debugging, or continue with the rest of the code by using the buttons on the top menu bar, as shown here:</p>

<p>Now, we’ll look at importing assets into an Unreal project.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>Importing the required assets</h1>
<p>Unreal Engine allows <a id="_idIndexMarker182"/>users to import a wide range of file types for users to customize their projects. There are several import options that developers can tweak and play around with to match their required settings. </p>
<p>Some common file types that game developers often import are FBX for scenes, meshes, animations (exported from Maya and other similar software), movie files, images (mostly for the user interface), textures, sounds, data in CSV files, and fonts. These files may be obtained from the Epic Marketplace or any other means (such as the internet) and used within the project.</p>
<p>Assets can be imported by dragging and dropping them into the <code>Content</code> folder, or by clicking the <strong class="bold">Import</strong> button in the <strong class="bold">Content Browser</strong> area.</p>
<p>Now let’s tackle an exercise where we’ll learn how to import FBX files and see how <a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>this is done.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Exercise 2.03 – importing a character FBX file</h2>
<p>This exercise will focus on importing a<a id="_idIndexMarker183"/> 3D model from an FBX file. FBX files are widely used to export and import 3D models, along with their materials, animations, and textures.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to complete this exercise:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Download the <code>SK_Mannequin.FBX</code>, <code>ThirdPersonIdle.FBX</code>, <code>ThirdPersonRun.FBX</code>, and <code>ThirdPersonWalk.FBX</code> files from the <code>Chapter02</code> | <code>Exercise2.03</code> | <code>ExerciseFiles</code> directory, which can be found on GitHub.</li>

<li>If you double-click on <code>ThirdPersonIdle</code>, you’ll notice that the left arm is hanging down. This means that there’s a retargeting issue.

<p>By completing this <a id="_idIndexMarker188"/>exercise, you’ve understood how to import assets and, more specifically, imported an FBX skeletal mesh and animation data into your project. This is crucial for the workflows of many game developers as assets are the building blocks of the entire game.</p>
<p>In the next section, we’ll look at the Unreal core classes for creating a game, how important they are for creating a game or experience, and how to use them inside a project.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>The Unreal Game Mode class</h1>
<p>Consider a situation where<a id="_idIndexMarker189"/> you want to be able to pause your game. All the logic and implementation that’s required to be able to pause the game will be placed inside a single class. This class will be responsible for handling the game flow when a player enters the game. The game flow can be any action or a set of actions that occur in the game. For example, game pause, play, and restart are considered simple game flow actions. Similarly, in the case of a multiplayer game, we require all the network-related gameplay logic to be placed together. This is exactly what the Game Mode class is there for. </p>
<p>Game Mode is a class that drives the game logic and imposes game-related rules on players. It essentially contains information about the current game being played, including gameplay variables and events, which will be mentioned later in this chapter. Game Mode can hold all the managers of the gameplay objects, it’s a singleton class, and it can be accessed by any object or abstract class present in the game.</p>
<p>As with all the other classes, the Game Mode class can be extended in Blueprints or C++. This can be done to include extra functionality and logic that may be required to keep players updated about what’s<a id="_idIndexMarker190"/> happening inside the game. </p>
<p>Let’s go over some example <a id="_idIndexMarker191"/>game logic that goes inside the Game Mode class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limiting the number of players that are allowed to enter the game</li>
<li>Controlling the Spawn location and Player Controller logic of newly connected players</li>
<li>Keeping track of the Game Score</li>
<li>Keeping track of the Game Win/Lose condition</li>
<li>Implementing the Game Over/Restart Game scenario</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next section, we will look at the default classes provided by Game Mode.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Game Mode default classes</h2>
<p>In addition to itself, Game Mode <a id="_idIndexMarker192"/>uses several classes to implement game logic. It allows you to specify classes for its following defaults:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Game Session Class</strong>: Handles admin-level game flow such as login approval.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Game State Class</strong>: Handles the state of the game so that clients can see what’s going on inside the game.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Player Controller Class</strong>: The main class that’s used to possess and control a pawn. It can be thought of as a brain that decides what to do.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Player State Class</strong>: Holds the current state of a player inside the game. </li>
<li><strong class="bold">HUD Class</strong>: Handles the user interface shown to the player.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Default Pawn Class</strong>: The main actor that the player controls. This is essentially the player character. </li>
<li><code>DefaultPawn</code> class, the <code>SpectatorPawn</code> class specifies the pawn responsible for spectating the game.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Replay Spectator Player Controller</strong>: The Player Controller that’s responsible for manipulating the replay during playback, within the game.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Server Stat Replicator Class</strong>: Responsible for replicating server stat net data.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can either use the default classes <a id="_idIndexMarker193"/>as-is or you can specify your own for custom implementation and behavior. These classes will work in conjunction with Game Mode and will automatically run without being placed inside the world.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Gameplay events</h2>
<p>In terms of a multiplayer <a id="_idIndexMarker194"/>game, when many players enter the game, it becomes essential to handle logic to allow them to enter the game and maintain their state, as well as viewing other players’ states and handling their interactions.</p>
<p>Game Mode provides you with several events that can be overridden to handle such multiplayer gameplay logic. The following events are especially useful for networking features and abilities (which they are mostly used for):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>On Post Log In</code>: This event is called after the player is logged into the game successfully. From this point onward, it is safe to call replicated logic (used for networking in multiplayer games) on the <code>Player Controller</code> class.</li>
<li><code>Handle Starting New Player</code>: This event is called after the <code>On Post Log In</code> event and can be used to define what happens to the newly entered player. By default, it creates a pawn for the newly connected player. </li>
<li><code>SpawnDefaultPawnAtTransform</code>: This event triggers the actual pawn spawning within the game. Newly connected players can be spawned at particular transforms or at preset player start positions placed within the level (which can be added by dragging and dropping the <code>Player Start</code> from the <strong class="bold">Models</strong> window into the world).</li>
<li><code>On Logout</code>: This event is called when a player leaves the game or is destroyed. </li>
<li><code>On Restart Player</code>: This event is called to respawn the player. Similar to <code>SpawnDefaultPawnAtTransform</code>, the <a id="_idIndexMarker195"/>player can be respawned at specific transforms or pre-specified locations (using the player start position).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Networking</h2>
<p>The Game Mode class is <a id="_idIndexMarker196"/>not replicated to any clients or joined players. Its scope is only limited to the server where it is spawned. Essentially, the client-server model dictates that the clients only act as inputs within the game that is being played on the server. Therefore, the gameplay logic should not exist for the clients; it should only exist for the server.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>GameModeBase versus Game Mode</h2>
<p>From version 4.14 onward, Epic<a id="_idIndexMarker197"/> introduced the <code>AGameModeBase</code> class, which acts as the parent class for all Game Mode classes. It is essentially a simplified version of the <code>AGameMode</code> class.</p>
<p>However, the Game Mode class contains some additional functionality that is better suited for multiplayer shooter-type games as it implements the <code>Match State</code> concept. By default, the Game Mode Base is included in new template-based projects.</p>
<p>Game Mode also contains a State Machine that handles and keeps track of the player’s state.</p>
<p>Now that you have some understanding of Game Mode and its relevant classes, in the next section, you will learn about levels and the Level Blueprint, and how they tie to the Game Mode class.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Understanding levels and the Level Blueprint</h1>
<p>Levels, in gaming, are sections <a id="_idIndexMarker198"/>or parts of a game. Since many games are quite large, they are broken down into different levels. A level of interest is loaded into the game for the player to play. When they are done with that level, another level may be loaded in (while the current one will be loaded out) so that the player can proceed. To complete a game, a player usually needs to complete a set of specific tasks to move on to the next level, eventually completing the game.</p>
<p>A Game Mode can be directly applied to the level. The level, upon loading, will use the assigned Game Mode class to handle all the logic and gameplay for that particular level and override the game mode of the project for this level. This can be applied using the <strong class="bold">World Settings</strong> tab after opening a level.</p>
<p>A Level Blueprint is a Blueprint that <a id="_idIndexMarker199"/>runs within the level, but cannot be accessed outside the scope of the level. Game Mode can be accessed in any blueprint (including the Level Blueprint) by the <code>Get Game Mode</code> node. This can later be cast to your Game Mode class, to obtain a reference to it.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">A level can only have one Game Mode class assigned to it. However, a single Game Mode class can be assigned to multiple levels to imitate similar functionality and logic.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>The Unreal Pawn class</h2>
<p>The <code>Pawn</code> class, in Unreal, is the most<a id="_idIndexMarker200"/> basic class of actors that can be possessed (either by a player or AI). It also graphically represents the player/bot in the game. Code inside this class should have everything to do with the game entities, including interaction, movement, and ability logic. The player can still only possess a single pawn at any time in the game. Also, the player can <em class="italic">unpossess</em> one pawn and <em class="italic">possess</em> another pawn during gameplay.</p>
<h3>The DefaultPawn class</h3>
<p>Unreal Engine gives<a id="_idIndexMarker201"/> developers a <code>DefaultPawn</code> class (which inherits from the base <code>Pawn</code> class). On top of the <code>Pawn</code> class, this class contains additional code that allows it to move within the world, as you would in the editor version of the game.</p>
<h3>The Spectator Pawn class</h3>
<p>Some games offer <a id="_idIndexMarker202"/>features to spectate games. Let’s say you’re waiting for a friend to finish their game before joining you, so you go ahead and spectate their game. This allows you to observe the game the player is playing, through a camera that you can move around to get a view of the players or the game. Some games also offer spectate modes that can travel back in time, to show a particular action of the game that happened in the past or at any point in the game.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, this is a special type of pawn that provides sample functionality to spectate a game. It contains all the basic tools (such as the Spectator Pawn Movement component) required to do so.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>The Unreal Player Controller class</h2>
<p>The Player Controller class <a id="_idIndexMarker203"/>can be thought of as the player. It is essentially the <em class="italic">soul</em> of a pawn. A Player Controller takes input from the user and feeds it to the pawn and other classes for the player to interact with the game. However, you must take note of the following points while dealing with this class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike the pawn, there can only be one Player Controller that the player represents in a level. (This is just like when you travel in an elevator. While inside one, you can only control that elevator, but you can then exit it and enter another elevator to control that one.)</li>
<li>The Player Controller persists throughout the game, but the pawn may not (for example, in a battle game, the player character may die and respawn, but the Player Controller would remain the same).</li>
<li>Due to the temporary nature of the pawn and the permanent nature of the Player Controller, developers need to keep in mind which code should be added to which class.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s understand this better through the next exercise.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>Exercise 2.04 – setting up the Game Mode, Player Controller, and Pawn classes</h2>

<p>Now<a id="_idIndexMarker219"/> that you know the<a id="_idIndexMarker220"/> basic classes and how they work in Unreal, in the next section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>will look at animations, what processes are involved, and how they complete th<a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>em. We’ll follow this with an exercise.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>Working with animations</h1>
<p>Animation is essential for <a id="_idIndexMarker222"/>adding life and richness to a game. Superb animations are one of the major factors that differentiate average games from the good and the great from the best. Visual fidelity is what keeps gamers excited and immersed in games, and hence animations are a core part of all games and experiences created in Unreal Engine.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">This chapter seeks to cover animation basics. A more in-depth approach to animation will be taken in <a href="B18531_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor222"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a><em class="italic">, Working with Blend Space 1D, Key Bindings, and State Machines</em></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>Animation Blueprints</h2>
<p>An Animation Blueprint is <a id="_idIndexMarker223"/>a specific kind of blueprint that allows you to control the <a id="_idIndexMarker224"/>animation of a Skeletal Mesh. It provides users with a graph specifically for animation-related tasks. Here, you can define the logic for computing the poses of a skeleton. </p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">A Skeletal Mesh is a skeleton-based mesh that contains bones, all of which come together to give form to the <a id="_idIndexMarker225"/>mesh, whereas a Static Mesh (as the name suggests) is an un-animatable mesh. Skeletal Meshes are <a id="_idIndexMarker226"/>normally used for characters and life-like objects (for example, a player hero), whereas Static Meshes are used for basic or lifeless objects (for example, a wall). </p>
<p>Animation Blueprints <a id="_idIndexMarker227"/>provide t<a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>wo kinds of graphs: <code>EventGraph</code> and <code>AnimGraph</code>.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>Event Graph</h2>
<p>The Event Graph within an <a id="_idIndexMarker228"/>Animation Blueprint provides setup events related to<a id="_idIndexMarker229"/> animations, as we learned in <em class="italic">Chapter 1</em>, <em class="italic">Introduction to Unreal Engine</em>, that can be used for variable manipulation and logic. Event graphs are mostly used within Animation Blueprints to update Blend Space values, which, in turn, drive the animations within <code>AnimGraph</code>. The most common events that are used here are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Event Blueprint Initialize Animation</code>: Used to initialize the animation.</li>
<li><code>Event Blueprint Update Animation</code>: This event is executed every frame, allowing developers to perform calculations and update its values as required:</li>
</ul>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.23 – Animation Event Graph " height="584" src="img/Figure_2.23_B18531.jpg" width="686"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.23 – Animation Event Graph</p>
<p>In the preceding screenshot, you <a id="_idIndexMarker230"/>can see the default Event Graph. The <code>Event Blueprint Update Animation</code> and <code>Try Get Pawn Owner</code> nodes are here. You <a id="_idIndexMarker231"/>created new nodes and appended them to a graph to complete some meaningful tasks in <em class="italic">Exercise 2.04 – setting up the<a id="_idTextAnchor078"/> Game Mode, Player Controller, and Pawn classes</em>.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>The Anim Graph</h2>
<p>The Anim Graph is dedicated to and responsible for playing animations and outputting the final pose of the <a id="_idIndexMarker232"/>skeleton on a per-frame basis. It provides developers <a id="_idIndexMarker233"/>with special nodes to execute different logic. For example, the <code>Blend</code> node takes in multiple inputs and is used to decide which input is currently being used in the execution. This decision is usually dependent on some external input (such as an alpha value).</p>
<p>The Anim Graph works by evaluating nodes by following the flow of execution between the exec pins on the nodes being used.</p>
<p>In the following screenshot, you can see a single <code>Output Pose</code> node on the graph. This is the final pose output of the animation that will be visible on the relevant Skeletal Mesh within the game. We will be using this in <em class="italic">Exercise 2.05 – creating a mannequ<a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>in animation</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.24 – Animation AnimGraph " height="400" src="img/Figure_2.24_B18531.jpg" width="763"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.24 – Animation AnimGraph</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>State Machines</h2>
<p>You have already learned <a id="_idIndexMarker234"/>how animation nodes and logic can be set up, but one <a id="_idIndexMarker235"/>essential component is missing. Who decides when a particular animation or piece of logic should play or execute? This is where State Machines come into the picture. For example, a player may need to shift from crouching to a standing pose, so the animation needs to be updated. The code will call the Animation Blueprint, access the State Machine, and let it know that the state of the animation needs to be changed, resulting in a smooth animation transition.</p>
<p>A State Machine consists of states and rules that can be thought of as depicting the state of an animation. A State Machine can always be in one state at a particular time. A transition from one state to another is carried out when certa<a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>in conditions (which are defined by rules) are met.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>Transition Rules</h2>
<p>Each Transition <a id="_idIndexMarker236"/>Rule contains a Boolean <a id="_idIndexMarker237"/>node called <code>Result</code>. If the Boolean is true, the transition can oc<a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>cur and vice versa:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.25 – Transition Rules " height="87" src="img/Figure_2.25_B18531.jpg" width="205"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.25 – Transition Rules</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>Blend Spaces</h2>
<p>When you’re provided <a id="_idIndexMarker238"/>with a bunch of animations, you can create a State <a id="_idIndexMarker239"/>Machine and run those animations. However, a problem is presented when you need to transition from one animation to another. If you simply switch the animation, it will glitch since the new animation’s starting pose might be different from the old animation’s ending pose. </p>
<p>Blend Spaces are special assets that are used to interpolate between different animations based on their alpha values. This, in turn, removes the glitch issue and interpolates between the two animations, causing a swift and smooth change in animation.</p>
<p>Blend Spaces are created either in one dimension, known as a Blend Space 1D, or two dimensions, known as a <a id="_idIndexMarker240"/>Blend Space. These blend any number of <a id="_idTextAnchor086"/>animations <a id="_idIndexMarker241"/>based on one or two input(s), respectively.</p>
<p> Exercise 2.05 – creating a mannequin animation</p>
<p>Now that you’ve gone through<a id="_idIndexMarker242"/> most of the concepts related to animations, we’ll be diving in hands-on by adding some animation logic to the default mannequin. We’ll be creating a Blend Space 1D, a State Machine, and Animation logic.</p>
<p>Our goal here is to create a running animation of our characters and thus gain insight into how animations work, as well as the way they are bound to the actual character in a 3D world. </p>

<p>By completing this exercise, you’ve<a id="_idIndexMarker257"/> understood how to create State Machines, a Blend Space 1D, an Animation Blueprint, and how to tie it all together with the Skeletal Mesh of a character. You’ve also worked on play rates, transitional speed, and the transitional states, helping you understand how the world of animation intricately ties in together.</p>
<p>We kicked off this section by understanding how State Machines are used to represent and transition in-between Animation States. Next, we learned how a Blend Space 1D gives us blending in-between<a id="_idIndexMarker258"/> those transitions. All this is used by the Animation Blueprint to decide what the current animation of the character is. Now<a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>, let’s combine all these concepts in an activity.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>Activity 2.01 – linking animations to a character</h2>
<p>Let’s say, as an Unreal <a id="_idIndexMarker259"/>games developer, you’ve been provided with a character Skeletal Mesh and its animations, and you’ve been tasked with integrating them inside a project. To do that, in this activity, you’ll be creating an Animation <a id="_idIndexMarker260"/>Blueprint, State Machines, and a Blend Space 1D of a new character. By completing this activity, you should be able to work with animations in Unreal Engine and link them to Skeletal Meshes. </p>
<p>This activity’s project folder contains a <code>Ganfault</code>. </p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">This character and its animations were downloaded from <a href="http://mixamo.com">mixamo.com</a>. These have been placed in the <code>Content</code> |<code>Ganfault</code> folder of this book’s GitHub repository: <a href="https://packt.live/35eCGrk">https://packt.live/35eCGrk</a>.</p>
<p class="callout"><em class="italic">Mixamo.com</em> is a website that sells 3D characters with animations and is sort of an asset marketplace for 3D models. It also contains a library of free models, alongside the paid ones.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to complete this activity:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Create a Blend Space 1D for the Walking/Running animation and set up the Animation Blueprint.</li>
<li>Next, go to <code>Content</code> | <code>ThirdPersonBP</code> | <code>Blueprints</code> and open the <code>ThirdPersonCharacter</code> Blueprint.</li>
<li>Click the Skeletal Mesh component on the left and, inside the <code>SkeletalMesh</code> reference with <code>Ganfault</code>.</li>
<li>Similarly, update the <code>Ganfault</code>. </li>
</ol>
<p class="callout-heading">Note </p>
<p class="callout">For the State Machine, only implement Idle/Run and Jump State.</p>
<p>Once you’ve <a id="_idIndexMarker261"/>completed this activity, the Walk/Run and Jump <a id="_idIndexMarker262"/>animations should be working properly, as shown in the following output:</p>

<p>By completing this activity, you now know how to navigate Unreal Engine for the project, debug code, and work with animations. You also understand State Machines, which represent transitions <a id="_idIndexMarker263"/>between the Animation States and the <a id="_idIndexMarker264"/>Blend Spaces 1D that are used in that transition. You can now add animation to 3D models based on gameplay events and inputs. </p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we learned how to create an empty project. Then, we learned about the folder structure and how to organize files in the project directory. After that, we looked at template-based projects. We learned how to set breakpoints in code so that we can watch variable values and debug entire objects while the game is running, which would help us find and eradicate bugs in our code.</p>
<p>Thereafter, we saw how Game Mode, Player Pawn, and Player Controller are relevant classes that are used in Unreal Engine for setting up game flows (the execution order of code), as well as how they are set up inside a project.</p>
<p>Finally, we looked at animation basics and worked with State Machines, Blend Spaces 1D, and Animation Blueprints to make our character animate (walk/run and jump) within the game according to the keyboard input.</p>
<p>Throughout this chapter, we became more familiar with the powerful tools in Unreal Engine that are essential for game development. Unreal’s Game Mode and its default classes are required to make any kind of game or experience in Unreal Engine. Additionally, animations bring life to your character and help add layers of immersion to your games. All game studios have animations, characters, and game logic since these are the core components that drive any game. These skills will help you numerous times throughout your game development journey.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will talk about the <code>Character</code> class in Unreal Engine, its components, and how to extend the class for additional setup. You’ll be working on various exercises, followed by an activity.</p>
