- en: In this book, we will explore all the important elements of C such as strings,
    arrays, one-and two-dimensional arrays, functions, pointers, file handling, threads,
    interprocess communication, and database handling. Through the cookbook approach,
    you will find solutions to different problems that you will usually come across
    while making applications. By the end of the book, you will have sufficient knowledge
    to use some low- as well as high-level features of the C language and the ability
    to apply them for making real-time applications.

- en: This book is meant for basic to intermediate programmers and developers who
    want to make complex and real-time applications in C. This book can be of great
    use to trainers, teachers, and software developers who get stuck while making
    applications with arrays, pointers, functions, structures, files, databases, and
    interprocess communication and wish to see a running examples to find the way
    out of the problem.

- en: '[Chapter 1](3fd2bfb0-da67-467d-9986-c66c9bdcf736.xhtml), *Working with Arrays*,
    explains how to do some complex but essential operations with arrays. You will
    learn how to insert an element in an array, multiply two matrices, find the common
    elements in two arrays, and also find the difference between two sets or arrays.
    Also, you will learn how to find the unique elements in an array, how to know
    whether a matrix is a sparse matrix or not, and how to merge two sorted arrays
    into one array.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](d3f17a83-f91b-4831-81b4-107b3eb19092.xhtml), *Managing Strings*,
    covers manipulating strings at the character level. You will learn how to work
    out whether the given string is a palindrome or not, how to find the first repetitive
    character in a string, and how to count each character in a string. You will also
    learn how to count the number of vowels and consonants in a string and the procedure
    of converting the vowels in a sentence into uppercase.'

    covers functions, which play a major role in breaking down a big application into
    small, independent, manageable modules. In this chapter, you will learn how to
    make a function that finds whether the supplied argument is an Armstrong number.
    You will also learn how a function returns an array, and we make a function that
    finds the **greatest common divisor** (**GCD**) of two numbers using recursion.
    You will also learn how to make a function that converts a binary number into
    hexadecimal and how to make a function that determines whether the supplied number
    is a palindrome or not.'

    explains how to use pointers to access content from specific memory locations.
    You will learn how to reverse a string using pointers, how to find the largest
    value in an array using pointers, and how to sort a singly linked list. Besides
    this, the chapter also explains how to find the transpose of a matrix and how
    to access a structure using pointers.'

    that file handling is very important for storing data for later use. In this chapter,
    you will learn how to read a text file and convert all the characters after full
    stops into uppercase. You will also learn how to display the content of a random
    file in reverse order and how to count the number of vowels in a file. This chapter
    will also explain how to replace a word in a file with another word and how to
    keep your file secure from unauthorized access. You will also learn how a file
    is encrypted.'

    covers concurrency, which is implemented to increase the efficiency of the CPU.
    In this chapter, you will learn how to do a task using a single thread. Also,
    you will learn how to do multiple tasks with multiple threads and the technique
    of sharing data on two threads using a `mutex`. Besides this, you will learn how
    to recognize situations in which a deadlock can arise and how it can be avoided.'

    Communication*, focuses on explaining how to establish communication between processes.
    You will learn how to communicate between processes using pipes, establish communication
    between processes using FIFO, and how communication is established between the
    client and server using socket programming. You will also learn how to do interprocess
    communication using the UDP socket, how a message is passed from one process to
    another using the message queue, and how two processes communicate using shared
    memory.'

    explains that no real-time application is possible without storing information
    in a database. The information in a database needs to be managed. In this chapter,
    you will learn how to display all the built-in tables in a default MySQL database.
    You will learn how to store information in a MySQL database and how to search
    for information in database tables. You will also learn how to update information
    in database tables and how to delete data from the database when it''s no longer
    required.'

    Most of the recipes in [Chapter 5](947d4b9d-0441-43af-86c1-270d385a9fd0.xhtml), *File
    Handling,* are about reading content from a file, and those recipes assume that
    the file already exists. This chapter explains how to create a sequential file
    and enter some text in it. You will also learn how to read content from a sequential
    file. Besides this, you will learn how to create a random file and enter some
    content in it, and how to read content from a random file and display it on the
    screen. Finally, you will also learn how to decrypt the content of an encrypted
    file.'
