- en: Using the knowledge of 3D graphics programming that we gained in the previous
    section, we can now build on it to develop a basic project with Vulkan. OpenGL
    is a high-level graphics library. There are a lot things that OpenGL does in the
    background that the user is generally not aware of. With Vulkan, we will see the
    inner workings of a graphics library. We will see the why and the how of creating
    SwapChains, image views, renderpasses, Framebuffers, command buffers, as well
    as rendering and presenting objects to a scene.
