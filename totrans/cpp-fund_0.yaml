- en: '*C++ Fundamentals* begins by introducing you to the C++ compilation model and
    syntax. You will then study data types, variable declaration, scope and control
    flow statements. With the help of this book, you''ll be able to compile fully
    working C++ code and understand how variables, references, and pointers can be
    used to manipulate the state of the program. Next, you will explore functions
    and classes — the features that C++ offers to organize a program — and use them
    to solve more complex problems. You will also understand common pitfalls and modern
    best practices, especially the ones that diverge from the C++98 guidelines.'

- en: As you advance through the chapters, you'll study the advantages of generic
    programming and write your own templates to make generic algorithms that work
    with any type. This C++ book will guide you in fully exploiting standard containers
    and algorithms, understanding how to pick the appropriate one for each problem.

    but also be equipped to improve the readability, performance, and maintainability
    of your programs.
