<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
<p>This book is designed for experienced computer graphics software engineers who might be well versed in older graphics APIs such as OpenGL and DirectX 10 but are relatively new to modern graphics APIs. Like you, we found ourselves needing to learn Vulkan but struggling to implement practical solutions because we didn’t understand the basic concepts of Vulkan, which is, in itself, a complicated and vast API. The goal of this book is to introduce you to the essential concepts of the API and then walk you through hand-picked, tried-and-true algorithms that show you the new and nuanced aspects of Vulkan in each recipe.</p>
<p>This book is divided into five parts and covers, in this order, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic Vulkan concepts, how and why to use them, and how they fit into the bigger picture of writing an application using the Vulkan API</li>
<li>General graphics algorithms implemented using Vulkan, including their features and how they can be used to achieve all sorts of tasks relevant to graphics applications</li>
<li>Using Vulkan to build a GPU ray tracer and a hybrid renderer</li>
<li>How to use Vulkan and OpenXR to write applications for the incredible new world of VR, MR, and AR</li>
<li>Ways to debug and profile your Vulkan implementation</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many resources that cover the first part of what this book explores, but in this book, we offer a two-part story that progressively helps you understand the basic Vulkan concepts by providing easy and practical examples. The subsequent parts present implementations that work and can be used as a reference for the implementation of your own graphics engine.</p>
<p>The main goal of the repository provided with this book was not to achieve the highest performance, find clever ways to implement things, or even implement the shiniest new algorithm shown at last year’s GDC or SIGGRAPH. It was simplicity and completeness. We offer tips and tricks on how some Vulkan features can and/or must be used, and most recipes have been tested and debugged and provide you with a self-contained working solution that you can improve and use in your own code base. Each recipe is its own executable and can be inspected independently from the others, making them easy to read. That also makes it easy to understand all the details of each algorithm from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Vulkan is the future de-facto graphics API for all devices and types of applications. It’s a mature, feature-rich, and maintained API, supported by all GPU vendors, operating systems, frameworks, and languages. If you intend to write graphics applications or write one that uses only the compute facilities of Vulkan, getting to know the API is a must, and you need to learn it right now!</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book has been written for experienced graphics software engineers who would like to learn more about Vulkan. Knowing at least one other graphics API, such as OpenGL, and one of its variants, such as WebGL, OpenGL ES, or DirectX (up to version 9 or 10), is suggested but not strictly necessary. It is important to know graphics principles, such as transformations, graphics pipelines, shaders, lighting, the basics of ray tracing, and depth and stencil buffers, to name a few. More advanced topics, such as PBR and all its concepts, aren’t necessary but may be helpful.</p>
<p>Finally, the code has been written entirely in C++, as it is the most widely used programming language for writing graphics applications. Even though some C++20 features are used in the book because they help reduce Vulkan’s verbosity, you are not expected to have intimate knowledge of the newest C++ features.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
<p><a href="B18491_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor019"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Vulkan Core Concepts</em>, provides a walk-through of the most basic Vulkan concepts and objects and how to create and use them. The chapter covers how Vulkan can be used and initialized and how its objects interplay and are managed from the application. At the end of the chapter, we present a recipe for how those concepts can be used to create the simplest graphics application in Vulkan.</p>
<p><a href="B18491_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor126"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Working with Modern Vulkan</em>, presents more advanced Vulkan concepts and objects, such as barriers, descriptors, and pipelines, that allow you to start using resources other than just data provided directly in the shader code. This chapter also offers a brief overview of modern rendering techniques, such as <strong class="bold">Programmable Vertex Pulling</strong> (<strong class="bold">PVP</strong>) and <strong class="bold">Multidraw </strong><strong class="bold">Indirect</strong> (<strong class="bold">MDI</strong>).</p>
<p><a href="B18491_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor217"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing GPU-Driven Rendering</em>, has recipes that implement what is called GPU-driven rendering: techniques that generate data directly from shaders with little or no input from the CPU. The generated data remains in the GPU after being generated and can be used to direct how to render a scene; or, the data can be presented directly on screen as debug information.</p>
<p><a href="B18491_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor241"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Exploring Techniques for Lighting, Shading, and Shadows</em>, explores known graphics techniques but from a Vulkan perspective. Recipes include implementations of deferred rendering, screen-space reflections, shadow maps, and screen-space ambient occlusion, demonstrating how to achieve practical results while navigating the complexity of Vulkan.</p>
<p><a href="B18491_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor264"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deciphering Order-Independent Transparency</em>, contains recipes for implementing transparency using Vulkan, all the way from simpler algorithms, such as depth-peeling and dual depth-peeling, to more advanced and physically correct implementations, such as order-independent transparency, that run exclusively on the GPU. While some of those recipes may seem old, they really show the power of the Vulkan API.</p>
<p><a href="B18491_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor283"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Anti-Aliasing Techniques</em>, provides a comprehensive list of anti-aliasing techniques that can be used with Vulkan. The first recipe uses the multisample anti-aliasing feature provided by Vulkan, while the others offer alternate ways to provide antialiasing without using the facilities provided by the API.</p>
<p><a href="B18491_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor299"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Ray Tracing and Hybrid Rendering</em>, is an introduction to ray tracing with Vulkan and uses the new Vulkan ray tracing extensions. Most of the chapter will walk you through how to implement a path tracer in your application and use it to render a ray-traced scene and display it on screen. The chapter spends the last few pages demonstrating how to use a hybrid approach in your existing rasterization engine to make it pop with a few ray-traced features.</p>
<p><a href="B18491_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor310"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Extended Reality with OpenXR</em>, introduces you to the realm of extended reality, which encompasses virtual, mixed, and augmented reality. The chapter introduces OpenXR, including its main features and how to use it. The chapter then explains how to improve your rendering engine’s performance using Vulkan and OpenXR features, such as multiview rendering and dynamic foveation.</p>
<p><a href="B18491_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor333"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Debugging and Performance Measurement Techniques</em>, concludes the book by guiding you through some ways to debug your Vulkan application and how to measure its performance.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
<p>You will need a computer with a recent graphics card (to use some of the newer extensions, such as ray tracing, for example, you will need a card equivalent to NVIDIA’s 3050). The code in the repository and in this book has been compiled and tested with Visual Studio 2022 and the Vulkan SDK 1.3.268.</p>
