    easier it became to identify the various parts that were on the circuit boards.
    It was a lot harder, however, to figure out how all the parts worked together.
    While it was possible to take electronic devices apart and put them back together
    without a basic understanding of the circuit, it was impossible to figure out
    how the devices actually worked. Once I understood how circuits worked, not only
    was I able to begin to understand how the electronic devices worked but I was
    also able to build simple circuits on my own.

    2](48ede881-c312-454b-8351-06f6a4734c52.xhtml), *Basic Electronics* we described
    electrical current as the flow of electrons. The circuit is the path in which
    these electrons flow, powering the components that make up the circuit. The point
    where the electrons enter the circuit, and the current starts, is called the **source**.
    The point where the electrons exit the circuit is called the **return**. Everything
    between the source and the return, the components and wires that make up the remainder
    of the circuit, is called the **load**.

    hardware. This software is designed in the same spirit as the Arduino where it
    abstracts away the complexity of diagramming the circuit, so the user can focus
    on the design itself. There will be a **Fritzing sketch** in the downloadable
    code, for all projects in this book. A Fritzing sketch is a project within the
    Fritzing application that represents the circuit being created. These projects
    can contain both circuit diagrams and code if the project includes a microcontroller
    like the Arduino. We will not be using the coding section of Fritzing in this
    book and instead will use the standard Arduino IDE, but it is good to know it

    circuits. A series circuit is a circuit where current only has one path to flow
    from the source to the return. A parallel circuit is a circuit that has multiple
    paths for the current flow. It is important to understand both types of circuits

    batteries (1.5 volts each) in series, rather than the 9-volt battery, we would
    have a total voltage of 6 volts because 1.5V + 1.5V + 1.5V + 1.5V would equal

    branch and the 330-ohm resistor branch.

    with Ohm's law we use the formula *I*=*V*/*R*, which means the current equals
    the voltage divided by the resistance. Earlier, in the resistance section, we
    calculated that the resistance in the circuit was 132 ohms and we know that the
    voltage is 9 volts, therefore, the total current will equal 9 volts/132 ohms or
    0.0682 amps (68.2 milliamps).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the voltage for each branch will be the same 9 volts. The current in the branch
    that contains the 220-ohm resistor would be 9 volts/220 ohms or 0.0409 amps (40.9
    milliamps). The current in the branch with the 330-ohm resistor would be 9 volts/330
    ohms or 0.0273 amps (27.3 milliamps).

    to the current from the branch that contains the 330-ohm resistor to get the total

    coming out of the power source.
