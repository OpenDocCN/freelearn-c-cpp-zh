			<h1 id="_idParaDest-358"><a id="_idTextAnchor756"/>What Next?</h1>
			<p>What a journey! We went from knowing nothing about programming to having an intermediate understanding and creating a whole game from scratch within one book. I know that it isn’t always easy to understand everything on the first go, but that is how we learn. We have to fail at something and try it over and over – each time getting better at the thing we are trying <span class="No-Break">to learn.</span></p>
			<p>Starting a new project is always a struggle. It’s like the white canvas of a painter or the blank page of a writer. Starting something new is hard. That is why I like to provide some ideas to get you started. And don’t worry about what project is the ideal one. From here on out, any project that interests you is a good one to try out. Just make sure to keep them small and finish them so that people can play what you <span class="No-Break">have made.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following <span class="No-Break">main topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ideas for your <span class="No-Break">next project</span></li>
				<li>Learning <span class="No-Break">new topics</span></li>
				<li>Joining <span class="No-Break">the community</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-359"><a id="_idTextAnchor757"/>Ideas for your next projects</h1>
			<p>As mentioned in the introduction of this chapter, the fear of an empty project is a real thing. Where to begin and what to make is always a struggle. Let’s take a closer look at <span class="No-Break">both problems.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-360"><a id="_idTextAnchor758"/>Starting a new project</h2>
			<p>Here are some tips I learned the <a id="_idIndexMarker870"/>hard way about starting a new project that will help you focus on creating the game you want <span class="No-Break">to create:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Start by creating the main gameplay loop</strong>: The first thing you should do is create the gameplay on which the game is based. If you are creating a platformer, make sure that moving and jumping around is fun to do on its own before you start adding more <span class="No-Break">intricate systems.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Make it functional before you make it beautiful</strong>: It’s easy to get lost in making your game overly beautiful, but this will slow down the production of the game significantly. Even worse, if the game is not fun and you need to redo a lot of systems, you’ll also need to redo all the things you did to make <span class="No-Break">it beautiful.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Focus on the thing you want to learn</strong>: If there is a specific topic you want to learn about, such as menus and the UI, then make this the focus of your project. There are more UI-focused game genres, such as visual novels or strategy games, that you <span class="No-Break">can make.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Keep it small</strong>: Most people appreciate playing a small, fun game more than a long, half-baked experience. This will also make sure that you’ll be able to finish the game. Any game you ever played was finished (or deemed finished enough), while the unfinished ones were never played <span class="No-Break">by anyone.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Make a GDD</strong>: At the start of a project, create a short game design document. This could be a one-pager, just to state the general intentions of the project. It will guide you while <a id="_idIndexMarker871"/>developing and help make decisions <span class="No-Break">later on.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These were some high-level tips on how to tackle any new project. It’s easy to get caught up in the details, so the most important thing is to just begin. Learning happens when we make mistakes, after all. We’ll now move on to more concrete ideas of what to <span class="No-Break">do next.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-361"><a id="_idTextAnchor759"/>Extending the survivor-like game</h2>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker872"/>logical next step is to extend the game we create throughout this book. Some ideas could be <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Introducing new enemy type<a id="_idTextAnchor760"/>s</strong>: Maybe an enemy that is slow but deals a lot of damage, or a bomb that stays in place and explodes after <span class="No-Break">5 seconds.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Creating different projectile types</strong>: Maybe a dagger that has a shorter range but deals more damage <span class="No-Break">to enemies.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Adding more items to pick up</strong>: Maybe a shield that protects the player for five seconds, or boots that make the player move <span class="No-Break">around faster.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>However, one warning I<a id="_idIndexMarker873"/> have for you is that you should not stay on one project for too long. When learning to create and design games, it is best to keep projects small and not over-polish a single game. It is often better to consider something as done, let people play it, and then move on to the next project – this is until you feel confident enough in your skills to tackle a <span class="No-Break">bigger game.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Polish in video games</p>
			<p class="callout">In video game development, we call anything that is not the core experience of the game <strong class="bold">polish </strong>– things that are not integral to the experience, but make it look nicer or feel smoother. Polish is very important for the final experience of <span class="No-Break">the game.</span></p>
			<p>On the subject of creating many smaller games, let’s look at some game ideas you could work <span class="No-Break">on next.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-362"><a id="_idTextAnchor761"/>Creating another game</h2>
			<p>In the game developer community, we often say <em class="italic">your first 10 games will suck</em>, which is a harsh way to say that the first 10 projects you create will not be great. And that’s OK. We have all been there. But every project you get under your belt will teach <span class="No-Break">you something.</span></p>
			<p>Maybe you’ll focus on creating an engaging gameplay loop in one project, while focusing on creating clear menus <span class="No-Break">in another.</span></p>
			<p>Try to make many small projects, each of which teaches you something useful; this way, you will be able to grow your skills while also having something to show <span class="No-Break">for it.</span></p>
			<p>Some game ideas you could try to tackle next are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">A platformer</strong>: Learn how to <a id="_idIndexMarker874"/>work with 2D physics where gravity pulls the <span class="No-Break">player down.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">A turn-based strategy game</strong>: Learn<a id="_idIndexMarker875"/> how to divide gameplay up into <span class="No-Break">discrete steps.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">A card game</strong>: Learn<a id="_idIndexMarker876"/> how to work with a more intricate UI and how to abstract <span class="No-Break">card abilities.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">A puzzle game</strong>: Learn <a id="_idIndexMarker877"/>how to design interesting puzzles that are not too hard or <span class="No-Break">too easy.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">A visual novel</strong>: Learn<a id="_idIndexMarker878"/> all about menus and how to integrate dialog into <span class="No-Break">a game.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">An endless runner</strong>: Learn how<a id="_idIndexMarker879"/> to generate random levels on <span class="No-Break">the fly.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>While working on one of these projects, look up the parts you don’t know how to do or don’t understand. The information in this book is a great starting point, but it won’t suffice to solve everything. A book that would try to do that would be <span class="No-Break">unwieldy long.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-363"><a id="_idTextAnchor762"/>Free game assets</h2>
			<p>If you are not a visual <a id="_idIndexMarker880"/>artist or musician, then creating assets to put in your game can be hard. Luckily, there are many free options around; check out <span class="No-Break">these links:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Kenney</strong>: An awesome free 2D, 3D, and audio asset created in the Netherlands. The sprites used in this book<a id="_idIndexMarker881"/> come from <span class="No-Break">Kenney: </span><a href="https://kenney.nl/assets"><span class="No-Break">https://kenney.nl/assets</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">OpenGameArt</strong>: A <a id="_idIndexMarker882"/>community of game developers and artists providing free and open source <span class="No-Break">assets: </span><a href="https://opengameart.org/"><span class="No-Break">https://opengameart.org/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Itch.io</strong>: The <a id="_idIndexMarker883"/>platform we used to published our game on is also a great resource for free assets of all <span class="No-Break">kinds: </span><a href="https://itch.io/game-assets/free"><span class="No-Break">https://itch.io/game-assets/free</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>With these, you’ll be able to make a beautiful game in <span class="No-Break">no time.</span></p>
			<p>Even though these assets are free, it is often required to credit the creator of the assets somewhere in the game or on the game’s store page. So, don’t forget to do that; this way, you get free assets and they get exposure. <span class="No-Break">Everyone wins!</span></p>
			<p>Knowing what to learn is the first step, which you hopefully identify while doing the projects suggested in this section. From there, the question is, how do we learn these things? Let’s look at that in the <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-364"><a id="_idTextAnchor763"/>Learning about new topics</h1>
			<p>There are many great resources out there to learn more about programming and game design. In this section, we’ll go over some different types of resources that could help <span class="No-Break">you out.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-365"><a id="_idTextAnchor764"/>Following specific tutorials</h2>
			<p>When you know what you would like to learn, there will most certainly be a tutorial on that topic in video or text format. All you need to do is use your favorite search engine, such as Google or YouTube, and search for whatever topic you are looking for. Some of my favorite sources of great Godot Engine tutorials<a id="_idIndexMarker884"/> are <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">GDQuest</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker885"/>provides great video tutorials on a wide variety of topics and even provides whole <span class="No-Break">courses: </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Gdquest"><span class="No-Break">https://www.youtube.com/@Gdquest</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Hearbeast</strong>: A YouTube channel with complete game projects but also shorter tutorials on different <a id="_idIndexMarker886"/>Godot Engine-related <span class="No-Break">topics: </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@uheartbeast"><span class="No-Break">https://www.youtube.com/@uheartbeast</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">The Godot Engine docs</strong>: There is a <a id="_idIndexMarker887"/>whole page in the documentation that introduces different third-party <span class="No-Break">tutorials: </span><a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/community/tutorials.html"><span class="No-Break">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/community/tutorials.html</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">KidsCanCode</strong>: This has many <a id="_idIndexMarker888"/>great articles on a variety of Godot-related <span class="No-Break">topics: </span><a href="https://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/4.x/"><span class="No-Break">https://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/4.x/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Game Maker’s Toolkit</strong>: A channel <a id="_idIndexMarker889"/>with great video essays about game design:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GMTK"><span class="No-Break">https://www.youtube.com/@GMTK</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>There is no shortage of online tutorials on the <span class="No-Break">Godot Engine.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-366"><a id="_idTextAnchor765"/>Reading more books</h2>
			<p>Another way to deepen your knowledge is by reading other books on more specialized and advanced topics. Here are some of <span class="No-Break">my favorites:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><em class="italic">The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses</em>, by Jesse Schell. This book is a very thorough introduction to everything <span class="No-Break">game design-related.</span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">Game Programming Patterns</em>, by Robert Nystrom. Want to learn more about the programming patterns applied in games? Then this is the book <span class="No-Break">for you.</span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">Theory of Fun for Game Design</em>, by Raph Koster. A short book about what makes games fun and their <span class="No-Break">cultural importance.</span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">Godot 4 Game Development Projects</em>, by <span class="No-Break">Chris Bradfield.</span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">GAMEDEV: 10 Steps to Making Your First Game Successful</em>, by <span class="No-Break">Wlad Marhulets.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Any of these will help you on your way to becoming a game developer <span class="No-Break">and designer.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-367"><a id="_idTextAnchor766"/>Reading the Godot Engine documentation</h2>
			<p>Next to third-party<a id="_idIndexMarker890"/> resources, there is, of course, also the official <strong class="bold">Godot Engine documentation</strong>. This is a very exhaustive source of information on all the different classes and nodes and contains manuals on all the different subsystems related to <span class="No-Break">the engine.</span></p>
			<p>You can access the <a id="_idIndexMarker891"/>documentation <span class="No-Break">here: </span><a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/"><span class="No-Break">https://docs.godotengine.org/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Whenever you search for how to use a certain part of the engine, you should start by consulting <span class="No-Break">the documentation.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-368"><a id="_idTextAnchor767"/>Looking at the game code of other people’s projects</h2>
			<p>A great way to learn is by looking at other people’s game projects and code. Because the Godot Engine is an open source project, many games with the engine are open source too. This means that the full project is available online for anyone to see and play <span class="No-Break">around with.</span></p>
			<p>Some great projects include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Godot Engine demo projects</strong>: These <a id="_idIndexMarker892"/>are fully open source, small projects that range from tech demos to full <span class="No-Break">games: </span><a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects"><span class="No-Break">https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">GDQuest’s open RPG</strong>: A demo <a id="_idIndexMarker893"/>of a 2D, open-world RPG <span class="No-Break">game: </span><a href="https://github.com/gdquest-demos/godot-open-rpg"><span class="No-Break">https://github.com/gdquest-demos/godot-open-rpg</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Note that these projects are often still under development or could have been made with an older Godot Engine version, but it doesn’t hurt to take a look how people solved <span class="No-Break">certain problems.</span></p>
			<p>Learning new topics is a great way to improve your game development; it will allow you to do more, faster. However, another important, yet overlooked, way to improve is by joining a community of like-minded people who love sharing, giving feedback, and supporting each other. Let’s have a look at how we could join such <span class="No-Break">a community.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-369"><a id="_idTextAnchor768"/>Joining the community</h1>
			<p>Lastly, I would want to encourage you to join the game development community. In general, it is a very welcoming and friendly bunch of people who love to hear from you and your games. Don’t hesitate to approach people and ask them questions. Most people are very helpful and will encourage you on <span class="No-Break">your journey.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-370"><a id="_idTextAnchor769"/>Joining the Forum, Discord, Reddit, or any other platform</h2>
			<p>There are many different communities that have sprung up related to creating games on many different platforms. It doesn’t matter what social media you are most active on; there is likely a lively game developer community based there. Here are some of the outlets you <span class="No-Break">can join:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">The official Godot Engine Forum</strong>: It’s the perfect place to ask questions, help out others, and <a id="_idIndexMarker894"/>show off your <span class="No-Break">projects: </span><a href="https://forum.godotengine.org/"><span class="No-Break">https://forum.godotengine.org/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">The official Godot Engine Discord</strong>: Here, you can encounter like-minded game developers who <a id="_idIndexMarker895"/>work with <span class="No-Break">Godot: </span><a href="https://discord.com/invite/4JBkykG"><span class="No-Break">https://discord.com/invite/4JBkykG</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Godot Engine Reddit</strong>: Here, you <a id="_idIndexMarker896"/>can share your project and look at other people’s <span class="No-Break">progress: </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/"><span class="No-Break">https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Godot developers on Twitch</strong>: If you’re into streaming or watching streamers, then <a id="_idIndexMarker897"/>there is a <strong class="source-inline">Godot</strong> tag you could check <span class="No-Break">out: </span><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/all/tags/godot"><span class="No-Break">https://www.twitch.tv/directory/all/tags/godot</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Any of the social platforms</strong>: Many people post on social platforms such as <strong class="bold">Instagram</strong>, <strong class="bold">Twitter</strong>, <strong class="bold">Mastodon</strong>, <strong class="bold">Blusesky</strong>, or <strong class="bold">TikTok</strong>. Just look under the <strong class="source-inline">#GodotEngine</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">#IndieDev</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">#</strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">GameDev</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> hashtags.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Sharing your progress, seeing other people’s progress, and discussing game development with others can be a very motivating and satisfying way of building a little community <span class="No-Break">around you.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-371"><a id="_idTextAnchor770"/>Contributing to the Godot Engine project</h2>
			<p>Because the Godot Engine is <a id="_idIndexMarker898"/>open source and you now know how to work with it, you can help out, if you want to. Here are some of the ways in which you could <span class="No-Break">do so:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Log issues</strong>: The Godot Engine, like any piece of software, is unfortunately not without its bugs, but there are a lot of people solving them. If you find a bug in the engine, you can always open an issue on the GitHub page for the <span class="No-Break">engine: </span><a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues"><span class="No-Break">https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Write documentation</strong>: Whenever you are reading the documentation and you feel like it is a bit lacking on the page you are on, don’t hesitate to add your own improvements and help out anyone else who is new to the Godot Engine. There is a link on every documentation page that will take you directly to where you can edit <span class="No-Break">the page.</span></li>

			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Translate parts of the engine</strong>: Want to help localize the engine or its documentation to other languages so that more people have access to this great tool? If so, you’ll find everything you need to know <span class="No-Break">here: </span><a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/documentation/editor_and_docs_localization.html#doc-editor-and-docs-localization"><span class="No-Break">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/documentation/editor_and_docs_localization.html#doc-editor-and-docs-localization</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Contribute code to the engine directly</strong>: Once you feel confident enough in your coding abilities, you can give coding directly in the core of the engine a shot. You can find more <a id="_idIndexMarker899"/>information <span class="No-Break">here: </span><a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/development/index.html"><span class="No-Break">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/development/index.html</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are some of the biggest ways you can contribute back to the Godot project and community. Let’s now return to creating games in the <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-372"><a id="_idTextAnchor771"/>Joining a game jam</h2>
			<p>A big part of being a game developer is, of course, developing games. And nothing is more fun than to develop games with others. That is exactly <a id="_idIndexMarker900"/>what <strong class="bold">game jams</strong> are for. Game jams are events where you create a game from scratch over a small period of time, often a weekend, but it can go up to a month <span class="No-Break">or more.</span></p>
			<p>The goal is to create a little game that is then played by the other participants of the jam. This is a great way to get lots of feedback and play the games of many other people during the jam. What’s more, you can enter these jams with a team. This way, you create connections within the game development world and learn to work with multiple people on something. However, you can also just participate on <span class="No-Break">your own.</span></p>
			<p>One of the biggest platforms that provide game jams is <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a>, which we used to upload our game in <a href="B19358_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor689"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></span></a>. Just visit <a href="https://itch.io/jams">https://itch.io/jams</a> and look for a game jam that interests you. There are <a id="_idIndexMarker901"/>always many game jams going on at any given point <span class="No-Break">in time.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer319">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.2 - The game jams page on Itch.io</p>
			<p>Some great jams that you could join are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Godot Wild Jam</strong>: A <a id="_idIndexMarker902"/>monthly game jam specifically for Godot game <span class="No-Break">developers: </span><a href="https://godotwildjam.com/"><span class="No-Break">https://godotwildjam.com/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Global Game Jam</strong>: A <a id="_idIndexMarker903"/>physical game jam organized globally. Check out the site to find a location near <span class="No-Break">you: </span><a href="https://globalgamejam.org/"><span class="No-Break">https://globalgamejam.org/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">The GMTK Game Jam</strong>: A yearly<a id="_idIndexMarker904"/> game jam organized by the <strong class="bold">Game Developer’s Toolkit</strong> YouTube channel. This one doesn’t have a stable website linked to it, but it’s always announced on the YouTube <span class="No-Break">channel: </span><a href="mailto:https://www.youtube.com/@GMTK"><span class="No-Break">https://www.youtube.com/@GMTK</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now, you know how to integrate yourself into the game developer’s community and start sharing your awesome games with thousands of other <span class="No-Break">like-minded people.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-373"><a id="_idTextAnchor772"/>Goodbyes</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we concluded the book by showing you what is next on your journey to creating great games. We saw what possible projects we could work on next, how to learn new things, and how to join <span class="No-Break">the community.</span></p>
			<p>The intention of this whole book was to get new people to start creating games in the Godot Engine. We went from knowing absolutely nothing about programming or game development to a very solid and intermediate understanding <span class="No-Break">of both.</span></p>
			<p>At the start, we learned how to us GDScript as our language of choice, learning about the basic concepts, such as variables and loops, and progressing to more intermediate topics, such as classes and proper programming guidelines. We eventually made our way to advanced topics, such as the super keyword and <span class="No-Break">programming patterns.</span></p>
			<p>During the book, we also developed our own game, a small survival game modeled after <em class="italic">Vampire Survivors</em>. We saw what nodes are and which ones we should use in all kinds of different situations. We even made the game multiplayer and published it<a id="_idIndexMarker905"/> on <strong class="bold">Itch.io</strong>, ready to be played by anyone who would like to <span class="No-Break">do so!</span></p>
			<p>I hope you had a great time learning how to program and use the Godot Engine, and I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for sticking around until the end. Now go out there and create some <span class="No-Break">awesome games!</span></p>
