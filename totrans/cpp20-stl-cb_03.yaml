    a *container* is an object that contains a collection of other objects, or *elements*.
    The STL provides a complete suite of container types that form the foundation
    of the STL itself.

    in sequence. While you may use the elements sequentially, some of these containers
    use contiguous storage, and others do not. The STL includes these sequential containers:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `array` is a fixed-size sequence that holds a specific number of elements
    in contiguous storage. Once allocated, it cannot change size. This is the simplest
    and fastest contiguous storage container.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `vector` is like an array that can shrink and grow. Its elements are stored
    contiguously, so changing size may involve the expense of allocating memory and
    moving data. A `vector` may keep extra space in reserve to mitigate that cost.
    Inserting and deleting elements from anywhere other than the *back* of a `vector`
    will trigger realignment of the elements to maintain contiguous storage.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `list` is a doubly-linked list structure that allows elements to be inserted
    and deleted in constant (*O(1)*) time. Traversing the list happens in linear *O(n)*
    time. A single-linked variant is available as `forward_list`, which only iterates
    forward. A `forward_list` uses less space and is somewhat more efficient than
    a doubly-linked `list`, but lacks some capability.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to its elements, much like a `vector`, but does not guarantee contiguous storage.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `set` is an associative container where each element is also its own key.
    Elements are ordered, usually by some sort of binary tree. Elements in a `set`
    are immutable and cannot be modified, but they can be inserted and removed. Elements
    in a `set` are *unique*, duplicates are not allowed. A `set` iterates in order
    according to its sorting operators.

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    are not sorted in any specific order, but are organized according to their hash
    values for fast access.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is mapped to a specific *value* (or *payload*). The types of the key and value
    may be different. Keys are unique but values are not. A map iterates in order
    of its keys, according to its sorting operators.

    value element, at the expense of logarithmic time insertion and extraction. The

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `quick_delete()` function uses a simple trick to delete elements from a
    vector quickly and efficiently. The element at the back of the vector is moved
    (*not copied*) into the position of the element to be deleted. The deleted element
    is discarded in the process. Then, the `pop_back()` function shortens the vector
    by one element from the end.
  prefs: []

    need anything more. Then we use the `strchr()` library function to check if a
    word contains one of the end-of-sentence punctuation characters (`".!?"`). These
    are the three possible characters to end a sentence in the English language.

    and the current word is added using `emplace_back()`. Then we call `is_eos()`
    to see if this was the end of a sentence. If so, we add a new empty vector to
    `vv_sentences` to start the next sentence.

    in the middle of words. That may happen in some forms of poetry or in a badly

    `vector` will already be large, containing all the words of the file. It's not
    necessary to also hold the entire text file in memory. In the rare case that a
    file is too large, it would be necessary to find another strategy, or use a database.

    stated, it's a list of tasks associated with a priority, sorted in reverse numerical
    order.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may be tempted to use a `priority_queue` for this, because as the name implies,
    it's already sorted in priority (reverse numerical) order. The disadvantage of
    a `priority_queue` is that it has no iterators, so it's difficult to operate on
    it without pushing and popping items to and from the queue.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For this recipe, we'll use a `multimap` for the ordered list. The `multimap`
    *associative container* keeps items in order, and it can be accessed using *reverse
    iterators* for the proper sort order.
