    like a long way off. But it wasn't too tough, I hope.

    to build games using C++.

- en: The point of this chapter is to congratulate you on a fine achievement but also
    to point out that this page probably shouldn't be the end of your journey. If,
    like me, you get a bit of a buzz whenever you make a new game feature come to
    life, then you probably want to learn more.

- en: It might surprise you to hear that, even after all these hundreds of pages,
    we have only dipped our toes into C++. Even the topics we did cover could be covered
    in more depth and there are numerous – some quite significant – topics that we
    haven't even mentioned. With this in mind, let's take a look at what might be
    next.

    is with a formal education. This, of course, is expensive and time-consuming,
    and I can't really help any further.

    on a game you will eventually release, then what follows is a discussion of what
    you might like to do next.

    our code. In my opinion, the absolute best source of information on how to structure
    your C++ game code is [http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/).
    Some of the discussion is around concepts that aren't covered in this book, but
    much of it will be completely accessible. If you understand classes, encapsulation,
    pure virtual functions, and singletons, dive into this website.
