- en: For many of us developers, **Virtual Reality** (**VR**) represents a relatively
    untapped market for unique games that take advantage of an amazing new technology.
    VR has the ability to drop our players directly into our digital worlds and provide
    them with an experience they cannot get anywhere else. However, the skills that
    are needed to adopt this new technology and create these worlds are not yet widespread
    and easy to come by. Our goal is to change this and help spread the word about
    the power of VR.

    Unreal Engine 4 has expanded its support for VR and continues to optimize its
    software to allow more developers to do amazing things. On the hardware side of
    things, both the number of manufacturers and the capabilities of the VR headsets
    on the market continue to increase. Many developers are making apps for the Oculus
    Rift and HTC Vive, though there are several other options to choose from, including
    PlayStation VR, Samsung Gear VR, and Windows Mixed Reality Headsets.

    VR. Over the course of the book, we will look at how to design for VR. We will
    program flexible interaction systems for this unique environment, create user
    interface elements, and discuss the specific game art needs of the medium. Finally,
    we will wrap up with a game prototype and prepare it for distribution.
