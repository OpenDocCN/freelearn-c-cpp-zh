			<h1 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Getting Familiar with Variables and Control Flow</h1>
			<p>Programming is all about manipulating data. In games, this data can be the position of the player, the amount of health they have, or what items they possess. These pieces of data are called <strong class="bold">variables</strong>, and in this chapter, we will learn how these variables work and how we can manipulate them.</p>
			<p>In the second part of this chapter, we’ll learn how to use these variables to make decisions during the game. For example, if the health of the player goes to zero, we end the game. This concept is called <strong class="bold">control flow</strong> because we control the flow throughout the code.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What are variables?</li>
				<li>Data types – Integers, floats, and strings</li>
				<li>What are constants?</li>
				<li>Getting started with control flow</li>
				<li>Commenting in code</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>We have prepared everything we need for <a href="B19358_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>. Check out the <code>chapter02</code> folder in the repository of code examples if you get stuck anywhere. You can find the repository here: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-GDScript-by-Developing-a-Game-with-Godot-4/tree/main/chapter02">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-GDScript-by-Developing-a-Game-with-Godot-4/tree/main/chapter02</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>What are variables?</h1>
			<p>Secretly, under the hood, games are all about data. The position of the player character, the names of your teammates in an online match, the volume amount in the setting window, or the maximum distance<a id="_idIndexMarker040"/> a fireball can travel – these are all pieces of data that the game works with to create an experience users like to play.</p>
			<p>For example, a player character’s position can change during play by pressing the arrow keys on a keyboard. The computer will take this input, calculate the new position, and show the player where their character is within the virtual world. The computer will do this in some capacity for every piece of data within the game. We will learn a lot more about how the computer does all of these calculations throughout the book, but first, we’ll have to learn about these little pieces of data, where they get stored on the computer, and how they are used while the game is running.</p>
			<p>Within the code of a game, each of these pieces of data gets represented by a variable. Let’s take a closer look at variables in the following section.<a id="_idTextAnchor048"/></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Variables – Drawers in a filing cabinet full of data</h2>
			<p>An excellent way to conceptualize variables is to see them as drawers in a filing cabinet. Each drawer is one variable and <a id="_idIndexMarker041"/>contains the data for that variable. If we want to change some of that data, we pull open the right drawer, change the value, and put the result back into the drawer. Of course, we need to know which drawer contains the data for the player’s position and which contains the number of lives the player has left. Mixing those up would lead to very confusing situations. Smart archivists solved this problem by putting name tags on each drawer so that they could see what data each contains at just a glance.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.1 – Conceptualizing variables as the drawers of a cabinet" src="img/B19358_02_1.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.1 – Conceptualizing variables as the drawers of a cabinet</p>
			<p>The same principle applies to <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>variables. When creating a variable, we start by giving it a name. The creation process reserves a <em class="italic">drawer</em>, a little bit of space in the computer’s memory, which we can call upon using the name we gave it. We can then use this name to retrieve the value of that variable from memory and store new values in the same drawer.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Naming variables</h2>
			<p>We have already talked<a id="_idIndexMarker043"/> about the importance of a variable’s name to reserve space and retrieve the data of a variable. They should be named in such a way that we can use them easily. However, there are some extra guidelines that variable names need to adhere to for them to be valid.</p>
			<h3>Using the correct characters</h3>
			<p>Variable names in GDScript cannot contain spaces. They can only consist of alphanumerical or underscore characters. Other characters will result in errors. So, the safe characters to use are <code>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890_</code>.</p>
			<p>Note that the name cannot begin <a id="_idIndexMarker044"/>with a number. You also cannot choose any of the built-in keywords of the programming language as a variable’s name, since this would be tremendously confusing for both you and the interpreter.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important notes</p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Keywords</strong>: Some words have<a id="_idIndexMarker045"/> special meanings within GDScript. They execute specific commands – for example, creating a variable. We call these words <strong class="bold">keywords</strong>. We’ll see a lot more of them throughout the book. Variable names cannot be existing keywords in GDScript.</p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Interpreter</strong>: The part of the engine that runs the<a id="_idIndexMarker046"/> code is called the <strong class="bold">interpreter</strong>. It goes down the GDScript code, line by line, and interprets it as machine-readable code. We’ll talk more about this in <a href="B19358_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor164"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>.</p>
			<p>The convention of naming variables in GDScript is not to use capital letters and use underscores to separate words; this way of naming variables is called <strong class="bold">snake case</strong>, or <strong class="bold">snake_case</strong>. I know, I know – I just told <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>you that capital letters are valid characters to use in variable names. But the GDScript convention is to (almost) never use these because they get used in different cases, such as the names of constants and classes. I’ll explain different naming and coding conventions further in <a href="B19358_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor365"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>. For now, it’s good to know that a coding convention is a guideline for how to style your code. It doesn’t say anything about the code’s logic, just how it is written.</p>
			<h3>Using descriptive names</h3>
			<p>Smart programmers give each variable a <a id="_idIndexMarker048"/>descriptive name so that we can see at a glance what data it contains. Use a variable name such as <code>number_of_lives</code> over something such as <code>nol</code>, <code>l</code>, or <code>lives</code>. Although when creating the variable you will know what data it contains, you will forget when you come back to the same code a month or even just a week later. Don’t worry about the length of a variable’s name. Knowing what kind of data it contains and how it is used matters more.</p>
			<p>In short, good variable names <a id="_idIndexMarker049"/>should look like this:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
var player_position
var car_acceleration
var distance_to_goal</pre>			<p>They should not look like this:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
var a
var thing
var PLaYerpOsition
var distancetogoal</pre>			<p>Now that we know how to name variables, let’s see how we can create and assign variables in GDScript in the next <a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Variables in GDScript</h2>
			<p>Let’s take a closer look at <a id="_idIndexMarker050"/>a variable in a script. Creating and assigning a variable in GDScript looks like this:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
var number_of_lives = 3</pre>			<p>In this example, there are four crucial steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>First, we specify that we are creating a new variable by using the <code>var</code> keyword.</li>
				<li>Second, we specify the name we want this variable to have – in our case, <code>number_of_lives</code>. Because of its name, we know that the data contained within the variable should be the number of lives.</li>
				<li>Third, we use an equals sign to indicate that we want to assign a value to our freshly created variable.</li>
				<li>Lastly, after the equals sign, we specify what data to put into the variable – in this example, the number <code>3</code>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It’s good to note that the assignments work from right to left. This means that the value on the right (<code>3</code> in this case) will be <a id="_idIndexMarker051"/>assigned to the variable on the left (<code>number_of_lives</code>).</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Note that assigning a variable is not the same as a mathematical equation. A mathematical equation, <code>x = 3</code> for example, signifies that both sides are equal. While a variable assignment, <code>number_of_lives = 3</code> for example, really stores the value on the right side in the variable on the left.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we’ll see <a id="_idIndexMarker052"/>how we can print<a id="_idTextAnchor053"/> variables.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Printing out variables</h2>
			<p>Until now, my explanation<a id="_idIndexMarker053"/> of variables has been abstract. So, let’s take some time to create a first script that uses variables!</p>
			<p>Open the <code>main.gd</code> script we created in <a href="B19358_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, and add a line that creates a variable for the number of lives after the line we used to print out <em class="italic">Hello, World</em>, at <em class="italic">line 7</em>, like so:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
   var number_of_lives = 3</pre>			<p>Again, ensure to include the tab at the start of the line. Usually, the editor will add it automatically.</p>
			<p>If we run this program, you won’t see much of a difference from when we ran it in <a href="B19358_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>. That is because creating variables doesn’t change anything in the execution of the game until we do something with them.</p>
			<p>I hear you think, “But can’t we use the <code>print()</code> command from earlier to print out the variable’s value?” We can, so let’s do that:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
   print(number_of_lives)</pre>			<p>The complete code looks like this now:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.2 – Printing out the number_of_lives variable can be done easily with the print function" src="img/B19358_02_2.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.2 – Printing out the number_of_lives variable can be done easily with the print function</p>
			<p>When we run the program, we see the following:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.3 – The result after printing out the number_of_lives variable" src="img/B19358_02_3.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.3 – The result after printing out the number_of_lives variable</p>
			<p>This result is already great, but <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>we can do more! We can pass multiple pieces of data to the same <code>print()</code> command, and it will print all of them on the same line in the order we provided them; try this line out in our script:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
print("The number of lives is: ", number_of_lives)</pre>			<p>Ensure that you put a comma between each piece of data when providing them to the <code>print()</code> command. We call a piece of data that we provide to a function an <strong class="bold">argument</strong>.</p>
			<p>The <code>printt()</code> command will print all values, just like the regular <code>print()</code> command, but will put a tab between each value. This command is one of my go-to debug techniques, but there’ll be more on that in <a href="B19358_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor100"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
printt("The player has", number_of_lives, "out of", 10, "lives left")</pre>			<p>As an experiment, try printing something with the <code>prints()</code> command. You can use it in the same way as the normal <code>print()</code> and <code>printt()</code> commands. However, in what way do they differ?</p>
			<p>If you did the experiment, you’ll see that <code>prints()</code> functions the same as <code>printt()</code>, but it now puts a space between each passed argument.</p>
			<p>Now that we know how to <a id="_idIndexMarker055"/>print out variables to observe their values, let’s have a look at how to change the values these var<a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>iables hold.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Changing a variable’s value</h2>
			<p>Unlike data in filing cabinets, data<a id="_idIndexMarker056"/> in a video game tends to be updated often, very often, and sometimes hundreds of times per second. Luckily, the syntax to update a variable is even simpler than creating one:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
var number_of_lives = 3
number_of_lives = 4 + 1</pre>			<p>The preceding code creates the <code>number_of_lives</code> variable and assigns it the value <code>3</code>, just like before. The step-by-step breakdown of what happens next is as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>First, we specify what variable we are using so that the computer knows what drawer of its filing cabinet to open up.</li>
				<li>Next, we use the assignment operator, the equals sign, which signals that we want to change that variable’s value to a new one.</li>
				<li>Lastly, we specify the new value – in this case, the result of <code>4 + 1</code>. The computer will do the math for us, conclude the result is <code>5</code>, and assign that value to the variable.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To summarize these two lines of code, we created a variable called <code>number_of_lives</code>, assigned it the value <code>3</code>, and, in the following line, assigned this same variable the value <code>5</code>.</p>
			<p>To take this a step further, you can also use other variables or even the same variable in an assignment like this:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
var number_of_lives = 3
var fireball_damage = 2
number_of_lives = number_of_lives - fireball_damage</pre>			<p>At the end of this code, <code>number_of_lives</code> will contain the value <code>1</code>. What happens after the equals sign on line three is as follows:</p>
			<p>The computer sees two variable names, looks them up, and substitutes them with their values. It will replace <code>number_of_lives - fire_ball_damage</code> with <code>3 - </code><code>2</code>.</p>
			<p>As in the preceding example, the computer does the math, concludes the result is <code>1</code>, and assigns this value<a id="_idIndexMarker057"/> to the <code>number_of_lives</code> variable.</p>
			<p>Extend our script with the preceding example and print out <code>number_of_lives</code> again to see the result:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.4 – Calculating the new number of lives that the player possesses when hit by a fireball" src="img/B19358_02_4.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.4 – Calculating the new number of lives that the player possesses when hit by a fireball</p>
			<p>Okay, we can change the value of a variable now. In the next section, we’ll look at what mathematical operations are ava<a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>ilable to us.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Mathematical operators</h2>
			<p>In the previous examples, we saw<a id="_idIndexMarker058"/> some mathematical operators, adding and subtracting numbers using the <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> operators. We call symbols such as <code>+</code> and <code>–</code> operators because they take data, such as numbers, and operate on them. GDScript provides us with all the expected mathematical operators, which work much the same and in the same order as in regular mathematics.</p>

			<p>Mathematical operators are the backbone of all data manipulation in programming. There is a way to write these mathematical <a id="_idIndexMarker060"/>equations more compactly. Let’s look at one of those methods next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Other assignment operators</h2>
			<p>We have assigned new valuesv<a id="_idIndexMarker061"/> to variables using the assignment operator (<code>=</code>), but there are other variations on this operator. Often, you want to add a number to a variable and store the result back in the same variable – for example, tracking the number of lives after a player heals from damage:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
number_of_lives = number_of_lives + 2</pre>			<p>This is such a frequently returning use case that there are special operators for this – <code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code>, <code>*=</code>, <code>/=</code>, <code>%=</code>, and <code>**=</code>. If we rewrite the previous example with one of these operators, we get this:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
number_of_lives += 2</pre>			<p>This code says, take the value of <code>number_of_lives</code>, add the number <code>2</code> to that, and assign the result back to <code>number_of_lives</code>.</p>
			<p>The other assignment operators follow the same structure, just with other operations such as subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and power. Note that you cannot use these special assignment operators while creating the variable because it will not exist yet.</p>
			<p>As an experiment, try using one of these special assignments while creating a variable and see what error pops up.</p>
			<p>If we use the <code>-=</code> operator to subtract the fireball damage from the number of lives, we get this code:</p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.6 – Using the -= assignment operator to subtract the fireball damage from a player’s health</p>
			<p>We learned all about variables<a id="_idIndexMarker062"/> and how to change them during the execution of our game. In the next section, we’ll take a look at the different types of data we can store in these variable<a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>s.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>Data types – Integers, floats, and strings</h1>
			<p>Until now, we’ve only worked with numbers, but variables can hold many different data types. In this section, we’ll go over three of the most used data types. Throughout the book, we’ll see even more types whenever they are applicable<a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Integers</h2>
			<p><code>1</code>, <code>-422</code> or <code>10983457</code>. They do not contain a decimal point. They work very well for counting the number of lives or bullets. An integer in the GDScript can be any value between <code>-9223372036854775808</code> and <code>9223372036854775807</code>. This is a limit that is imposed by the way numbers are represented <a id="_idIndexMarker064"/>within the computer using bits; it’s not an arbitrary number imposed by Godot itself. The number will wrap around and switch from very, very high to very, very low if you cross this barrier in any direction, which is not recommended. Luckily, this range gives us more numbers than the number of stars in our galaxy by a few magnitudes, so we should be safe:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
var big_number = 9223372036854775807
big_number = big_number + 1</pre>			<p>After running this code, our<a id="_idIndexMarker065"/> variable, <code>big_number</code>, will contain the smallest number possible in a GDScript <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>int<a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>eger!</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Floats</h2>
			<p><code>3.41</code>, <code>-1978.8791</code>, or <code>1.0</code>. They are very<a id="_idIndexMarker068"/> well-suited to handle <a id="_idIndexMarker069"/>more specific numbers, speeds, positions, or estimations of <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/>real numbers, such as pi for example. A float in GDScript has a precision of up to <code>14</code> decimal digits.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Integers can be stored in a float, as long as they are small enough, without problems. However, when we store a float in an integer, everything <a id="_idIndexMarker071"/>after the decimal point will be thrown away! This is called <strong class="bold">implicit type conversion</strong>, because we implicitly convert the float to an integer.</p>
			<p>A curious thing to know is that computers are very bad at dealing with floating-poin<a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>t numbers. Because of the way computers work, they cannot accurately represent every possible number and, thus, will have to round them off at some point. This results in minute deviations from what you would expect the result of a calculation to be. We will not have to worry about this too much, but it comes up sometimes and is good to remember.</p>
			<p>For example, the next line of code sums <code>0.1</code> and <code>0.1</code>. You would expect the result to be <code>0.2</code>, but what do you actually observe? Don’t worry about the weird string at the beginning; this makes sure it prints the result with <code>20</code> digits behind the decimal point. What matters is the summation between the parenthesis:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
print("%.20f" % <code>0.20000000000000001000</code>.</p>
			<p>And although the difference between <code>0.2</code> and <code>0.20000000000000001</code> is very, very small, they are two different numbers for the computer.</p>
			<p>Of course, programming languages can also handle data that is not a number. Let’s have a loo<a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>k at text.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Strings</h2>
			<p>Ah, our first non-numerical data type. <code>"</code>) or single (<code>'</code>) quotes is a <a id="_idIndexMarker073"/>string. You can store a string in a variable like so:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
var character_name = "Erik"</pre>			<p>Strings in GDScript can contain any <strong class="bold">Unicode character</strong>, which is basically any character from any global language<a id="_idIndexMarker074"/> all over the world and more! Strings can have any length, as long as you don’t run out of memory on your computer.</p>
			<p>As previously mentioned, you can use double or single quotes to create a string, as they’ll both work; just make sure you begin and end the string with the same kind of quote. The convention in GDScript is to use double quotes:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
"One string, using double quotes, as is convention in GDScript"
'Another string, using single quotes'</pre>			<p>We had a look at three basic data types within programming languages. In the next section, we’ll talk about a special kind of variable that never changes its value – <a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>the constant.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>What are constants?</h1>
			<p>We’ve talked extensively about variables, but <a id="_idIndexMarker075"/>there is a second type of container to put data in – <strong class="bold">constants</strong>. A constant is a special kind of variable. It also stores any kind of data type, just like variables, but you are not able to change it during the execution of a program; it stays constant. Otherwise, it is exactly the same as a variable and has the same restrictions on its name.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Constants in GDScript</h2>
			<p>Let’s take a closer look at a constant in a <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>script. To define a constant, you need to use the <code>const</code> keyword, like<a id="_idIndexMarker077"/> so:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
const MAX_NUMBER_OF_BULLETS = 100</pre>			<p>Note that the name of this constant is <code>MAX_NUMBER_OF_BULLETS</code>. Unlike normal variables, using all capitals is the convention for constants; this is known as s<strong class="bold">creaming snake case</strong>, or <strong class="bold">SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE</strong>. This way, we know that we will not be able to change them in our<a id="_idIndexMarker078"/> code.</p>
			<p>Using a constant is exactly the same as using a variable. Try this out in your code:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
const FIREBALL_DAMAGE = 2
number_of_lives = number_of_lives - FIREBALL_DAMAGE
print("The number of lives is: ", number_of_lives)</pre>			<p>This snippet of code should print out the following:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
<code>The number of lives is 3.</code></pre>			<p>As an experiment, try to assign a new value to a constant and see what error pops up:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
const FIREBALL_DAMAGE = 2
FIREBALL_DAMAGE = 10</pre>			<p>The interpreter will throw the following error:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Cannot assign a new value to a constant</pre>			<p>You can see the result in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.7</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.7 – Changing a constant will result in an error" src="img/B19358_02_7.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.7 – Changing a constant will result in an error</p>
			<p>Next to defining values that<a id="_idIndexMarker079"/> cannot change, constants also help us by associating a name to the value so that we don’t have to use raw values. The name of a constant helps us give context to what the value of the constant represents. Let’s look why this important with ma<a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>gic numbers next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>Magic numbers</h2>
			<p>Lastly, constants are used to remove <strong class="bold">magic numbers</strong>. In programming, we call a number a magic number <a id="_idIndexMarker080"/>when it is just a number within code without<a id="_idIndexMarker081"/> any context, such as the following:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
number_of_lives += 5</pre>			<p>From this snippet of code, you wouldn’t be able to deduce why I added <code>5</code> to the number of lives, but with a properly named constant, we can clarify this, like so:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
const LIVES_RESTORED_BY_HEALTH_POTION = 5
number_of_lives += LIVES_RESTORED_BY_HEALTH_POTION</pre>			<p>Magic numbers are generally bad and make your code harder to read and follow.</p>
			<p>Constants are used a lot to keep code clean; they show us what values should never change. They are also useful during debugging because you know they will never change, and you don’t have to trace what their value is throughout the execution of the game.</p>
			<p>So far, we have covered all the basic concepts related to variables and constants. Now, let’s have a look at how we can <a id="_idIndexMarker082"/>create new scenes before divin<a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>g into control flows.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>Creating new scenes</h1>
			<p>We have been experimenting with the same scene and script file for now. Working like this was okay for now, but we <a id="_idIndexMarker083"/>need a way to create different scripts for different topics and solutions to separate all lessons. This way, we don’t have to throw away all our previous experiments and can have a clean scene every time.</p>
			<p>Luckily, we can easily make a new scene and use a different script. We can even name the scene to identify what happens within.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Remember that a scene is a separate file that can be executed. It contains a collection of nodes. For now, we only use one root node. Later, from <a href="B19358_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor411"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, we will work with more intricate scenes that contain more nodes.</p>
			<p>To create a new scene, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Right-click anywhere in the <strong class="bold">FileSystem</strong> window and choose <strong class="bold">New Scene…</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.8 – We can select the option to create a new scene by right-clicking in the file manager" src="img/B19358_02_8.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.8 – We can select the option to create a new scene by right-clicking in the file manager</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">The new scene will load into the Editor.</li>
				<li>Choose a 2D scene, just like we did in <a href="B19358_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>.</li>
				<li>Name the root node appropriately, such as <code>ControlFlowTest</code>.</li>
				<li>Save the scene.</li>
				<li>Attach a script to the root node, like in <a href="B19358_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>. You can leave the name as the default generated from the node’s name.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You should repeat these steps for every exercise you do to ensure an orderly project. Want extra plus points? Create folders to organize your code and scenes. They’ll be more on organizing projects in <a href="B19358_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor365"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>.</p>
			<p>It is possible to move<a id="_idIndexMarker084"/> scripts and scenes around to different directories; just make sure you do so within the <strong class="bold">FileSystem</strong> dock of Godot Engine itself. This way, the engine tracks where the files move to and ensures everything keeps working.</p>
			<p>If you want to run the currently opened scene, click the <strong class="bold">Run Current Scene</strong> button (see <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.9</em>). The normal <strong class="bold">Run</strong> button runs the main scene of the project, while the <strong class="bold">Run Current Scene</strong> button runs the currently opened scene.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.9 – The Run Current Scene button can be found at the top-right" src="img/B19358_02_9.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.9 – The Run Current Scene button can be found at the top-right</p>
			<p>Alright, we are able to a new scene for each chapter or experiment. Let’s make a new scene for the next section and learn about how programs can make decisions <a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>using control flows.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>Getting started with control flow</h1>
			<p>By themselves, computers are pretty dumb. They don’t know what to do or how to reason independently. In this part of the chapter, we’ll learn how to instruct a computer to make decisions based on the data it receives.</p>
			<p>Computers do exactly what <a id="_idIndexMarker085"/>we tell them to. As you’ll come to understand while learning to code, this is a blessing and a curse at the same time. It means that we must be very precise in formulating what we desire from them. Luckily, there are multiple structures to provid<a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>e these instructions.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>The if statement</h2>
			<p>The easiest way to make<a id="_idIndexMarker086"/> decisions, on a computer or otherwise, is by using an <code>if</code> statement. An <code>if</code> statement looks like this: <em class="italic">If the player’s health is below zero, end the game</em>. We could <a id="_idIndexMarker087"/>generalize this as <em class="italic">if a certain condition is true, perform an action</em>. The code to make this decision could look like this:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
if number_of_lives &lt; 0:
   print("You died!")</pre>			<p>This code can be read as a sentence: <em class="italic">if the number of lives is below 0, print out You died!</em>. The separate parts of the code are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <code>if</code> keyword indicates that we start an <code>if</code> statement.</li>
				<li>A condition – in this case, <code>numbers_of_lives &lt; </code><code>0</code>.</li>
				<li>The condition is followed by a colon (<code>:</code>), indicating the beginning of the code block that will get executed <em class="italic">if</em> the condition is true. In the English language, a comma often performs the split between the two.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The general structure of an <code>if</code> statement goes like this:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
if &lt;condition&gt;:
   &lt;code block&gt;</pre>			<p>Note that the code block is indented once to the right using one tab.</p>
			<p>The simplest conditions just compare two values against each other. In GDScript, the operators to compare values are listed in <em class="italic">Table 2.2</em>:</p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 2.2 – Operators to compare values in GDScript</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">The equal operator uses two equal signs (<code>==</code>). It will be interpreted as an assignment operator if you use a single equal sign (<code>=</code>).</p>
			<p>As an experiment, try printing <a id="_idIndexMarker088"/>the result of the following: <code>print(10 == 5)</code> or <code>print(3 &gt;= </code><code>1)</code>.</p>
			<p>If you did the previous experiment, you<a id="_idIndexMarker089"/> would see that the <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> values were printed in the console. These indicate whether the condition was evaluated as <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> by the computer. This is a new data type we call a <strong class="bold">Boolean</strong>. You can put a Boolean in a variable, just like any other data type:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
var player_died = number_of_lives &lt; 0
var a_true_boolean = true</pre>			<p>A variable containing a Boolean value can then be used in an <code>if</code>-statement as a substitute for the whole condition:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
if player_died:
   print("You died!")</pre>			<p>Unlike other data types, which could have millions or billions of different possible values, Booleans only have<a id="_idIndexMarker090"/> two possible values, <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. You can also use<a id="_idIndexMarker091"/> these values directly, without storing them.</p>
			<p>In the following code, we see a Boolean value used directly in an <code>if</code> statement and as a value in a variable:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
if <strong class="bold">true</strong>:
   print("This code will always be executed")
var always_false = <strong class="bold">false</strong>
if always_false:
   print("This code will never be executed")</pre>			<p>We learned that <code>if</code> statements evaluate conditions and only execute their code block when a condition turns out to be <code>true</code>. We also learned about the Boolean data type, which can have a <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> value. But what if we want to execute another code block if the condition is <code>false</code>? Let’s find out in the next sect<a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>ion.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>The if-else statement</h2>
			<p>We use <code>if</code> statements in everyday <a id="_idIndexMarker092"/>conversations all the time. An extension to<a id="_idIndexMarker093"/> this structure, which we also use very frequently, is the <code>if-else</code> statement. Let’s say a player needs to acquire points within a game, and at the end, they win if they have at least <code>50</code> points. <em class="italic">If the player’s</em> score <em class="italic">is</em> higher than or equal to <code>50</code>, they win the game; otherwise, they lose. We can generalize this again as <em class="italic">if a certain condition is true, perform one action; if this condition is false, perform </em><em class="italic">another action</em>.</p>
			<p>In GDScript, we express the <code>if-else</code> statement like so:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
if score &gt;= 50:
   print("You Win!")
<strong class="bold">else</strong>:
   print("You Lose!")</pre>			<p>The general structure of an <code>if-else</code> statement goes like this:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
if &lt;condition&gt;:
   &lt;code block&gt;
else:
   &lt;code block&gt;</pre>			<p>The <code>if</code> statement gets extended with an <code>else</code> statement that is at the same level as the <code>if</code>. Note the colon (<code>:</code>) after the <code>else</code> keyword and further indentation, signaling the beginning of a new code block.</p>
			<p>Note that you can write <a id="_idIndexMarker094"/>two <code>if</code> statements that have the exact same behavior as an <code>if-else</code> statement. The condition of the second <code>if</code> statement just has to <a id="_idIndexMarker095"/>cover everything the first one didn’t:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
if number_of_lives &lt; 0:
   print("You died!")
if number_of_lives &gt;= 0:
   print("You live!")</pre>			<p>You usually will not do this, as a standard <code>if-else</code> structure is more straightforward in the code.</p>
			<p>As an experiment, create a new scene and rewrite the previous code snippet with an <code>if-else</code> sta<a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>tement.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>The elif statement</h2>
			<p>Sometimes, you <a id="_idIndexMarker096"/>want more than two<a id="_idIndexMarker097"/> different outcomes. Luckily, we can extend an <code>if</code>-statement with as many <code>elif</code>s as we like. <code>elif</code> is an abbreviation of <em class="italic">else if</em> and functions much the same as a normal <code>if</code> statement, except that it always comes after an <code>if</code> statement:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
if number_of_lives &lt; 0:
   print("You died!")
<strong class="bold">elif</strong> number_of_lives &lt;= 1:
   print("You could die with only one blow!")
elif number_of_lives &lt;= 3:
   print("You don't have a lot of lives left.")
else:
   print("You LIVE!")</pre>			<p>First, the computer will evaluate the first <code>if</code> statement. If it is <code>true</code>, it will run its code and stop there. If it returns <code>false</code>, it will go to the next <code>elif</code> statement. If that one is <code>true</code>, it will run its code and stop there. If it is <code>false</code>, it will go to the next <code>elif</code> and so on. If none of these <a id="_idIndexMarker098"/>return <code>true</code>, the computer will default to the code within the <code>else</code> statement, if there is one.</p>
			<p>Note that if you tested a<a id="_idIndexMarker099"/> condition in a previous <code>elif</code>, you can be sure it is <code>false</code> in consecutive <code>elif</code> conditions. This is because if it would have been <code>true</code>, the computer would have stopped there and executed that <code>elif</code>’s code block. Therefore, you don’t have to recheck previous conditions again.</p>
			<p>The general structure of an <code>if</code>-<code>elif</code>-<code>else</code> statement goes like this:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
if &lt;condition&gt;:
   &lt;code block&gt;
elif &lt;condition&gt;:
   &lt;code block&gt;
&lt;more elif statements&gt;
else:
   &lt;code block&gt;</pre>			<p>That concludes our exploration of the different <code>if</code> statements. Now, let’s have a look at how we can add commentary to our code to clarify what we are trying <a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>to achieve.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>Commenting in code</h2>
			<p>Like writing a book, code can get<a id="_idIndexMarker100"/> complex as it grows in length. On top of that, although you may understand what a piece of code does while writing it, you can forget what it actually does when returning to it after weeks or months. We have been naming our variables correctly, which is one of the best ways of combating this issue, but there is<a id="_idIndexMarker101"/> another powerful method – <strong class="bold">comments</strong>.</p>
			<p>Comments are text in your code that is not executed while running the game. So, they are purely there for somebody reading the code to understand what it does.</p>
			<p>Comments in GDScript start with the hash sign (<code>#</code>). Everything after a hash symbol will be ignored by the GDScript interpreter, such as the following:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
# This is a comment and will be ignored by Godot
var number_of_lives = 2 # This is also a comment</pre>			<p>From now on, I’ll start using comments in code examples to give extra context, and I encourage you to do the same! I’ll also use comments to summarize and substitute actual code, leaving the exact implementation as an exercise for you.</p>
			<p>Another interesting use for comments is to comment out certain lines of code when you don’t need them momentarily but don’t want to remove them completely from the code. That could look like this:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
# var number_of_lives = 2
var number_of_lives = 5 # Let's try 5 lives instead of 2</pre>			<p>The shortcuts to comment out pieces of code in the Godot Editor is <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">K</em> for Windows and Linux and <em class="italic">Cmd</em> + <em class="italic">K</em> for MacOS. Try selecting some code and using these shortcuts to comment out lines here and there.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Although comments are pretty great, it’s always better to name your variables properly, so don’t slack<a id="_idTextAnchor086"/> off on that.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>Indentation</h2>
			<p>Consecutive lines of code with the <a id="_idIndexMarker102"/>same amount of whitespace on their left belong to the same code block. We call this whitespace <strong class="bold">indentation</strong> because we indent the<a id="_idIndexMarker103"/> code toward the right.</p>
			<p>As an experiment, try not indenting the code block after an <code>if</code> statement and see what error pops up.</p>
			<p>We can even nest code blocks. We already do this with functions and <code>if</code> statements, but it’s also possible to nest an <code>if</code> statement within another <code>if</code> statement, like so:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
var number_of_lives = 0
var damage_type = "fire"
if number_of_lives &lt;= 0:
   print("You died!")
   if damage_type == "fire":
      print("By going up in flames")
   elif damage_type == "water":
      print("By drowning")</pre>			<p>You can see indentation as a pyramid; each layer builds upon the previous one, and each time, we go one layer deeper. So far, we have seen that functions and <code>if</code>-statements require a code block, but shortly, we’ll see more structures that will need one.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.10 – Indentation separates different code blocks" src="img/B19358_02_10.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.10 – Indentation separates different code blocks</p>
			<p>Indentation in GDScript is <a id="_idIndexMarker104"/>critical.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Indentation is also important in Python, a language that has a lot of similarities with GDScript. Most other programming languages don’t really care about indentation, but they use other methods to delimit code blocks, such as the renowned curly brackets (<code>{}</code>).</p>
			<p>For each code block, the type of whitespace <em class="italic">and</em> how much should be the same. We have been using one tab per indentation layer as we go deeper. The other kind of whitespace you could use are regular space characters, such as the ones between the words of a sentence. There is a whole debate on whether tabs or spaces are the best. I like tabs, but if you want to use spaces, use at least four of them to signal a new code block.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">The code in this book does not use tabs for layout reasons; that is why I advise against copy-pasting code into your game. You can use the complete code available in the GitHub repo of the book here: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-GDScript-by-Developing-a-Game-with-Godot-4">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-GDScript-by-Developing-a-Game-with-Godot-4</a></p>
			<p>As an experiment, try to use tabs in one line and spaces in another line of code of the same code block to see what error pops up.</p>
			<p>If you look closely at your script in the Script editor, you’ll see that it visualizes indentation using the tab symbol, as demonstrated in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.11</em>.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.11 – The Script editor shows tabs within the code" src="img/B19358_02_11.jpg"/>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.11 – The Script editor shows tabs within the code</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we saw that <a id="_idIndexMarker105"/>GDScript expects a code block to be present after an <code>if</code> statement. In <a href="B19358_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor100"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, we’ll learn about more structures that requi<a id="_idTextAnchor088"/><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>re code blocks.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>Boolean logic</h1>
			<p>Computers don’t <a id="_idIndexMarker106"/>understand ambiguity. Conversely, human language is very ambiguous. We can do this because we regard the full context of a conversation. For example, the sentence “<em class="italic">Do you like coffee or tea?</em>” could be interpreted in two different ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It could enquire whether you like one over the other</li>
				<li>It could enquire whether you like either of them</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Depending on the context, both <em class="italic">Tea</em> or <em class="italic">Coffee</em> and <em class="italic">Yes</em> or <em class="italic">No</em> are possible answers to that question. Computers, however, only know about what you tell them at any given moment. So, a computer would be happier with the sentence “<em class="italic">If you needed to choose any of the two options, do you like coffee or tea?</em>” But then again, how do you express all this in code?</p>
			<p>To deal with this, an intelligent mathematician came up with <code>if</code> statements. Boolean logic has three major components:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>number_of_lives == 2</code> or <code>5 &lt; </code><code>1</code>.</li>
				<li><code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Parentheses</strong>: Like in regular math, parentheses change the order in which a computer evaluates statements.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These three elements combined are very powerful. A statement in Boolean logic looks like this:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
number_of_lives &lt; 2 <code>and</code> operator to combine two statements into a single big one. The statement will return <code>true</code> if, and only if, both the smaller statements it combines return <code>true</code> – that is, if <code>number_of_lives</code> is smaller than <code>2</code> <em class="italic">and</em> <code>is_hit</code> is <code>true</code>. In all other cases, this will return <code>false</code>.</p>
			<p>Another statement in Boolean logic could look like this:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
number_of_lives &lt; 2 <code>or</code> operator. The statement will return <code>true</code> if <code>number_of_lives</code> is smaller than <code>2</code> <em class="italic">or</em> the amount of damage is larger or equal to <code>6</code>. So, there is only one case in which the statement returns <code>false</code> – when the number of lives is <code>2</code> or higher <em class="italic">and</em> the damage is smaller than <code>6</code>.</p>
			<p>To visualize these relationships of the operators, have a look at the following tables, called truth tables. <em class="italic">Table 2.3</em> shows the results of the <code>or</code> operator for all the possible values of the two conditions it combines.</p>

			<p>The <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> operators can also be combined into one statement to make it as long and complex as we want:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
number_of_lives &lt; 2 and damage &gt;= 6 or is_hit</pre>			<p>In such a case, the <code>and</code> operator will always get evaluated first, followed by the <code>or</code> operator. This means that <code>number_of_lives &lt; 2 and damage</code> will get evaluated first, after which the result will be combined with <code>or is_hit</code>.</p>
			<p>To overrule this behavior, you can use parentheses. For example, if you want to evaluate <code>damage &gt;= 6 or is_hit</code> first, you can use parentheses, like so:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
number_of_lives &lt; 2 and (damage &gt;= 6 or is_hit)</pre>			<p>The last operator that interests <a id="_idIndexMarker109"/>us is the <code>not</code> operator. This one negates statements, transforming a <code>true</code> statement into a <code>false</code> one, and vice versa, such as the following:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
not damage &gt;= 6</pre>			<p>This statement returns <code>true</code> if the damage is smaller than <code>6</code> and <code>false</code> if it is larger or equal to <code>6</code>. Note that the <code>not</code> operator doesn’t combine two statements but works on only one.</p>
			<p>You can also use <code>not</code> in front of the parentheses to negate a whole group of statements, like so:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
number_of_lives &lt; 2 and not (damage &gt;= 6 or is_hit)</pre>			<p>To visualize the result of the <code>not</code> operator, see the following table:</p>

			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">In older programming languages, such as C++ and Java, the <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code> operators were portrayed by different symbols (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, and <code>!</code>, respectively). Luckily, in GDScript, we spell them out entirely. You can still use the symbols in GDScript if you like, but the spelled-out ones make statements easy to read and understand. Just read out a statement, and it should make sense in human words, although less ambiguous.</p>
			<p>With Boolean logic<a id="_idIndexMarker110"/> under our belt, let’s have a look at some more control flow structures.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor091"/>The match statement</h2>
			<p>In one of the previous<a id="_idIndexMarker111"/> examples, we used the <code>damage_type</code> variable, which<a id="_idIndexMarker112"/> can hold all the different kinds of damage in a game (fire, water, electricity, etc.). If we wanted to do something specific for each type, we could use a whole bunch of <code>if</code>-<code>elif</code>  statements, like so:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
if damage_type == "fire":
   # Do something with fire
elif damage_type == "water":
   # Do something with water
# And so on …
else:
   # No damage type matched</pre>			<p>However, there is a nicer and more powerful way of doing this! Enter the <code>match</code> statement would look like this:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">match</strong> damage_type:
   "fire":
      # Do something with fire
   "water":
      # Do something with water
# And so on ...
   _:
      # No damage type matched</pre>			<p>In this example, you can see that we check whether the <code>damage_type</code> variable matches any of the following values. If it does, we execute the block of code underneath it. If none match, we execute the <a id="_idIndexMarker113"/>code under the <code>"_"</code> case, which you can see as <code>else</code> in an <code>if-else</code> statement. This case with the underscore is called the wildcard <a id="_idIndexMarker114"/>or default case.</p>
			<p>The general structure of a <code>match</code> statement looks like this:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
match &lt;variable&gt;:
   &lt;pattern&gt;:
      &lt;code block&gt;
   &lt;pattern&gt;:
      &lt;code block&gt;
   _:
      &lt;code block&gt;</pre>			<p>Note that the underscore is not mandatory; you can leave it out if you want, as we do in the next example.</p>
			<p>The values we match against can also be another data type, such as numbers. We can even have multiple different values for the same case if we separate them using a comma:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
match a_variable:
   "fire", "water":
      # a_variable had the value "fire" or "water"
   1, 2:
      # a_variable had the value 1 or 2</pre>			<p>This example shows that the <code>fire</code> and <code>water</code> values will make the <code>match</code> statement execute the first code block, while the values <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> will make it execute the second one.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">These are not all the kinds of patterns that a <code>match</code> statement can work on. For a more exhaustive list, check out the official Godot documentation on the <code>match</code> statement at <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html#match">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html#match</a>.</p>
			<p>The <code>match</code> and <code>if-elif-else</code> statements <a id="_idIndexMarker115"/>can be pretty big; let’s have<a id="_idIndexMarker116"/> a look at a construction that is a bit more compact – the <code>ternary-if</code> stat<a id="_idTextAnchor092"/>ement.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor093"/>The ternary-if statement</h2>
			<p>The last control flow structure in this chapter is the <code>if-else</code> statement is a more readable way of writing the same <a id="_idIndexMarker117"/>behavior, but it’s <a id="_idIndexMarker118"/>good to know this kind of control flow exists.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, you may want to do something like this:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
var amount_of_damage
if damage_type == "fire":
   amount_of_damage = 5
else:
   amount_of_damage = 1</pre>			<p>We create a variable, <code>amount_of_damage</code>, and assign it the value <code>5</code> if the <code>damage_type</code> is <code>"fire"</code>, and <code>1</code> in all other cases. A <code>ternary-if</code> statement condenses this whole structure to one line:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
var amount_of_damage = 5 if damage_type == "fire" else 1</pre>			<p>This line will have the exact same effect as the preceding code snippet. It’s just a lot more compact. The confusing part of a <code>ternary-if</code> statement is that it starts with the value that gets returned if the condition is <code>true</code>. You should read this as “return <code>5</code> if the <code>damage_type</code> is equal to <code>"fire"</code>; else, return <code>1</code>.”</p>
			<p>The general structure of a <code>ternery-if</code> statement is as follows:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
&lt;value&gt; if &lt;condition&gt; else &lt;value&gt;</pre>			<p>There is a way to chain <code>ternary-if</code> statements to create something that functions like an <code>if</code>-<code>elif</code>-<code>else</code> structure. However, I would advise against overusing this and would always use a regular <code>if</code>-<code>elif</code>-<code>else</code> statement<a id="_idIndexMarker119"/> in such a <a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>scenario, as it is easier to read and c<a id="_idTextAnchor094"/>omprehend.</p>
