<p><span>This</span><span> chapter focuses on how to create C++ classes and structs that integrate well with the UE4 blueprints editor.</span></p>
<p>The classes we will be creating in this chapter are graduated versions of the regular C++ classes, and are called<span> </span><kbd>UCLASS</kbd>.</p>
<div class="packt_tip"><span>A </span><kbd>UCLASS</kbd><span> is just a C++ class with a whole lot of UE4 macro decoration on top. The macros generate additional C++ header code that enables integration with the UE4 editor itself.</span></div>
<p>Using <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> is a great practice to get into. The <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> macro, if configured correctly, can possibly make your <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> blueprintable, which can enable your custom C++ objects to be used within Unreal's visual-scripting language blueprints. This can be really useful if you have designers on your team, as they can access and tweak aspects of your project without having to dive into code.</p>
<p>We can have blueprint's visually editable properties (<kbd>UPROPERTY</kbd>) with handy UI widgets such as text fields, sliders, and model selection boxes. You can also have functions (such as <kbd>UFUNCTION</kbd>) that are callable from within a blueprints diagram. Both of these are shown in the following screenshots:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/48b7d5fd-8b17-41f9-b7fd-2d363741cd9e.jpg"/></p>
<p>On the left, two <kbd>UPROPERTY</kbd> decorated class members (a <kbd>UTexture</kbd> reference and an <kbd>FColor</kbd>) show up for editing in a C++ class's blueprint. On the right, a C++ <kbd>GetName</kbd> function marked as <kbd>BlueprintCallable UFUNCTION</kbd> shows up as callable from a blueprints diagram.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox"><span>Code generated by the </span><kbd>UCLASS</kbd><span> macro will be located in a </span><kbd>ClassName.generated.h</kbd><span> file, which will be the last </span><kbd>#include</kbd><span> required in your </span><kbd>UCLASS</kbd><span> header file, </span><kbd>ClassName.h</kbd><span>.</span></div>
<div class="packt_tip"><span>You will notice that the sample objects we create in this class, even when blueprintable, will not be placed in levels. That is because in order to be placed in levels, your C++ class must derive from the </span><kbd>Actor</kbd><span> base class, or a subclass below it.</span> <span>See </span><a href="eade601c-4b55-484a-ba49-0a989d81d7f8.xhtml"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 4</span></a><span>, </span><em>Actors and Components</em><span>, for further details.</span></div>
<p>UE4 code is, typically, very easy to write and manage once you know the patterns. The code we write to derive from another <kbd>UCLASS</kbd>, or to create a <kbd>UPROPERTY</kbd> or <kbd>UFUNCTION</kbd> instance, is very consistent. This chapter provides recipes for common UE4 coding tasks revolving around basic <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> derivation, property and reference declaration, construction, destruction, and general functionality.</p>

<p>When coding with C++, you can have your own code that compiles and runs as native C++ code, with appropriate calls to the <kbd>new</kbd> and <kbd>delete</kbd> operators to create and destroy your custom objects. Native C++ code is perfectly acceptable in your UE4 project as long as your <kbd>new</kbd> and <kbd>delete</kbd> calls are appropriately paired so that no memory leaks are present in your code.</p>
<p>You can, however, also declare custom C++ classes, which behave like UE4 classes, by declaring your custom C++ objects using the <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> macro. The <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> macro tells the class to make use of UE4's smart pointers and memory management routines for allocation and de-allocation according to their smart pointer rules, which can be loaded and read by the UE4 editor automatically, and can optionally be accessed from blueprints.</p>
<div class="packt_tip"><span>Note that when you use the </span><kbd>UCLASS</kbd><span> macro, your </span><kbd>UCLASS</kbd><span> object's creation and destruction must be completely managed by UE4: you must use the </span><kbd>ConstructObject</kbd><span> function to create an instance of your object (not the C++ native keyword </span><kbd>new</kbd><span>), and call the </span><kbd>UObject::ConditionalBeginDestroy()</kbd><span> function to destroy the object (not the C++ native keyword </span><kbd>delete</kbd><span>).</span></div>

<p>In this recipe, we will outline how to write a C++ class that uses the <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> macro to enable managed memory allocation and de-allocation, as well as to permit access from the UE4 editor and blueprints. To complete this recipe, you will need a UE4 project that you can add new code to.</p>

<p>To create your own <kbd>UObject</kbd> derivative class, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>From your running project, select <span class="packt_screen">File</span> | <span class="packt_screen">New<span class="packt_screen"> C++ Class</span></span> inside the UE4 editor.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Add C++ Class</span> dialog that appears, go to the upper-right-hand side of the window and tick the <span class="packt_screen">Show All Classes</span> checkbox:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/4dc61190-34b3-4777-a3b1-dbd680a1c64b.png"/></p>
<ol start="3">
<li class="mce-root"><span>Select</span> <kbd>Object</kbd> <span>(top of the hierarchy) as the parent class to inherit from, and then click on</span> <span class="packt_screen">Next</span><span>.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_tip">Note that although <kbd>Object</kbd> will be written in the dialog box, in your C++ code, the C++ class you will be deriving from is actually <kbd>UObject</kbd> with a leading uppercase <kbd>U</kbd>. This is the naming convention of UE4.<br/>
<br/>
<kbd>UCLASS</kbd> deriving from <kbd>UObject</kbd> (on a branch other than <kbd>Actor</kbd>) must be named with a leading <kbd>U</kbd>.<br/>
<br/>
<kbd>UCLASS</kbd> deriving from <kbd>Actor</kbd> must be named with a leading <kbd>A</kbd> (<a href="eade601c-4b55-484a-ba49-0a989d81d7f8.xhtml"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 4</span></a>, <em>Actors and Components</em>).<br/>
<br/>
C++ classes (that are not <kbd>UCLASS</kbd>) deriving from nothing do not have a naming convention, but can be named with a leading <kbd>F</kbd> (for example, <kbd>FAssetData</kbd>), if preferred.<br/>
<br/>
Direct derivatives of <kbd>UObject</kbd> will not be level-placeable, even if they contain visual representation elements such as <kbd>UStaticMeshes</kbd>. If you want to place your object inside a UE4 level, you must at least derive from the <kbd>Actor</kbd> class or beneath it in the inheritance hierarchy. See <a href="eade601c-4b55-484a-ba49-0a989d81d7f8.xhtml"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 4</span></a>, <em>Actors and Components,</em> for more information how to derive from the <kbd>Actor</kbd> class for a level-placeable object.</div>
<div class="packt_tip packt_infobox"><br/>
This chapter's example code will not be placeable in the level, but you can create and use blueprints based on the C++ classes that we write in this chapter in the UE4 editor.</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Name your new <kbd>Object</kbd> derivative something appropriate for the object type that you are creating. I'll call mine <kbd>UserProfile</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/17828513-6e03-4510-8764-731dddf869c3.png"/></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">This comes off as <kbd>UUserObject</kbd> in the naming of the class in the C++ file that UE4 generates to ensure that the UE4 conventions are followed (In C++, class names with a <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> are preceded with a leading <kbd>U</kbd>).</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Create Class</span> and the files should be created after file compilation is completed. Afterwards, Visual Studio should open (otherwise, open the solution by going to <span class="packt_screen">File | Open Visual Studio</span>), and will open up the <kbd>.cpp</kbd> file of the class we just created (<kbd>UserProfile.cpp</kbd>). Open the header rule (<kbd>UserProfile.h</kbd>) for your class and ensure your class file has the following form:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">#pragma once<br/><br/>#include "CoreMinimal.h"<br/>#include "UObject/NoExportTypes.h"<br/>#include "UserProfile.generated.h"<br/><br/>/**<br/> * <br/> */<br/>UCLASS()<br/>class CHAPTER_02_API UUserProfile : public UObject<br/>{<br/>  GENERATED_BODY()<br/>  <br/>};<br/><br/></pre>
<ol start="6">
<li>Compile and run your project. You can now use your custom <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> object inside Visual Studio, as well as inside the UE4 editor. See the following recipes for more details on what you can do with it.</li>

<p>UE4 generates and manages a significant amount of code for your custom <kbd>UCLASS</kbd>. This code is generated as a result of the use of the UE4 macros such as <kbd>UPROPERTY</kbd>, <kbd>UFUNCTION</kbd>, and the <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> macro itself. The generated code is put into <kbd>UserProfile.generated.h</kbd>. You must <kbd>#include</kbd> the <kbd>UCLASSNAME.generated.h</kbd> file with the <kbd>UCLASSNAME.h</kbd> file for compilation to succeed, which is why, by default, the editor includes this automatically. Without including the <kbd>UCLASSNAME.generated.h</kbd> file, compilation would fail.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that the <kbd>UCLASSNAME.generated.h</kbd> file must be included as the last <kbd>#include</kbd> in the list of <kbd>#include</kbd> in <kbd>UCLASSNAME.h</kbd>.</p>
<p>Here's a correct example:</p>
<pre>#pragma once<br/><br/>#include "CoreMinimal.h"<br/>#include "UObject/NoExportTypes.h"<br/><br/>#include &lt;list&gt; // Newly added include<br/><br/>// CORRECT: generated file is the last file included<br/>#include "UserProfile.generated.h"</pre>
<p>And here is an incorrect one:</p>
<pre>#pragma once<br/><br/>#include "CoreMinimal.h"<br/>#include "UObject/NoExportTypes.h"<br/>#include "UserProfile.generated.h"<br/><br/>// WRONG: NO INCLUDES AFTER .generated.h FILE<br/>#include &lt;list&gt; // Newly added include</pre>
<p>If the <kbd>UCLASSNAME.generated.h</kbd> file is not the last item within the list of <kbd>#include</kbd> statements shown in the previous code sample, you will get the following error:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt; #include found after .generated.h file - the .generated.h file <br/> should always be the last #include in a header</pre>

<p>There are a bunch of keywords that we want to discuss here, which modify the way a <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> behaves. A <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> can be marked as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>Blueprintable</kbd>: This means that you want to be able to construct a blueprint from the <span class="packt_screen">Class Viewer</span> inside the UE4 editor (when you right-click it, <span class="packt_screen">Create Blueprint Class...</span> becomes available). Without the <kbd>Blueprintable</kbd> keyword, the <span class="packt_screen">Create Blueprint Class...</span> option will not be available for your <kbd>UCLASS</kbd>, even if you can find it from within the <span class="packt_screen">Class Viewer</span> and right-click on it:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2c569908-51ef-4c1f-b399-4f45af55f714.jpg" style="width:48.92em;height:10.92em;"/></p>
<ul>
<li>The <span class="packt_screen">Create Blueprint Class...</span> option is only available if you specify <kbd>Blueprintable</kbd> in your <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> macro definition. </li>
<li><kbd>BlueprintType</kbd>: Using this keyword implies that the <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> is usable as a variable from another blueprint. You can create blueprint variables from the <span class="packt_screen">Variables</span> group in the left-hand panel of any blueprint's <span class="packt_screen">EventGraph</span>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><kbd>NotBlueprintType</kbd>: Using this keyword specifies that you cannot use this blueprint variable type as a variable in a blueprints diagram. Right-clicking the <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> name in the <span class="packt_screen">Class Viewer</span> will not show <span class="packt_screen">Create Blueprint Class...</span> in its context menu:</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/816ad77a-791c-42fc-b5dd-f517e92db546.jpg" style="width:16.75em;height:14.92em;"/></div>
<p>You may be unsure whether to declare your C++ class as a <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> or not. The general rule of thumb is to use <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> unless you have a good reason not to. Unreal Engine 4's code is very well-written and has been tested thoroughly by this point. If you like smart pointers, you may find that <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> not only makes for safer code, but also makes the entire code base more coherent and more consistent.</p>

<p>Blueprinting is just the process of deriving a blueprint class for your C++ object. Creating blueprint-derived classes from your UE4 objects allows you to edit the custom<span> </span><kbd>UPROPERTY</kbd><span> </span>visually inside the editor. This avoids hardcoding any resources into your C++ code. In addition, your C++ class to be placeable within the level, it must be blueprinted first. But this is only possible if the C++ class underlying the blueprint is an<span> </span><kbd>Actor</kbd><span> </span>class-derivative.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox"><span>There is a way to load resources (such as textures) using </span><kbd>FStringAssetReferences</kbd><span> and </span><kbd>StaticLoadObject</kbd><span>. These pathways to loading resources (by hardcoding path strings into your C++ code) are generally discouraged, however. Providing an editable value in a </span><kbd>UPROPERTY()</kbd><span> and loading from a proper concretely typed asset reference is a much better practice.</span></div>

<p>Any C++ class you create that has the<span> </span><kbd>Blueprintable</kbd><span> </span>tag in its<span> </span><kbd>UCLASS</kbd><span> </span>macro can be blueprinted within the UE4 editor.

<p>Each <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> that you declare can have any number of <kbd>UPROPERTY</kbd> declared for it within it. Each <kbd>UPROPERTY</kbd> can be a visually editable field, or a blueprints-accessible data member of the <kbd>UCLASS</kbd>.</p>
<p>There are a number of qualifiers that we can add to each <kbd>UPROPERTY</kbd>, which change the way it behaves from within the UE4 Editor, such as <kbd>EditAnywhere</kbd> (specifying that the <kbd>UPROPERTY</kbd> can be changed through code or in the editor), and <kbd>BlueprintReadWrite</kbd> (specifying that blueprints can both read and write the variable at any time, in addition to the C++ code being allowed to do so).</p>

<p>The parameters that are passed to the <kbd>UPROPERTY()</kbd> macro specify a couple of important pieces of information regarding the variable. In the preceding example, we specified the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>EditAnywhere</kbd>: This means that the property can be edited either directly from the Blueprint, or on each instance of the <kbd>UClass</kbd> object as placed<br/>
in the game level. Contrast this with the following:</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px"><kbd>EditDefaultsOnly</kbd>: The blueprint's value is editable, but it is not editable on a per-instance basis.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px"><kbd>EditInstanceOnly</kbd>: This would allow editing of the property in the game-level instances of the <kbd>UClass</kbd> object, and not on the base blueprint itself.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><kbd>BlueprintReadWrite</kbd>: This indicates that the property is both readable and writable from the blueprints diagrams. <kbd>UPROPERTY()</kbd> with <kbd>BlueprintReadWrite</kbd> must be public members; otherwise, compilation will fail. Contrast this with the following:</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px"><kbd>BlueprintReadOnly</kbd>: The property must be set from C++ and cannot be changed from the blueprints.</li>
<li><kbd>Category</kbd>: You should always specify a <kbd>Category</kbd> for your <kbd>UPROPERTY()</kbd> as it's a good practice to stay organized. The <kbd>Category</kbd> determines which submenu the <kbd>UPROPERTY()</kbd> will appear under in the property editor. All <kbd>UPROPERTY()</kbd> specified under <kbd>Category=Stats</kbd> will appear in the same <kbd>Stats</kbd> area in the blueprints editor. If no category is specified, the <kbd>UPROPERTY</kbd> will appear under the default category, <kbd>UserProfile</kbd> (or whatever one called their class).</li>
</ul>

<p>Accessing a <kbd>UPROPERTY</kbd> from blueprints is fairly simple. The member must be exposed as a <kbd>UPROPERTY</kbd> on the member variable that you want to access from your blueprints diagram. You must qualify the <kbd>UPROPERTY</kbd> in your macro declaration as being either <kbd>BlueprintReadOnly</kbd> or <kbd>BlueprintReadWrite</kbd> to specify whether you want the variable to be either readable (only) from Blueprints, or even writable from Blueprints.</p>
<p>You can also use the special value <kbd>BlueprintDefaultsOnly</kbd> to indicate that you only want the default value (before the game starts) to be editable from the blueprints editor. <kbd>BlueprintDefaultsOnly</kbd> indicates that the data member cannot be edited from Blueprints at runtime.</p>

<p>So, you've constructed some custom <kbd>UCLASS</kbd>, intended for use inside UE4. We created one in the editor using blueprints in the previous recipe, but how do you instantiate them in C++? Objects in UE4 are reference-counted and memory-managed objects, so you should not allocate them directly using the C++ keyword <kbd>new</kbd>. Instead, you'll have to use a function called <kbd>ConstructObject</kbd> so that we can instantiate your <kbd>UObject</kbd> derivative.</p>
<p><kbd>ConstructObject</kbd> doesn't just take the C++ class name of the object you are creating; it also requires a blueprint class derivative of the C++ class (a <kbd>UClass*</kbd> reference). A <kbd>UClass*</kbd> reference is just a pointer to a bluepri<span>nt.</span></p>
<p><span>How do we instantiate an instance of a particular blueprint from the C++ code? C++ code does not, and should not, know concrete</span> <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> <span>names, since these names are created and edited in the UE4 editor, which you can only access after compilation. We need a way to somehow hand back the blueprint class name to instantiate with the C++ code.</span></p>
<p>The way we do this is by having the UE4 programmer select the <kbd>UClass</kbd> that the C++ code is to use from a simple drop-down menu listing all the blueprints available (derived from a particular C++ class) inside the UE4 editor. To do this, we simply have to provide a user-editable <kbd>UPROPERTY</kbd> with a <kbd>TSubclassOf&lt;C++ClassName&gt;</kbd> typed variable. Alternatively, you can use <kbd>FStringClassReference</kbd> to achieve the same objective.</p>
<p> <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> should be considered as resources to the C++ code, and their names should never be hardcoded into the code base.</p>

<p>In your UE4 code, you're often going to need to refer to different <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> in the project. For example, say you need to know the <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> of the player object so that you can use <kbd>SpawnObject</kbd> in your code on it. Specifying a <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> from C++ code is extremely awkward, because the C++ code is not supposed to know about the concrete instances of the derived <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> that were created in the blueprints editor at all. Just as we don't want to bake specific asset names into the C++ code, we don't want to hardcode derived blueprints class names into the C++ code.</p>
<p>So, we use a C++ variable (for example, <kbd>UClassOfPlayer</kbd>), and select that from a blueprints dialog in the UE4 editor. You can do so using a <kbd>TSubclassOf</kbd> member or an <kbd>FStringClassReference</kbd> member.</p>

<p>The <kbd>TSubclassOf&lt; &gt;</kbd> member will allow you to specify a <kbd>UClass</kbd> name using a drop-down menu inside the UE4 editor when editing any blueprints that have <kbd>TSubclassOf&lt; &gt;</kbd> members.</p>

This limits the drop-down menu's contents to only the blueprints derived from that C++ class. You can leave the <kbd>MetaClass</kbd> tag out if you wish to display all the blueprints in the project.</p>

<p>Creating class instances in C++ is traditionally done using the keyword <kbd>new</kbd>. However, UE4 actually creates instances of its classes internally and requires you to call special factory functions to produce copies of any <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> that you want to instantiate. You produce instances of the UE4 blueprints classes, not the C++ class alone. When you create <kbd>UObject</kbd>-derived classes, you will need to instantiate them using special UE4 Engine functions.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The factory method allows UE4 to exercise some memory management on the object, controlling what happens to the object when it is deleted. This method allows UE4 to track all references to an object so that on object destruction, all references to the object can be easily unlinked. This ensures that no dangling pointers with references to invalidated memory exist in the program. This process is usually called <strong>garbage collection</strong>.</p>

<p>Instantiating <kbd>UObject</kbd>-derived classes that are not <kbd>AActor</kbd> class derivatives does not use <kbd>UWorld::SpawnActor&lt; &gt;</kbd>. Instead, we have to a special global function: <kbd>ConstructObject&lt; &gt;</kbd> or <kbd>NewObject&lt; &gt;</kbd>. Note that you should not use the bare C++ keyword <kbd>new</kbd> to allocate new instances of your UE4 <kbd>UObject</kbd> class derivatives.</p>
<p>You will need at least two pieces of information to properly instantiate your <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>A C++ typed <kbd>UClass</kbd> reference to the class type that you would like to instantiate (blueprint class)</li>
<li>The original C++ base class from which the blueprint class derives</li>
</ul>

<p>In a globally accessible object (such as your <kbd>GameMode</kbd> object), add a <kbd>TSubclassOf&lt; YourC++ClassName &gt; UPROPERTY()</kbd> to specify and supply the <kbd>UCLASS</kbd> name to your C++ code. To do this with the GameMode, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>From Visual Studio, open up the <kbd>Chapter02_GameModeBase.h</kbd> file from the <span class="packt_screen">Solution Explorer</span>. From there, update the script to the following:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">#pragma once<br/><br/>#include "CoreMinimal.h"<br/>#include "GameFramework/GameModeBase.h"<br/><strong>#include "UserProfile.h"</strong><br/>#include "Chapter_02GameModeBase.generated.h"<br/><br/>/**<br/> * <br/> */<br/>UCLASS()<br/>class CHAPTER_02_API AChapter_02GameModeBase : public AGameModeBase<br/>{<br/>  GENERATED_BODY()<br/><strong>  </strong><br/><strong>public:</strong><br/><strong>  UPROPERTY( EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = UClassNames ) </strong><br/><strong>  TSubclassOf&lt;UUserProfile&gt; UPBlueprintClassName;</strong> <br/>};</pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Save and compile your code.</li>
<li>From the UE4 editor, create a blueprint from this class. Double-click on it to enter the blueprints editor and then select your <kbd>UClass</kbd> name from the drop-down menu so that you can see what it does. Save and exit the editor:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/1fd16d87-b45d-4366-b178-bc8863d838b8.png" style="width:36.33em;height:36.92em;"/></p>

<pre style="padding-left: 60px">ObjectType* object = ConstructObject&lt; ObjectType &gt;( <br/> UClassReference );</pre>
<p>For example, using the <kbd>UserProfile</kbd> object that we specified in the last recipe, we would get code such as this:</p>
<pre>// Get the GameMode object, which has a reference to  
// the UClass name that we should instantiate: 
AChapter2GameMode *gm = Cast&lt;AChapter2GameMode&gt;( <br/>                                        GetWorld()-&gt;GetAuthGameMode()); <br/>if( gm )<br/>{<br/>  UUserProfile* newobject = NewObject&lt;UUserProfile&gt;(                                         <br/>                                      (UObject*)GetTransientPackage(), <br/>                                       UUserProfile::StaticClass() );<br/>}</pre>
<p>You can see an example of this being used in the <kbd>Chapter_02GameModeBase.cpp</kbd> file in this book's example code.</p>

<p>Instantiating a <kbd>UObject</kbd> class using <kbd>NewObject</kbd> is simple. <kbd>ConstructObject</kbd> will instantiate an object of the blueprint-class type, and return a C++ pointer of the correct type.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <kbd>NewObject</kbd> has a nasty first parameter that requires you to pass <kbd>GetTransientPackage()</kbd> with each call.</p>
<p>Do not use the keyword <kbd>new</kbd> when constructing your UE4 <kbd>UObject</kbd> derivative! It will not be properly memory-managed.</p>

<p>The <kbd>NewObject</kbd> function is what the OOP world refers to as a factory, and is a common design pattern. You ask the factory to make you the object; you don't go about constructing it by yourself. Using a factory pattern enables the engine to easily track objects as they are created.</p>

<p>Removing any <kbd>UObject</kbd> derivative is simple in UE4. When you are ready to delete your <kbd>UObject</kbd>-derived class, we will simply call a single function (<kbd>ConditionalBeginDestroy()</kbd>) on it to begin teardown. We do not use the native C++ <kbd>delete</kbd> command on <kbd>UObject</kbd> derivatives. We will show this in the following recipe.</p>

<p>The <kbd>ConditionalBeginDestroy()</kbd> function begins the destruction process by removing all internal engine linkages to it. This marks the object for destruction as far as the engine is concerned. The object is then destroyed some time later by destroying its internal properties, followed by actual destruction of the object.</p>
<p>After <kbd>ConditionalBeginDestroy()</kbd> has been called on an object, your (client) code must consider the object to be destroyed, and must no longer use it.</p>
<p>Actual memory recovery happens some time later than when <kbd>ConditionalBeginDestroy()</kbd> has been called on an object. There is a garbage collection routine that finishes clearing the memory of objects that are no longer referenced by the game program at fixed time intervals. The time interval between garbage collector calls is listed in <kbd>C:\Program Files (x86)\Epic Games\Launcher\Engine\Config\BaseEngine.ini</kbd>, and defaults to one collection every 61.1 seconds:</p>
<pre>gc.TimeBetweenPurgingPendingKillObjects=61.1</pre>
<div class="packt_tip"><span>If the memory seems low after several </span><kbd>ConditionalBeginDestroy()</kbd><span> calls, you can trigger memory cleanup by calling </span><kbd>GetWorld()-&gt;ForceGarbageCollection(true)</kbd><span> to force an internal memory cleanup.</span></div>
<p>Usually, you do not need to worry about garbage collection or the interval unless you urgently need memory cleared. Do not call garbage collection routines too often, as this may cause unnecessary lag in the game.</p>

<p>The main reason for making a struct, that is, a <kbd>USTRUCT()</kbd> instead of just a plain old C++ struct, is to interface with the UE4 Engine functionality. You can use plain C++ code (without creating <kbd>USTRUCT()</kbd> objects) for quick small structures that don't ask the engine to use them directly.</p>

<p>C++ <kbd>enum</kbd> instances are very useful in typical C++ code. UE4 has a custom type of enumeration called <kbd>UENUM()</kbd>, which allows you to create an <kbd>enum</kbd> that will show up in a drop-down menu inside a blueprint that you are editing.</p>

<p><kbd>UENUM()</kbd> shows up nicely in the code editor as a drop-down menu in the blueprints editor, from which you can only select one of a few values:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/ff0d78df-992a-47b1-bd70-9231db4839c7.png"/></p>
<p>As you can see, the values that were specified are there!</p>
