    until the semicolon at the end of the line. The lifetime of the stream needs to
    remain valid so that we can continue to use it to send the message and the additional
    text.

  zh: 你可以看到文件开头的空行。但每个消息仍然单独一行，调用者现在可以记录其他信息。让我们创建一个新的测试来确保这一点。新的测试将类似于以下示例：

  zh: '[PRE28]'
- en: This new test logs a double literal value directly and even logs the result
    of calling the `std::quoted` function. The `quoted` function just puts quotation
    marks around what is given to it. Even though the text “in quotes” already looks
    like it has quotation marks, remember that these marks are for the compiler to
    know when the text begins and ends. The quotation marks in the source code are
    not actually part of the text, just like how the quotation marks from the other
    string literals such as “double=” don’t appear in the log message. But because
    we call `std::quoted`, we will get quotation marks in the output.

  zh: 这个新的测试直接记录了双精度字面值，甚至记录了调用`std::quoted`函数的结果。`quoted`函数只是在其提供的文本周围加上引号。即使“引号中的文本”看起来已经有了引号，也要记住这些标记是为了让编译器知道文本的开始和结束。源代码中的引号实际上不是文本的一部分，就像其他字符串字面值（如“double=”）的引号不会出现在日志消息中一样。但因为我们调用了`std::quoted`，所以输出中会有引号。
- en: The interesting thing about `std::quoted` is that the return value can really
    only be used to send to a stream. The actual type is undefined by the C++ standard,
    and the only requirement is that it can be sent to a stream.

  zh: '`std::quoted`函数的有趣之处在于，其返回值实际上只能用于发送到流中。其实际类型由C++标准未定义，唯一的要求是它可以发送到流。'

    example shows what the `application.log` file looks like after deleting it and
    running the tests a couple of times:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 构建和运行项目显示这两个测试都通过了。以下示例展示了在删除`application.log`文件并运行几次测试后，该文件看起来像什么：

- en: We now have the ability to create log messages with timestamps, save them to
    a log file, and can send whatever data we want to each log message. The usage
    is simple and intuitive for C++ developers who are already familiar with sending
    information to a stream such as `std::cout`.

  zh: 现在我们有了创建带时间戳的日志消息、将它们保存到日志文件，并将我们想要发送到每个日志消息中的任何数据的能力。对于已经熟悉向`std::cout`等流发送信息的C++开发者来说，这种用法简单直观。

- en: In this chapter, you learned how to use the unit test library to begin a new
    project using TDD. Even though we only have two tests, we already have a working
    logging library that is easy to use and understandable by any C++ developer.

  zh: 在本章中，你学习了如何使用单元测试库通过TDD（测试驱动开发）开始一个新的项目。尽管我们只有两个测试，但我们已经拥有了一个易于使用且任何C++开发者都能理解的日志库。
- en: The two tests will help ensure we don’t break the simple design started in this
    chapter as we extend the logging library in later chapters. The next chapter,
    in particular, will extend the logging library to better fit the needs of our
    intended user, a micro-services developer. We’ll be adding the ability to tag
    log messages and then use the tags to enable powerful filtering options.

  zh: 这两个测试将有助于确保我们在后续章节扩展日志库时不会破坏本章开始时启动的简单设计。特别是下一章将扩展日志库以更好地满足我们目标用户（微服务开发者）的需求。我们将添加标记日志消息的能力，然后使用这些标记启用强大的过滤选项。
