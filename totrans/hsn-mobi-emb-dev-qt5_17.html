                    <h1 class="header-title">Deploying to Mobile and Embedded</h1>
                </header>

<p class="mce-root">Mobile phones, tablets, and watches have their platform ways to deploy apps—usually through an app store. Deploying plugins and other libraries needs special attention. In this chapter, we will discuss alternative OSes, such as Jolla's Sailfish OS, as embedded devices have several options. I use a Raspberry Pi as an example for embedded Linux devices.</p>
<p>For the major mobile phone app stores, you will need to digitally sign your package with a security certificate, which the systems use as a way to identify the author enough to trust the application.</p>
<p>A certificate involves a public-private key pair. The private key is just that. You keep that private. The public certificate is publicly distributable. I won't go into the cryptography involved here. Qt Creator calls these certificates the keystore and you can use Qt Creator to generate these self-signed certificates.</p>
<p>We will examine the following deployment targets:</p>
<ul>
<li>For Android</li>
<li>For iOS</li>
<li><span>For a</span>lternative OSes</li>
<li>For embedded Linux</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_tip">Keep backups of your digital certificates as you will not be able to update your applications in the stores if you lose them.</div>

<p>Android does not need <span>Google Play Store </span>to install apps; it's just most convenient. There are other marketplaces to choose from, such as Aptoid, Yandex, F-Droid, and Amazon.</p>
<p>You can also sideload apps. Sideloading is installing an app by transferring the package by USB, memory card, or over the internet, without the use of the official store.</p>
<p>Qt Creator technically can sideload the package of the application you are working on. It can install the package, or simply run the executable on the device without installing it.</p>
<p>Essentially, you can put a package file on your web server, have people download it to their phones or computers, and let them manually install it.</p>
<p>You could also make it available on Google Play Store, by officially publishing it. You need to be able to sign it with a certificate that you get from your developer account. This certificate for Android does not need to be signed by a certificate authority, but can be self-signed. </p>

<p>After developing and testing your application, you will need to make a package so people can install it. There are a few ways to make a package, via Qt Creator or by the command line. </p>

<p>The command line tool named <kbd>androiddeployqt</kbd> comes with Qt Creator for the Android SDK. This is a command line tool to help build and sign an Android package. To view its help output, run <kbd>/path/to/<span>androiddeployqt --help</span></kbd>. I am not going to go into the command line deployment other than to say it is available to use.</p>

<p>Digital certificates in Qt Creator are handled on the <span class="packt_screen">Build Settings</span> page for your projects. Now, let's build:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Projects</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Build</span> will get you to the <span class="packt_screen">Build Settings</span> page. If you are making a release, make sure your project is in <span class="packt_screen">Release</span> mode from the top of this page:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/cc60086f-401b-4dae-bae2-f8d9b9ee95d7.png" style="width:31.67em;height:5.92em;"/></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Build Steps</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Build Android APK</span>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/4259b16a-acac-4ecd-878c-a2cda549bed9.png" style="width:33.83em;height:46.33em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ol start="3">
<li>You will need to click on <span class="packt_screen">Create Templates</span>, which will create the <kbd>manifest.xml</kbd> file needed for the store. The two main entries are <span class="packt_screen">Package name</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Application icon</span>. I used Android Studio to create different sized icons, because it was the most efficient at creating several icons at once. I started with a large PNG. Be sure to select the correct <span class="packt_screen">SDK</span> versions, or it will become an issue later on:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b520da3d-9632-4120-b084-c8845de0a982.png"/></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>You also need to generate certificates. In the <span class="packt_screen">Build Steps</span> page, find the <span class="packt_screen">S</span><span class="packt_screen">ign package</span> section. The button on the very right of the <span class="packt_screen">Keystore</span> entry, which says <span class="packt_screen">Create...</span>, will bring up this dialog:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/5229d052-7a5a-4fde-91e5-9478eb6286a7.png" style="width:35.25em;height:34.08em;"/></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>You will need to supply a <span class="packt_screen">Password</span> for both <span class="packt_screen">Keystore</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Certificate</span>, which are the private and public keys.</li>
<li>You also need to supply your <span class="packt_screen">name</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Organization</span>, <span class="packt_screen">City</span>, <span class="packt_screen">State</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Two-letter country code</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do another build and it will create a signed Android package that you can install or upload to the store. You are now ready to test your app in a closed, internal, or open test track. Qt Creator will not help you there.</p>

<p>You can have up to 100 internal testers. To create a testers list on Play Console, navigate to:</p>
<p><span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Manage testers</span> | <span class="packt_screen">CREATE LIST</span></p>
<p>You will need to provide the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">List name</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Email addresses</span> (you can upload a csv email list too!)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can then add testers to an app (which you may or may not have previously added). Now select your app and navigate to <span class="packt_screen">App releases</span>, and select one of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Internal</span>: An internal closed track</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Alpha</span>: A closed track</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Beta</span>: An open track</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Production</span>: Release</li>
</ul>
<p>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Manage (Internal)</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Create Release</span></p>
<p>You need to make sure your account is set up, by providing the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Store Listing—screenshots
<ul>
<li>Hi-res icon (512 x 512 png)</li>
<li>Feature Graphic (1,024 x 500 jpg, png)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Content rating</li>
<li>Pricing and distribution</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to upload an app package before you add testers. Once you upload your package app, you will need to select <span class="packt_screen"><span class="packt_screen">Review</span>.</span></p>
<p>You will then be asked to select your testers list when you navigate back to the <span class="packt_screen">App releases</span> page. You should receive a URL to share with your tester that they can use to download and install your internally-tested application package.</p>
<p><span>That </span>red icon at the top of the page<span> means something needs to be checked.:</span></p>

<p>In my case, I hadn't actually selected any testers to this release yet.</p>
<p>When you add to the list of testers, it should look similar to this:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/441ba5b3-76aa-4d6b-9edb-528f92d0eef1.png" style="width:38.25em;height:25.08em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Here is what your testers will see in the <span class="packt_screen">Google Play</span> Store:</p>

<p>Deployment on iOS is very similar, so let's look at that.</p>

<p>The iOS store is perhaps the most restrictive and complicated of all the mobile app stores to submit an app to. <span>It also has more exhaustive submission guidelines, such as: it should not replicate the functionality of native applications. The process to get to the point of submitting an app is also more complicated.</span></p>

<p>Qt Creator comes with support for creating and signing iOS packages. As with Android, you will need certificates from your developer account. This is what you see when you log into the developer account at Apple:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/8e06b7cc-dbe1-4bd2-a8bb-bdac7e502927.png" style="width:43.75em;height:20.17em;"/></p>
<p>Once in your developer account, click on the icon labelled <span class="packt_screen">Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles</span> to add certificates. Notice the list under <span class="packt_screen">Certificates</span> at the left:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/1158d39c-545e-4369-bf22-811bb0495ec9.png" style="width:11.83em;height:19.00em;"/></p>
<p>There are two types of <span class="packt_screen">Certificates</span>: <span class="packt_screen">Development</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Production</span>. <span class="packt_screen">Production</span> certificates are for release distribution. If you do not have <span class="packt_screen">Production</span> certificates, add one now by clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">+</span> icon:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/6676edda-60b5-4633-be35-477b482d7f44.png" style="width:34.50em;height:3.67em;"/></p>
<p>That will open up the following dialog:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f614f553-fa2b-4d3d-8530-97cd0913a7b2.png" style="width:45.67em;height:38.00em;"/></p>
<p>Select <span class="packt_screen">App Store and Ad Hoc</span>. <span class="packt_screen">Ad Hoc</span> means you can only install this on a few testing devices.</p>
<p>Next, under <span class="packt_screen">Identifiers</span>, select <strong><span class="packt_screen">App IDs</span></strong>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/32808075-68c2-4024-b4cf-66a13b2a9dd4.png" style="width:12.92em;height:13.25em;"/></p>
<p>There are two types of <span class="packt_screen">App IDs</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Wildcard</em>, which can be used for multiple apps if they do not require iCloud or in-app purchases.</li>
<li><em>Explicit</em>, which is used for in-app purchases per application. You will need one of these for each app you have that uses in-app purchasing.</li>
</ul>
<p>You also need <span class="packt_screen">P<span class="packt_screen">rovisioning Profiles</span></span>: </p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/e7736952-884c-44cb-9ab1-58abd4ae3da3.png" style="width:40.92em;height:43.83em;"/></p>
<p>As you can see here, there are different types of provisioning profiles. Under <span class="packt_screen">Distribution</span>, select <span class="packt_screen">App Store</span> <span>then the <span class="packt_screen">Continue</span> button at the bottom of the page. </span>Select the <span class="packt_screen">App ID</span> you created previously. Select the <span class="packt_screen">Certificate</span> also previously created. You will need to name this profile, and it <span>must match the <span class="packt_screen">Bundle Identifier</span> for your package</span>. Download this and put it somewhere you remember; you will need this to sign the app through XCode. </p>
<p>You will also need an App ID, so select <span class="packt_screen">App IDs</span> from the left and create a new one. </p>
<p>Now we can sign a release mode package.</p>

<p>From the build directory, open the resulting <kbd>&lt;target&gt;.xcodeproj</kbd> in Xcode. Select the project from the left to open up the project settings.</p>
<p>Click on <span class="packt_screen">General</span> and then unselect <span class="packt_screen">Automatically manage signing</span> to be able to manually select the package signing:</p>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Your <span class="packt_screen">Bundle Identifier</span> must match the name of the provisioning profile. If it doesn't, it will alert you:</p>

<p>Test and build the package. It should ask you for your administrator password when it signs the package.</p>
<p>To build a release mode package, navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Product</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Scheme</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Edit Scheme</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Info</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Build Configuration</span>.</p>
<p>Select <span class="packt_screen">Release</span> and then build the package.</p>
<p>From here, you need to grab your web browser again and navigate to the <span class="packt_screen">App Store Connect</span>, select <strong><span class="packt_screen">My Apps</span></strong>, and click on the <span class="packt_screen">+</span> to create a <span class="packt_screen">New App</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/275b8f25-d0f2-4a9d-96f9-3fc5f5e3f244.png"/></p>
<p>From here, fill out <span class="packt_screen">App Information</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Pricing, and Availability</span>.</p>
<p>Next, add screenshots, icons, store text, and other items for the apps page and the App Store.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">To upload your app from Xcode, select <span class="packt_screen">Product</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Archive.</span></p>
<p>This will create the package and open the <span class="packt_screen">Archives</span> window.</p>
<p>You should validate the package before uploading it to the App Store, so select <span class="packt_screen">Validate App</span>, then select <span class="packt_screen">profile</span> and the <span class="packt_screen">certificates</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/718f21e1-6790-42ff-965b-ebe8a3854b06.png"/></p>
<p>Fix any issues you may have. This also includes adding screenshots, app icons, and so on for the storefront for the app. Then you can click the <span class="packt_screen">Distribute App</span> button.</p>

<p>There are other mobile and embedded OSes available that you may or may not have heard about, such as my favorite alternative mobile OS: Jolla's Sailfish. Another operating system is UBports, which is an Open Source version of Canonical's now-defunct mobile phone OS, Ubuntu Touch.</p>

<p>Sailfish OS is a continuation of Nokia's MeeGo, which was a continuation of Maemo.</p>
<p>The UI is developed by Jolla, and the base OS is open source Mer, which is developed by Jolla and the community.</p>
<p>Jolla has an app store they named Harbour (<a href="http://harbour.jolla.com">http://harbour.jolla.com</a>). At this time, you cannot sell apps through this app store:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/3b80ce25-022e-4522-a811-993aede9f94f.png"/></p>
<p>This is what my developer page looks like:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/53a4b008-a2bc-48d5-afb7-d455b8db017d.png"/></p>
<p>Yes, it has been five years since I have updated it.</p>
<p>You can install Jolla onto certain Android phones—or if you are lucky enough to have actual Jolla hardware or perhaps a phone that comes with Jolla installed, you have access to Harbour through the Store app. Here is the view of the <span class="packt_screen">Top apps</span> page:</p>

<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/bdb1a474-9b30-45d3-aba4-38eba4e03350.png" style="width:19.83em;height:35.08em;"/></p>
<p>I need to download the Application SDK from <a href="https://releases.sailfishos.org/sdk/installers/1.24/">https://releases.sailfishos.org/sdk/installers/1.24/</a>.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>I install it on my Linux development machine as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>chmod +x SailfishOSSDK-Beta-1.24-Qt5-linux-64-offline.run</strong><br/><strong>./SailfishOSSDK-Beta-1.24-Qt5-linux-64-offline.run</strong> </pre>
<p><span>The <span class="packt_screen">Sailfish OS SDK</span> is now installed!</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/30c4bfde-de9d-466f-8a16-e5dd16b3c58b.png" style="width:40.00em;height:36.17em;"/></p>
<p>After Qt Creator opens with the Sailfish SDK, click on <span class="packt_screen">Sailfish OS</span> from the icons on the left:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/3002229b-0519-4003-bb03-c529c33f21a0.png" style="width:5.58em;height:32.83em;"/></p>
<p>You should see a message that says that the build engine is not running, so we need to start it. Click on <span class="packt_screen">Start the build engine!</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/376220ef-6daf-42ff-9aa0-1ac9555d8342.png"/></p>
<p>Once you do that, you get into the <span class="packt_screen">Sailfish Control Centre</span>, where you can add components into the SDK, and apply updates if needed.</p>
<p>Set up your device, if you have one, and navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Tools</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Options</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Dev</span><span class="packt_screen">ices.</span></p>
<p>Once there, click on <span class="packt_screen">Tools</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Options</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Kits</span> and select the <span class="packt_screen">armv7hl</span> kit.</p>
<p>In the <span class="packt_screen">Devices</span> options section, make sure that the Jolla device that you set up previously is selected and not the emulator, unless that is what you want to run the app on.</p>
<p>The Jolla SDK build engine runs in a Virtual machine, so it can be used from any platform. The IDE it uses is Qt Creator. Jolla is unique in that you can run native apps for Jolla OS, but also it can run Android Apps. The gotcha about Android support is that there is no Google Play API.</p>
<p>Now that the build engine (cross compiler) is running, we can build our app, test, and then make a package to upload to Harbour.</p>
<p>From the <span class="packt_screen">Projects</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Run</span> settings, make sure either <span class="packt_screen">Deploy by Copying Binaries</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Deploy As RPM Package</span> is selected for <span class="packt_screen">Method</span>. If you are running it without installing a package, select the <span class="packt_screen">Copying</span> method. Here is my updated <span class="packt_screen">Compass</span> app running on the Jolla phone:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/5a2051d2-468b-4d36-9967-91fa018c8463.png" style="width:10.58em;height:18.83em;"/></p>
<p>Once you have built the release package, navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Sailfish OS</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Publishing</span>, click on the <span class="packt_screen">RPM</span> validator, and select your package file to validate.</p>
<p>The Jolla Store interface is the least complicated of the mobile app stores here, in part because there are no sales of apps.</p>
<p>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Add app</span>. You will have to fill out the following: </p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Title</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Details</span>:
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">description</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">summary</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">recent changes</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Categorization</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Compatibility</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Visual Assts (screenshots, icons)</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Contact details</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Any message to QA</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you submit your application to Jolla's Harbour store, you will see something like this image:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/4e5fb11b-d6c6-49fa-9c70-04f850fd776c.png" style="width:52.25em;height:32.67em;"/></p>
<p>QA will check the package and either reject or accept it.</p>

<p><span>UBports is a convergent OS based on Canonical's now-defunct mobile offering, Ubuntu Touch. Convergent means it is designed to run on desktops and mobile devices. It runs on various mobile phones and tablets, and the UI is based on Qt and QML. I run mine on a Nexus 4. I won't go into detail, but I did wanted to mention it. More information can be found on: </span><a href="https://ubports.com/"><span>https://ubports.com/</span></a></p>
<p>There is a simple installer for putting UBports on a supported device at <a href="https://ubuntu-touch.io/get-ut">https://ubuntu-touch.io/get-ut</a>.</p>
<p>You can grab the SDK at <a href="https://docs.ubports.com/en/latest/appdev/index.html">https://docs.ubports.com/en/latest/appdev/index.html</a>.</p>

<p>The UBports SDK produces click packages from the command line. The Ubuntu Touch SDK IDE is no longer supported by Canonical or UBports. The store is called <span>OpenStore. You need an account, and the URL to submit apps is </span><a href="https://open-store.io/submit">https://open-store.io/submit</a>.</p>

<p>Embedded Linux devices come in many different sizes and varieties. Some may have app stores, but most don't. There are various methods to get the OS and apps on the devices.</p>

<p>The deployment of the operating system will on your device, as some embedded devices have very specific methods in which the operating system is deployed to the device. In the case of Raspberry Pi, it is easy to copy the image to an SD card and put that into the RPI and boot it up.</p>
<p>I have a script named <kbd>writeIso</kbd> that I use; it consists of two lines:</p>
<pre>#!/bin/bash<br/>sudo dd if=$1 of=$2 bs=4M status=progress</pre>
<p>I run it something like this:</p>
<p><kbd>./writeIso /path/to/deviceImage.img /dev/sdc</kbd></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Other devices may have a <kbd>flash</kbd> method, whereby the image gets copied directly onto the device. This can be as low-level as having to use JTAG, or it could be higher-level, such as using Android's <kbd>adb</kbd> command. Sometimes, you have to write the image to an SD card, put that into the device, and then, with some combination of keys or buttons, flash that image into the machine's ROM.</p>

<p>With a distribution with a package manager such as Raspbian or Yocto, you can easily distribute your application, either by installing directly on the device or adding to the package repository. In the case of Yocto, you can have a local repository to distribute.</p>
<p>To get the package file onto the device, you can use Qt Creator and set up a generic Linux device. This requires an SSH server running on the device and some kind of network connection.</p>
<p>You can also use the <kbd>scp</kbd> command to copy packages and/or binaries to the device. This also requires an SSH server.</p>

<p>There are a few different methods for OS and app deployment. Mobile phones have app stores, which also have various methods to submit apps. Usually, these are done though a web browser. You should be able to publish apps to the Android, iOS, and alternative OS, such as Jolla's Sailfish, app stores.</p>
<p>You should also be able to distribute your app onto embedded devices, such as Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In the next chapter, we will traverse into the brand new technology of Qt for WebAssembly that allows Qt applications to run in a web browser.</p>
