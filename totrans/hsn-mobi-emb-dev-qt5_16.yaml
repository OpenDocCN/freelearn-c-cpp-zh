    we will go through the steps needed to set up a cross compiler on Linux. Mobile
    phone platforms have their own ways of development, which will also be discussed.
    You will learn to compile cross-platforms for a different device and debug remotely
    via a network or USB connection. We will go through various mobile platforms.

    `toolchain` with their software stack. Of course, if you are building your own
    hardware, or just want to create your own cross `toolchain`, there are other options.
    You can download a prebuilt cross `toolchain` for your device's architecture,
    or you can build it yourself. If you do end up compiling the `toolchain`, you
    will need a fast and robust machine with a lot of disk space, as it will take
    quite a long time to finish and use a lot of filesystem—easily 50 GB if you build
    the entire system.

    and then you can inspect that wonderful backtrace! From here, you can hopefully
    gather enough clues to fix it.

- en: Debugging is a powerful process and often required to fix bugs. You can either
    run debuggers such as `gdb` from the command line, or you should be able to connect
    the `gdb` to a debugger server running on a remote device. Running a GUI-based
    debugger is much more fun. You should be able to debug your Qt app running on
    your mobile or embedded device from Qt Creator over a remote connection.
