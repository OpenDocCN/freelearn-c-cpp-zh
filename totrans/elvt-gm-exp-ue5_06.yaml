    namely Line Traces and Sweep Traces. We learned how to execute different types
    of Line Traces, how to create custom Trace Channels, and how to change how an
    object responds to a specific channel. Many of the things you learned in the previous
    chapter will be used in this chapter, where we’ll learn about object collision.

    game by adding game mechanics that revolve around object collision. We will create
    the Dodgeball actor, which will act as a dodgeball that bounces off of the floor
    and walls; the Wall actor, which will block all objects; the Ghost Wall actor,
    which will only block the player, not the enemies’ lines of sight or the dodgeball;
    and the Victory Box actor, which will end the game when the player enters the
    Victory Box, representing the end of the level.

    between multiple objects, as explained in the previous chapter. Collision is the
    backbone of most games released nowadays, whether 2D or 3D. In many games, it’s
    the main way in which the player acts upon the environment, be it running, jumping,
    or shooting, and the environment acts accordingly by making the player land, get
    hit, and so on. It is no understatement to say that, without simulated collision,
    it wouldn’t be possible to make many games at all.

    response from the query aspect; however, although they are both physical responses,
    they will cause objects to behave differently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The physical response from the physics aspect (physics simulation) only applies
    when an object is simulating physics (for example, being affected by gravity,
    bouncing off the walls and ground, and so on). Such an object, when hitting a
    wall, for instance, will bounce back and continue moving in another direction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, the physical response from the query aspect applies to all
    objects that don’t simulate physics. An object can move without simulating physics
    when being controlled by code (for example, by using the `SetActorLocation` function
    or by using the **Character Movement** component). In this case, depending on
    which method you use to move the object and its properties, when an object hits
    a wall, it will simply stop moving instead of bouncing back. This is because you’re
    simply telling the object to move in a certain direction and something is blocking
    its path, so the physics engine doesn’t allow that object to continue moving.

    every game development tool must have a way for you to cause a delay, or a wait
    time, before something happens. For instance, when you’re playing an online deathmatch
    game, where your character can die and then respawn, usually, the respawn event
    doesn’t happen the instant your character dies but a few seconds later. There
    is a multitude of scenarios where you want something to happen, but only after
    a certain amount of time. This will be the case for our `EnemyCharacter`, which
    will be throwing dodgeballs every few seconds. This delay, or wait time, can be
    achieved through timers.
  prefs: []

    a new activity, but first, we’ll need to make some modifications to our `DodgeballProjectile`
    class, namely adding a getter function to its `ProjectileMovementComponent`. We’ll
    do this in the next exercise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A getter function is a function that only returns a specific property and does
    nothing else. These functions are usually marked as inline, which means that when
    the code compiles, a call to that function will simply be replaced with its content.
    They are also usually marked as `const`, given that they don’t modify any of the
    class’s properties.

    `getter` function to our `DodgeballProjectile` class, which we will be using in
    this chapter’s activity, where we’ll replace the `SpawnActor` function within
    the `EnemyCharacter` class with the `SpawnActorDeferred` function. This will allow
    us to safely edit our `DodgeballProjectile` class’s properties before we spawn
    an instance of it.

    function to use the `SpawnActorDeferred` function instead of the `SpawnActor`
    function so that we can change the DodgeballProjectile’s `InitialSpeed` before
    spawning it.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because the `SpawnActorDeferred` function can’t just receive a spawn location
    and rotation properties and must receive an `FTransform` property instead, we’ll
    need to create one of those before we call that function. Let’s call it `SpawnTransform`
    and send the spawn rotation and location, in that order, as inputs for its constructor,
    which will be this enemy’s rotation and the `SpawnLocation` property, respectively.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, update the `SpawnActor` function call in the `SpawnActorDeferred` function
    call. Instead of sending the spawn location and spawn rotation as its second and
    third parameters, replace those with the `SpawnTransform` properties we just created,
    as the second parameter.

    property called `Projectile`.

    object. However, we still need to change its `InitialSpeed` property and spawn
    it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you’ve called the `SpawnActorDeferred` function, call the `Projectile`
    property’s `GetProjectileMovementComponent` function, which returns its `ProjectileMovementComponent`,
    and change its `InitialSpeed` property to `2200` units.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because we’ll be accessing properties that belong to `ProjectileMovementComponent`
    inside the `EnemyCharacter` class, we’ll need to include that component, just
    like we did in *Exercise 6.02 – adding a ProjectileMovementComponent to DodgeballProjectile*.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you’ve changed the value of the `InitialSpeed` property, the only thing
    left to do is call the `Projectile` property’s `FinishSpawning` function, which
    will receive the `SpawnTransform` property we created as a parameter.
