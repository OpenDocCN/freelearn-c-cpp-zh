<h1 id="_idParaDest-314"><a id="_idTextAnchor921"/>Making C++ Safer</h1>
<p><a id="_idTextAnchor922"/>This bonus chapter will add insight into what we can do as C++ programmers to make the language as safe as possible in our everyday usage. We have progressed from basic language features to our core interest of OO programming with C++, to additional useful language features and libraries (exceptions, operator overloading, templates, and STL), to design patterns to give us a knowledge base to solve recurring types of OO programming problems. At every point along the way, we’ve seen that C++ requires extra care on our part to avoid tricky and potentially problematic programming situations. C++ is a language that will allow us to do anything, but with this power comes the need for guidelines to ensure our programming follows safe practices. After all, our goal is to create programs that will run successfully without errors and, additionally, be easy to maintain. The ability of C++ to do anything needs to be paired with sound practices to simply make C++ safer.</p>
<p>The goal of this chapter is to revisit topics that we have covered in previous chapters, reviewing them with an eye toward safety. We will also incorporate topics strongly related to ones we have seen previously. This chapter is not meant to cover wholly new topics or previous topics in great depth, but to provide a grouping of safer programming practices and the encouragement to seek further information on each topic as needed. Some of these topics can encompass entire chapters (or books) themselves!</p>
<p>In this bonus chapter, we will cover selected popular programming conventions to meet our safety challenge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revisiting smart pointers (unique, shared, and weak), as well as a complementary idiom (RAII)</li>
<li>Using modern <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loops (range-based, for-each) to avoid common errors</li>
<li>Adding type safety: usage of <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> instead of explicit typing</li>
<li>Preferring usage of STL types for simple containers (<strong class="source-inline">std::vector</strong>, and so on)</li>
<li>Utilizing <strong class="source-inline">const</strong> appropriately to ensure non-modification of select items</li>
<li>Understanding thread safety issues</li>
<li>Considering core programming guideline essentials, such as preferring initialization to assignment, or choosing only one of <strong class="source-inline">virtual</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">override</strong>, or <strong class="source-inline">final</strong></li>
<li>Adopting C++ core programming guidelines for safety (build and assemble one, if necessary)</li>
<li>Understanding resources for programming safety in C++ </li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of this chapter, you will understand some of the current industry standards and concerns for programming safely in C++. This chapter is not meant to be a comprehensive list of all safety concerns and practices in C++, but to showcase the types of issues you will need to become mindful of as a successful C++ programmer. In some cases, you may desire to investigate a topic more deeply to gain a more thorough level of competence and proficiency. Adding safety to your C++ programming will make you a more valuable programmer, as your code will be more reliable and have more longevity and success.</p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-316"><a id="_idTextAnchor924"/><a id="_idTextAnchor925"/><a id="_idTextAnchor926"/>Revisiting smart pointers</h1>
<p>Throughout the book, we have developed a reasonable<a id="_idIndexMarker1325"/> understanding of how to use raw or native C++ pointers, including the associated memory allocation and deallocation for heap instances. We have persevered through native C++ pointers because they are pervasive in existing C++ code. Having knowledge of how to properly utilize native pointers is essential in working with the volume of existing C++ code currently in use. But, for newly created code, there is a safer way to manipulate heap memory.</p>
<p>We have seen that dynamic memory management<a id="_idIndexMarker1326"/> with native pointers is a lot of work! Especially when there may be multiple pointers to the same chunk of memory. We’ve talked about reference counting to shared resources (such as heap memory) and mechanisms for deleting memory when all instances are done with the shared memory. We also know that memory deallocation can easily be overlooked, leading to memory leakage.</p>
<p>We have also seen, firsthand, that errors with native pointers can be costly. Our programs can end abruptly when we dereference memory we don’t intend to access, or when we dereference uninitialized native pointers (interpreting the memory to contain a valid address and meaningful data at that address—neither of which are actually valid). Pointer arithmetic to walk through memory can be laden with errors by an otherwise adept programmer. When a memory error is made, pointer or heap memory misuse are often the culprits. </p>
<p>Certainly, using references can ease the burden of many errors with native pointers. But references can still point to dereferenced heap memory that someone forgets to deallocate. For these and many other reasons, smart pointers have become popular in C++ with the primary purpose of making C++ safer. </p>
<p>We’ve talked about smart pointers in previous chapters and have seen them in action with our pImpl pattern (using <strong class="source-inline">unique_ptr</strong>). But there are more types of smart pointers for us to review in addition to unique: shared and weak. Let’s also make a programming premise (a future style guide addition) to prefer smart pointers in our newly created code to native pointers for the purpose and value of pointer safety.</p>
<p>Recall that a <strong class="bold">smart pointer</strong> is a small wrapper class that encapsulates a raw or native pointer, ensuring that the pointer it contains is automatically deleted when the wrapper object goes out of scope. The Standard C++ Library implementations of <em class="italic">unique</em>, <em class="italic">shared</em>, and <em class="italic">weak</em> smart pointers use templates to create a specific category of smart pointer for any data type. </p>
<p>Though we could devote an entire chapter to each type of smart pointer in depth, we will review each type briefly as a starting point to encourage their usage in newly created code to support our goal of making C++ safer. </p>
<p>Now, let’s revisit each type of smart pointer, one by one.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-317">Using smart pointers – uniqu<a id="_idTextAnchor927"/>e</h2>
<p>Recall that a <strong class="bold">unique pointer</strong>, specified as <strong class="source-inline">unique_ptr</strong> in the Standard<a id="_idIndexMarker1327"/> C++ Library, is a type<a id="_idIndexMarker1328"/> of smart pointer that encapsulates exclusive ownership and access to a given heap memory resource. A <strong class="source-inline">unique_ptr</strong> cannot be duplicated; the owner of a <strong class="source-inline">unique_ptr</strong> will have sole use of that pointer. Owners of unique pointers can choose to move these pointers to other resources, but the repercussions are that the original resource will no longer contain <strong class="source-inline">unique_ptr</strong>. Recall that we must use <strong class="source-inline">#include &lt;memory&gt;</strong> to include the definition for <strong class="source-inline">unique_ptr</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is a very simple example illustrating how to create unique pointers. This example can be found in our GitHub repository:</p>

    return 0;
}</pre>
<p>First, notice that because<a id="_idIndexMarker1329"/> we included <strong class="source-inline">using std::unique_ptr;</strong>, we did not need<a id="_idIndexMarker1330"/> to qualify <strong class="source-inline">unique_ptr</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">make_unique</strong> with <strong class="source-inline">std::</strong> in the unique pointer declarations. In this small program, we create several unique pointers, starting with one to point to an integer, <strong class="source-inline">p1</strong>, and one to point to an instance of a <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">pers1</strong>. Each of these variables has exclusive use of the heap memory each points to because we are using unique pointers. </p>
<p>Next, we introduce a unique pointer, <strong class="source-inline">pers2</strong>, that takes over the memory originally allocated and linked to <strong class="source-inline">pers1</strong> using <strong class="source-inline">pers2 = move(pers1);</strong>. The original variable no longer has access to this memory. Note that though we could have allocated <strong class="source-inline">pers2</strong> to have its own, unique heap memory, we instead chose to demonstrate how to allow one unique pointer to relinquish its memory to another unique pointer using <strong class="source-inline">move()</strong>. Changing the ownership of unique pointers with <strong class="source-inline">move()</strong> is typical, as unique pointers cannot be copied (because that would allow two or more pointers to share the same memory and, therefore, not be unique!) </p>
<p>Finally, we create another<a id="_idIndexMarker1331"/> unique pointer, <strong class="source-inline">pers3</strong>, that utilizes <strong class="source-inline">make_unique</strong> as a wrapper<a id="_idIndexMarker1332"/> to allocate the heap memory for the unique pointer that <strong class="source-inline">pers3</strong> will represent. The preference for using <strong class="source-inline">make_unique</strong> is that the call to <strong class="source-inline">new()</strong> will be made internally, on our behalf. Additionally, any exceptions thrown during the construction of the object will be handled for us, as will any call to <strong class="source-inline">delete()</strong>, should the underlying <strong class="source-inline">new()</strong> not complete successfully and a call to <strong class="source-inline">delete()</strong> is then warranted. </p>
<p>The heap memory will be managed for us automatically; this is one of the benefits of using a smart pointer. </p>
<p>Here is the output for our <strong class="source-inline">unique_ptr</strong> example:</p>
<p class="source-code">100</p>
<p class="source-code">Dr. Renee K. Alexander</p>
<p class="source-code">Dr. Renee K. Alexander</p>
<p class="source-code">Ms. Giselle LeBrun</p>
<p class="source-code">Person destructor</p>
<p class="source-code">Person destructor</p>
<p>Under the hood, the destructor will automatically be called for each object pointed to by a smart pointer, when the memory is no longer utilized. In the case of this example, the destructor for each <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> object is called on our behalf when the local objects in <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> go out of scope and are popped off the stack. Note that our <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> destructor contains a <strong class="source-inline">cout</strong> statement so that we can visualize that there are only two <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> objects destructed. Here, the destructed <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> objects represent the instance taken over by <strong class="source-inline">pers2</strong> (from <strong class="source-inline">pers1</strong>) via the <strong class="source-inline">move()</strong> statement, and the <strong class="source-inline">pers3</strong> object that was created using the <strong class="source-inline">make_unique</strong> wrapper.</p>
<p>Next, let’s add examples using shared and weak smart po<a id="_idTextAnchor931"/>inters.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-318"><a id="_idTextAnchor932"/>Using smart pointers – shared</h2>
<p>A <strong class="bold">shared pointer</strong>, specified as <strong class="source-inline">shared_ptr</strong> in the<a id="_idIndexMarker1333"/> Standard C++ Library, is<a id="_idIndexMarker1334"/> a type of smart pointer that permits shared ownership of and access to a given resource. The last shared pointer to the resource in question will trigger the destruction and memory deallocation of the resource. Shared pointers can be used in multithreaded applications; however, race conditions may occur if non-constant member functions are used to modify the shared resource. Since shared pointers only provide reference counting, we will need to enlist additional library methods to solve these issues (alleviating race conditions, synchronizing access to critical regions of code, and so on). The Standard C++ Library, for example, provides overloaded atomic methods to lock, store, and compare the underlying data pointed to by a shared pointer.</p>
<p>We have seen many example<a id="_idIndexMarker1335"/> programs that could take advantage of shared pointers. For example, we utilized associations between the <strong class="source-inline">Course</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Student</strong> classes – a given student is associated with many courses and a given course is associated with many students. Clearly, multiple <strong class="source-inline">Student</strong> instances may point to the same <strong class="source-inline">Course</strong> instance, and vice versa. </p>
<p>Previously, with raw pointers, it was the programmer’s responsibility to employ reference counting. In contrast, using shared pointers, the internal reference counter is atomically incremented and decremented in support of both pointer and thread safety. </p>
<p>Dereferencing a shared pointer is nearly as fast as dereferencing a raw pointer; however, because a shared pointer represents a wrapped pointer in a class, constructing and copying a shared pointer is more expensive. However, we are interested in making C++ safer, so we will simply note this very minor performance expense and move forward.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a very simple example using <strong class="source-inline">shared_ptr</strong>. This example can be found in our GitHub repository:</p>

    // alternative to preferred, previous line of code:

<strong class="bold">    shared_ptr&lt;int&gt; p2;</strong>// currently uninitialized (caution)
    p2 = p1; // p2 now shares the same memory as p1
    cout &lt;&lt; *p1 &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; *p2 &lt;&lt; endl;
    <strong class="bold">shared_ptr&lt;Person&gt; pers1 = std::make_shared&lt;Person&gt;</strong>

    pers2-&gt;Print();   
    cout &lt;&lt; "Number of references: " &lt;&lt; <strong class="bold">pers1.use_count()</strong>;
    return 0;
}</pre>
<p>In the aforementioned program, we create<a id="_idIndexMarker1336"/> four shared pointers – two to point<a id="_idIndexMarker1337"/> to the same integer (<strong class="source-inline">p1</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">p2</strong>) and two to point to the same instance of <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> (<strong class="source-inline">pers1</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">pers2</strong>). Each of these variables may change the specific shared memory they point to because we are using shared pointers (which allow such a reassignment). A change to the shared memory through <strong class="source-inline">pers1</strong>, for example, will be reflected should we then review the (shared) memory through pointer <strong class="source-inline">pers2</strong>; both variables point to the same memory location.</p>
<p>The heap memory will again be managed for us automatically as a benefit of using smart pointers. In this example, the memory will be destructed and deleted when the last reference to the memory is removed. Notice that reference counting is done on our behalf and that we can access this information using <strong class="source-inline">use_count()</strong>.</p>
<p>Let us notice something interesting about the previous example. Notice the mixed use of <strong class="source-inline">-&gt;</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">.</strong> notation with shared pointer variables <strong class="source-inline">pers1</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">pers2</strong>. For example, we utilize <strong class="source-inline">pers1-&gt;Print();</strong> and yet we also utilize <strong class="source-inline">pers1.use_count()</strong>. This is no mistake and reveals the wrapper implementation of the smart pointer. With that in mind, we know that <strong class="source-inline">use_count()</strong> is a method of <strong class="source-inline">shared_ptr</strong>. Our shared pointers <strong class="source-inline">pers1</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">pers2</strong> are each declared as instances of <strong class="source-inline">shared_ptr</strong> (definitely not using raw C++ pointers with the symbol <strong class="source-inline">*</strong>). Hence, dot notation is appropriate to access method <strong class="source-inline">use_count()</strong>. Yet, we are using <strong class="source-inline">-&gt;</strong> notation to access <strong class="source-inline">pers1-&gt;Print();</strong>. Here, recall that this notation is equivalent to <strong class="source-inline">(*pers1).Print();</strong>. Both <strong class="source-inline">operator*</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">operator-&gt;</strong> in the <strong class="source-inline">shared_ptr</strong> class are overloaded to delegate to the wrapped, raw pointer contained within the smart pointer. Hence, we may utilize standard pointer notation to access <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> methods (through the safely wrapped raw pointer).</p>
<p>Here is the output for our <strong class="source-inline">shared_ptr</strong> pointer example:</p>
<p class="source-code">100 100</p>
<p class="source-code">Miss Gabby Doone</p>
<p class="source-code">Miss Gabby Doone</p>
<p class="source-code">Dr. Gabby Doone</p>
<p class="source-code">Number of references: 2</p>
<p class="source-code">Person destructor</p>
<p>Shared pointers<a id="_idIndexMarker1338"/> seem like a wonderful way to ensure that memory resources<a id="_idIndexMarker1339"/> pointed to by multiple pointers are properly managed. Overall, this is true. However, there are situations with circular dependencies such that shared pointers simply cannot release their memory – another pointer is always pointing to the memory in question. This happens when a cycle of memory is orphaned; that is, when no outside shared pointers point <em class="italic">into</em> the circular connection. In such unique cases, we might actually (and counterintuitively) mismanage memory with shared pointers. In these situations, we can elicit help from a weak pointer to help us break the cycle. </p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s next take a look at weak s<a id="_idTextAnchor935"/>mart pointers.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-319"><a id="_idTextAnchor936"/>Using smart pointers – weak</h2>
<p>A <strong class="bold">weak pointer</strong>, specified by <strong class="source-inline">weak_ptr</strong> in the Standard<a id="_idIndexMarker1340"/> C++ Library, is a type of smart pointer<a id="_idIndexMarker1341"/> that does not take ownership of a given resource; instead, the weak pointer acts as an observer. Weak pointers can be used to help break a circular connection that may exist between shared pointers; that is, situations where the destruction of a shared resource would otherwise never occur. Here, a weak pointer is inserted into the chain to break the circular dependency that shared pointers alone might otherwise create. </p>
<p>As an example, imagine<a id="_idIndexMarker1342"/> our <strong class="source-inline">Student</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Course</strong> dependencies from our initial programming examples utilizing association, or from our more complex program illustrating the Observer pattern. Each contains pointer data members of the associated object types, effectively creating a potential circular dependency. Now, should an outside (from the circle) shared pointer exist, such as an external list of courses or an external list of students, the exclusive circular dependency scenario may not arise. In this case, for example, the master list of courses (the external pointer, separate from any circular dependency existing between the associated objects) will provide the means to cancel a course, leading to its eventual destruction.</p>
<p>Likewise in our example, an external set of students comprising the university’s student body can provide an external pointer to the potentially circular shared pointer scenario resulting from the association between <strong class="source-inline">Student</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Course</strong>. Yet in both of these cases, work will need to be done to remove a canceled course from a student’s course list (or remove a dropped student from a course’s student list). The removal of the associations in this scenario reflects accurately managing a student’s schedule or a course’s attendance list. Nonetheless, we can imagine scenarios where a circular connection may exist without an outside handle to the links (unlike the aforementioned scenario, which has outside links into the circle).</p>
<p>In the case where a circular<a id="_idIndexMarker1343"/> dependency exists (with no outside influences), we will need<a id="_idIndexMarker1344"/> to downgrade one of the shared pointers to a weak pointer. A weak pointer will not control the lifetime of the resource that it points to.</p>
<p>A weak pointer to a resource cannot access the resource directly. This is because operators <strong class="source-inline">*</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">-&gt;</strong> are not overloaded in the <strong class="source-inline">weak_ptr</strong> class. You will need to convert the weak pointer to a shared pointer in order to access methods of the (wrapped) pointer type. One way to do this is to apply the <strong class="source-inline">lock()</strong> method to a weak pointer, as the return value is a shared pointer whose contents are locked with a semaphore to ensure mutual exclusivity to t<a id="_idTextAnchor937"/>he shared resource.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a very simple example using <strong class="source-inline">weak_ptr</strong>. This example can be found on our GitHub:</p>

<p>In the aforementioned<a id="_idIndexMarker1345"/> program, we allocate our resource using a shared<a id="_idIndexMarker1346"/> pointer in <strong class="source-inline">pers1</strong>. Now, let us imagine we had a reason in our program to downgrade our resource to a weak pointer – perhaps we would like to insert a weak pointer to break an otherwise cycle of shared pointers. Using <strong class="source-inline">weak_ptr&lt;Person&gt; wpers1(pers1);</strong>, we establish a weak pointer to this resource. Notice that we cannot use <strong class="source-inline">wpers1</strong> to call <strong class="source-inline">Print();</strong>. This is because <strong class="source-inline">operator-&gt;</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">operator*</strong> have not been overloaded in the <strong class="source-inline">weak_ptr</strong> class. </p>
<p>We print out <strong class="source-inline">use_count()</strong> for each of <strong class="source-inline">pers1</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">wpers1</strong> to notice that each shows a value of <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>. That is, there is only one non-weak pointer controlling the resource in question (the weak pointer may temporarily hold the resource, but cannot modify it). </p>
<p>Now, imagine that we would like to convert the resource pointed to by <strong class="source-inline">wpers1</strong> on-demand to another shared pointer, so that we may access the resource. We can do so by first gaining a lock on the weak pointer; <strong class="source-inline">lock()</strong> will return a shared pointer whose contents are protected by a semaphore. We assign this value to <strong class="source-inline">pers2</strong>. We then call <strong class="source-inline">pers2-&gt;ModifyTitle("Dr.");</strong> on the resource using the shared pointer.  </p>
<p>Finally, we print out <strong class="source-inline">use_count()</strong> from the perspective of each of <strong class="source-inline">pers1</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">wpers1</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">pers2</strong>. In each case, the reference count will be <strong class="source-inline">2</strong>, as there are two non-weak pointers referencing the shared resource. The weak pointer does not contribute to the reference count of that resource, which is exactly how weak pointers can help break a chain of circular dependencies. By inserting a weak pointer into the dependency loop, the reference count to the shared resource will not be affected by the weak pointer’s presence. This strategy allows the resource to be deleted when only the weak pointer to the resource remains (and the reference count is <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>). </p>
<p>The heap memory will again be managed for us automatically as a benefit of using smart pointers. In this example, the memory will be destructed and deleted when the last reference to the memory is removed. Again, note that the weak pointer did not contribute a reference to this count. We can see from the <strong class="source-inline">cout</strong> statement in the <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> destructor that only one ins<a id="_idTextAnchor939"/>tance was destructed.</p>
<p>Here is the output for our <strong class="source-inline">weak_ptr</strong> pointer example:</p>

<p>In this section, we’ve reviewed<a id="_idIndexMarker1347"/> and added to the basics regarding smart pointers. However, there<a id="_idIndexMarker1348"/> could be a chapter easily spent on each type of smart pointer. Nonetheless, hopefully, you have enough comfort with the essentials to begin to include a variety of smart pointers in your code and investigate each type further as your need arises. </p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-320"><a id="_idTextAnchor940"/>Exploring a complementary idea – RAII</h2>
<p>A programming idiom<a id="_idIndexMarker1349"/> that complements smart pointers (as well as other concepts) is <strong class="bold">RAII</strong> (<strong class="bold">Resource Acquisition Is Initialization</strong>). RAII binds the life cycle of a (potentially shared) resource to the lifetime of an object by requiring the resource to be acquired before use. This concept can help control the life cycle of a shared resource. RAII can be applied to concepts we have previously seen, such as allocated heap memory (through the usage of smart pointers), or to the concept of reference counting that we covered in <a href="B19087_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor454"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing Association, Aggregation, and Composition</em>. This programming technique is also applicable to multithreaded programming (accessing shared resources with a mutex lock), as well as to coordinate access to other shared resources such as sockets, files, or databases. Ownership of a resource can be transferred from one object to another safely using a <strong class="source-inline">move()</strong> operation.</p>
<p>Many C++ class libraries follow RAII for resource management, such as <strong class="source-inline">std::string</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">std::vector</strong>. These classes follow the idiom in that their constructors acquire the necessary resources (heap memory), and release the resources automatically in their destructors. The user of these classes is not required to explicitly release any memory for the container itself. In these class libraries, RAII as a technique is used to manage these resources, even though the heap memory is not managed using smart pointers. Instead, the concepts of RAII are encapsulated and hidden within the class implementations themselves.</p>
<p>When we implemented<a id="_idIndexMarker1350"/> our own smart pointers in <a href="B19087_20.xhtml#_idTextAnchor876"><em class="italic">Chapter 20</em></a>, <em class="italic">Removing Implementation Details Using the pImpl Pattern</em>, we used RAII, without knowing it, to ensure the allocation of the heap resource within our constructor and the release of the resource in our destructor. The smart pointers implemented in the Standard C++ Library (<strong class="source-inline">std::unique_ptr</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">std::shared_ptr</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">std::weak_ptr</strong>) embrace this idiom as well. Embracing RAII by using classes employing this idiom (or by adding it yourself to classes when this is not possible), can help ensure code is safer and easier to maintain. Because of the safety and robustness that this idiom adds to code, savvy developers urge us to embrace RAII as one of the most important practices and features available in C++.</p>
<p>Next in our effort to make C++ safer, let’s consider several easy C++ features we can easily embrace to ensure our coding is more robust.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-321">Embracing additional C++ <a id="_idTextAnchor941"/>features promoting safety</h1>
<p>As we have seen through 20 previous<a id="_idIndexMarker1351"/> chapters of programming, C++ is an extensive language. We know that C++ has great power and that we can do nearly anything in C++. As object-oriented C++ programmers, we have seen how to adopt OO designs, with the goal of making our code more easily maintainable.</p>
<p>We have also gained a lot of experience utilizing raw (native) pointers in C++, primarily because raw pointers are very pervasive in existing code. You truly need experience and facility in using native pointers for when the need arises. In gaining this experience, we have seen firsthand the pitfalls we may encounter with mismanagement of heap memory – our programs may have crashed, we may have leaked memory, overwritten memory accidentally, left dangling pointers, and so on. Our first order of business in this chapter was to prefer using smart pointers in newly created code – to promote safety in C++. </p>
<p>Now, we will explore<a id="_idIndexMarker1352"/> other areas of C++ that we can similarly employ safer features. We have seen these various features throughout the book; it is important to establish a guideline that select language features promote safety in C++. Just because we can do anything in C++ doesn’t mean that we should routinely include features in our repertoire that have a high level of misuse associated with them. Applications that continually crash (or crash even once) are unacceptable. Certainly, we have noted no-nos throughout the book. Here, let’s point out language features that are worth embracing to further our goal of making C++ safer, leaving our applications more robust and more easily maintainable.</p>
<p>Let’s start by reviewing simple items we can incorporate into our everyday code.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-322"><a id="_idTextAnchor942"/>Revisiting range for loops</h2>
<p>C++ has a variety of looping constructs<a id="_idIndexMarker1353"/> that we have seen throughout the book. One common error that occurs when processing a complete set of items is correctly keeping track of how many items are in the set, especially when this counter is used as a basis to loop through all items in the set. Processing too many elements when our set is stored as an array, for example, could lead our code to raise an exception unnecessarily (or worse, could lead our program to crash). </p>
<p>Rather than relying on a <strong class="source-inline">MAX</strong> value to conduct our looping for all elements in a set, it is more desirable to loop through every item in the set in a way that doesn’t count on the programmer correctly remembering this upper loop value. Instead, for each item in the set, let’s do some sort of processing. A for-each loop answers this need quite nicely.</p>
<p>One common error that occurs when processing a non-complete set of items is correctly keeping track of how many items are currently in the set. For example, a <strong class="source-inline">Course</strong> may have a maximum number of students permitted. Yet, as of today, only half of the potential <strong class="source-inline">Student</strong> slots are filled. When we peruse the list of students enrolled in the course, we need to ensure we are processing only the filled student spots (that is, the current number of students). Processing all maximum student spots would clearly be an error and could lead our program to crash. In this scenario, we must use care to iterate only over the currently utilized <strong class="source-inline">Student</strong> spots in the <strong class="source-inline">Course</strong>, either through using logic to exit a loop when appropriate or by selecting a container type whose current size represents the complete size of the set to be iterated upon (with no empty <em class="italic">to be filled</em> spots); the latter scenario making a for-each loop an ideal choice. </p>
<p>Also, what if we rely on looping<a id="_idIndexMarker1354"/> based upon a <strong class="source-inline">currentNumStudents</strong> counter? This may be better than a <strong class="source-inline">MAX</strong> value in cases as previously illustrated, but what if we’ve not kept that counter correctly updated? We’re subject to an error on this as well. Again, combining a container class where the number of entries represents the current number of entries with a for-each type of loop can ensure that we process the complete, current grouping in a less error-prone manner.</p>
<p>Now that we have revisited modern and more safe looping styles, let’s embrace <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> to ensure type safety. We will then see an example incorporating these collective feature<a id="_idTextAnchor943"/>s.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-323"><a id="_idTextAnchor944"/>Using auto for type safety</h2>
<p>Many situations arise<a id="_idIndexMarker1355"/> in which using <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> makes coding easier with respect<a id="_idIndexMarker1356"/> to variable declarations, including loop iterators. Additionally, using <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> instead of explicit typing can ensure type safety. </p>
<p>Choosing to use <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> is a simple way to declare a variable that has a complicated type. Using <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> can also ensure that the best type is chosen for a given variable and that implicit conversion will not occur. </p>
<p>We can use <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> as a placeholder for types in a variety of situations, allowing the compiler to deduce what is needed in a particular situation. We can even use <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> as a return type for a function in many cases. Using <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> allows our code to appear more generic and can complement templates as an alternative to genericizing a type. We can pair <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> with <strong class="source-inline">const</strong>, and also pair these qualifiers with references; note that these qualifiers <em class="italic">combined</em> cannot be extrapolated with <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> and must be specified individually by the programmer. Additionally, <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> cannot also be used with qualifiers augmenting a type, such as <strong class="source-inline">long</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">short</strong>, nor can it be used with <strong class="source-inline">volatile</strong>. Though outside the scope of our book, <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> can be utilized with lambda expressions. </p>
<p>Of course, using <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> has a few drawbacks. For example, if the programmer doesn’t understand the type of object being created, the programmer may anticipate the compiler to select a certain type, and yet another (unexpected) type is deduced. This may create subtle errors in your code. For example, if you have overloaded functions for both the type you think <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> will select and for the type the compiler actually deduces the <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> declaration to be, you may call a different function than anticipated! Certainly, this may mostly be due to the programmer not fully understanding the context of usage at hand when inserting the <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> keyword. Another drawback is when the programmer uses <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> just to force the code to compile, without truly working through the syntax at hand and thinking about how the code should be written. </p>
<p>Now that we have<a id="_idIndexMarker1357"/> revisited adding <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> to our code, let’s revisit embracing<a id="_idIndexMarker1358"/> STL in our everyday code. We will then see an example incorporating these collective features.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-324"><a id="_idTextAnchor945"/>Preferring STL for simple containers</h2>
<p>The Standard Template<a id="_idIndexMarker1359"/> Library, as we’ve seen<a id="_idIndexMarker1360"/> in <a href="B19087_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor595"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>, <em class="italic">Understanding STL Basics</em>, includes a very complete and robust set of container classes th<a id="_idTextAnchor946"/>at are widely utilized in C++ code. Using these well-tested components instead of native C++ mechanisms (such as an array of pointers) to collect like items can add robustness and reliability to our code. The memory management is eased on our behalf (eliminating many potential errors). </p>
<p>The STL, by using templates to implement its large variety of container classes, allows its containers to be used generically for any data type our programs may encounter. By comparison, had we utilized native C++ mechanisms, it is likely that we may have tied our implementation to a specific class type, such as an array of pointers to <strong class="source-inline">Student</strong>. Certainly, we could have implemented an array of pointers to a templatized type, but why do so when such a nice variety of well-tested containers are readily available for our use?</p>
<p>STL containers also avoid using <strong class="source-inline">new()</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">delete()</strong> for memory management, choosing to use allocators to improve efficiency for STL’s underlying memory management. For example, a vector, stack, or queue may grow and shrink in size. Rather than allocating the maximum number of elements you may anticipate (which may be both difficult to estimate or inefficient to over-allocate for typical usage that does not reach the maximum), a certain buffer size or a number of elements may be allocated under the hood up front. This initial allocation allows multiple additions to the container without a resize necessary for each new addition to the set (as might otherwise be done to avoid over-allocation). Only when the underlying container’s internal allocation (or buffer) size exceeds the pre-allocated amount will an internal reallocation be necessary (unknown to the user of the container). The expense of an internal reallocation, or a <em class="italic">move</em>, is the allocation of a larger piece of memory, copying from the original memory to the larger piece, and then the release of the original memory. The STL works to fine-tune, under the hood, the internal allocations to balance typical usage needs versus costly reallocation that might otherwise be performed. </p>
<p>Now that we have revisited<a id="_idIndexMarker1361"/> preferring STL in our code, let’s revisit<a id="_idIndexMarker1362"/> applying <strong class="source-inline">const</strong> when necessary to ensure code isn’t modified unless we so intend it to be. We will wrap up this section with an example illustrating all of the key sa<a id="_idTextAnchor947"/><a id="_idTextAnchor948"/>fety points featured in this section.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-325"><a id="_idTextAnchor949"/>Applying const as needed</h2>
<p>Applying the <strong class="source-inline">const</strong> qualifier to objects<a id="_idIndexMarker1363"/> is an easy way to indicate that instances<a id="_idIndexMarker1364"/> that should not be modified are not, in fact, modified. We may recall that <strong class="source-inline">const</strong> instances may only call <strong class="source-inline">const</strong> member functions. And that <strong class="source-inline">const</strong> member functions may not modify any part of the object calling the method (<strong class="source-inline">this</strong>). Remembering to utilize this simple qualifier can ensure that this chain of checkpoints occurs for objects that we truly do not intend to modify.</p>
<p>With that in mind, remember that <strong class="source-inline">const</strong> can be utilized in parameter lists, to qualify objects and methods. Using <strong class="source-inline">const</strong> adds readability to the objects and methods it qualifies as well as adding the valuable enforcement of read-only objects and methods. Let’s remember to use <strong class="source-inline">const</strong> as needed! </p>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at how we can use each of these easily added C++ features that contribute to safer programming. This example revisits preferred looping styles, using <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> for type safety, using the STL for simple contain<a id="_idTextAnchor950"/>ers, and applying <strong class="source-inline">const</strong> as appropriate. This example can be found in our GitHub repository:</p>

        student.Print();
    return 0;
}</pre>
<p>In the aforementioned program, we initially notice<a id="_idIndexMarker1365"/> that we have included<a id="_idIndexMarker1366"/> the use of <strong class="source-inline">std::vector</strong> from C++’s STL. Further in <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong>, we notice the instantiation of a vector using <strong class="source-inline">vector&lt;Student&gt; studentBody;</strong>. Utilizing this well-tested container class certainly adds robustness to our code versus managing a dynamically sized array ourselves. </p>
<p>Next, notice the specification of a constant member function <strong class="source-inline">void Student::Print() const;</strong>. Here, the <strong class="source-inline">const</strong> qualification ensures that no part of the object invoking this method (<strong class="source-inline">this</strong>) will be able to be modified. Furthermore, should any <strong class="source-inline">const</strong> instances exist, they will be able to invoke <strong class="source-inline">Student::Print()</strong> as the <strong class="source-inline">const</strong> qualification guarantees this method to be safe (that is, read-only) for <strong class="source-inline">const</strong> instances to utilize. </p>
<p>Next, we notice three looping styles and mechanisms, progressing from least to most safe in style. The first loop cycles through each element in the loop with a traditional style <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop. What if we had used <strong class="source-inline">MAX</strong> for the looping condition instead of <strong class="source-inline">studentBody.size()</strong>? We might have tried to process more elements than are currently in the container; this type of oversight can be error-prone. </p>
<p>The second loop utilizes an iterator and the <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> keyword to make the type specification easier (and hence safer) for the iterator itself. Iterators, though well defined, are still not the preferred looping mechanism. A subtlety from the increment in the second statement in the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> statement can also lead to inefficiency. Consider, for example, the pre versus post increment in the statement that is executed before the loop condition is retested (that is, <strong class="source-inline">++iter</strong>). Had this been <strong class="source-inline">iter++</strong>, the code would be less efficient. This is because <strong class="source-inline">iter</strong> is an object and the pre-increment returns a reference to the object, whereas the post-increment returns a temporary object (what is created and destroyed with each loop iteration). The post-increment also utilizes an overloaded function, so the compiler cannot optimize its usage. </p>
<p>Finally, we see the preferred and safest looping mechanism, featuring a range-for loop combined with <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> for the iterator specification (to simplify the type declaration). The use of <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> replaces <strong class="source-inline">vector&lt;Student&gt;::iterator</strong> as the type for <strong class="source-inline">iter</strong>. Any time there is an ease in notation, there is also less room for error. Also, notice the use of <strong class="source-inline">const</strong> added to the iterator declaration to ensure that the loop will only call non-modifiable methods on each instance iterated upon; this is an example of an additional, appropriate safety feature we can employ in our code. </p>
<p>Here is the output for our aforementioned program:</p>
<p class="source-code">Miss Hana U. Sato with id: 178PSU GPA:  3.8 Course: C++</p>
<p class="source-code">Mr. Sam B. Kato with id: 272PSU GPA:  3.5 Course: C++</p>

<p class="source-code">Dr. Giselle R. LeBrun with id: 299TU GPA:  3.4 Course: C++</p>
<p>We have now revisited several <a id="_idIndexMarker1367"/>straightforward C++ language features that can easily <a id="_idIndexMarker1368"/>be embraced to promote safety in our everyday coding practices. Using range-for loops provides code simplification and removes dependencies from often incorrect upper limits of loop iteration. Embracing <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> simplifies variable declarations, including within loop iterators, and can help ensure type safety versus explicit typing. Using well-tested STL components can add robustness, reliability, and familiarity to our code. Finally, applying <strong class="source-inline">const</strong> to data and methods is an easy way to ensure data is not modified unintentionally. Each of these principles is easy to employ and adds value to our code by adding to its overall safety.</p>
<p>Next, let’s consider how understanding thread safety can contribute to <a id="_idTextAnchor954"/>making C++ safer.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-326"><a id="_idTextAnchor955"/>Considering thread safety</h1>
<p>Multithreaded programming<a id="_idIndexMarker1369"/> in C++ is an entire book unto itself. Nonetheless, we have mentioned several situations throughout the book that potentially require the consideration of thread safety. It is worth re-iterating these topics to provide an overview of the issues you may encounter in various niches of C++ programming. </p>
<p>A program may be comprised<a id="_idIndexMarker1370"/> of multiple threads, each of which may potentially compete against one another to access a shared resource. For example, a shared resource could be a file, socket, region of shared memory, or output buffer. Each thread accessing<a id="_idIndexMarker1371"/> the shared resource needs to have carefully coordinated (known as mutually exclusive) access to the resource. </p>
<p>Imagine, for example, if two threads wanted to write output to your screen. If each thread could access the output buffer associated with <strong class="source-inline">cout</strong> without waiting for the other to complete a cohesive statement, the output would be a garbled mess of random letters and symbols. Clearly, synchronized access to a shared resource is important!</p>
<p>Thread safety involves understanding atomic actions, mutual exclusion, locks, synchronization, and so on—all of which are aspects of multithreaded programming. </p>
<p>Let’s begin with an over<a id="_idTextAnchor956"/>view of threads and multithreaded programming.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-327"><a id="_idTextAnchor957"/>Multithreaded programming overview</h2>
<p>A <strong class="bold">thread</strong> is a separate flow of control within<a id="_idIndexMarker1372"/> a process, conceptually working<a id="_idIndexMarker1373"/> like a subprocess (or further subdivision of a process) within a given<a id="_idIndexMarker1374"/> process. Threads are sometimes referred to as <em class="italic">threads of control</em>. Applications that have many threads<a id="_idIndexMarker1375"/> of control are known as <strong class="bold">multithreaded applications</strong>. </p>
<p>In uniprocessor environments, threads give the appearance that multiple tasks are running concurrently. Just as with processes, threads are swapped in and out of the CPU quickly to appear to the user that they are being processed simultaneously (though they aren’t). In a shared, multiprocessor environment, the use of threads within an application can significantly speed up processing and allow parallel computing to be realized. Even in a uniprocessor system, threads can actually (and perhaps counterintuitively) speed up a process, in that one thread may run while waiting for the I/O of another thread to complete. </p>
<p>Threads related by the tasks they are performing may find themselves in similar methods of a class simultaneously. If each thread is working on a distinct dataset (such as a distinct <strong class="source-inline">this</strong> pointer, even if working within the same method), there is generally no need to synchronize access to those methods. For example, imagine <strong class="source-inline">s1.EarnPhd();</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">s2.EarnPhD();</strong>. Here, two separate instances are in the same method (possibly concurrently). However, the datasets worked upon in each method differ – in the first scenario, <strong class="source-inline">s1</strong> will bind to <strong class="source-inline">this</strong>; in the second scenario, <strong class="source-inline">s2</strong> will bind to <strong class="source-inline">this</strong>. There is most likely no overlap in shared data between the two instances. However, if these methods are accessing static data (that is shared by all instances of a given class, such as a <strong class="source-inline">numStudents</strong> data member), synchronization to the critical pieces of code accessing the shared memory regions will be required. Traditionally, system-dependent locks or semaphores are added around data or functions that require mutual exclusivity to critical regions of code.</p>
<p>Multithreaded programming<a id="_idIndexMarker1376"/> in C++ is available through a variety of commercial or public domain multithreading libraries. Additionally, the Standard C++ Library features thread support in a variety of capacities including using <strong class="source-inline">std::condition_variable</strong> for thread synchronization, <strong class="source-inline">std::mutex</strong> to ensure mutual exclusivity of critical resources (by avoiding race conditions), and <strong class="source-inline">std::semaphore</strong> to model resource counting. By instantiating a <strong class="source-inline">std::thread</strong> object and becoming proficient with the aforementioned features, we can add multithreaded programming using an established C++ library. Additionally, the <strong class="source-inline">std::atomic</strong> template can be added to a type to establish it as an atomic type and ensure type-safe synchronization. The <strong class="source-inline">std::exception_ptr</strong> type allows the transport of exceptions between coordinating threads. Overall, there are many thread library features to consider; this is a vast topic.</p>
<p>The details for multithreaded programming are beyond the scope of this book; however, we can discuss scenarios within this book that may be augmented to require the knowledge of using threads. Let’s revisit some of those situations.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-328"><a id="_idTextAnchor958"/>Multithreaded programming scenarios</h2>
<p>There are many programming<a id="_idIndexMarker1377"/> scenarios that can benefit from the use of multithreaded programming. We will just mention a few that extend the ideas we have covered in this book.</p>
<p>The Observer pattern may certainly be employed in multithreaded programming scenarios! In these instances, care must be used in the <strong class="source-inline">Update()</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Notify()</strong> methods of <strong class="source-inline">Observer</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Subject</strong>, respectively, to add synchronization and locking mechanisms. </p>
<p>Smart pointers, such as <strong class="source-inline">shared_ptr</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">weak_ptr</strong>, can be used in multithreaded applications<a id="_idIndexMarker1378"/> and already include the means to lock and synchronize access to shared resources via reference counting (and with the use of atomic library methods).</p>
<p>Objects related through association may arise with multithreaded programming or through shared memory regions. Any time access is conducted through a shared resource using multithreaded programming, mutexes (locks) should be employed to ensure mutual exclusivity to those shared resources.</p>
<p>Objects throwing exceptions that need to communicate with one another will need to include synchronization within catcher blocks or delegate exceptions to the <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> program thread. Employing worker threads to communicate with the <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> program thread is a typical design model. Utilizing shared memory is a means to store the data that will need to be shared between threads coordinating with a <strong class="source-inline">throw</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">catch</strong> of the exception itself. An instance of <strong class="source-inline">std::exception_ptr</strong> can be utilized with <strong class="source-inline">std::current_exception()</strong> to store an instance needing to be shared. This shared instance (between threads) can be rethrown to a participating thread using <strong class="source-inline">std::rethrow_exception()</strong>. </p>
<p>Multithreaded programming is a fascinating topic unto itself and requires in-depth understanding to utilize safely in C++. We’ve revisited a few areas in which thread safety considerations may complement areas we have covered in this book. It is highly recommended to delve deeply into thread safety in C++ before embarking on adding multithreaded programming to your code. </p>
<p>Next, let’s move forward to investigate how programming guidelines can add a necessary level of safety to C++ programming. </p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-329"><a id="_idTextAnchor959"/>Utilizing core programming guidelines</h1>
<p>Programming guidelines<a id="_idIndexMarker1379"/> are much more than a set of conventions to indicate how many spaces to indent or naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, data members, and member functions. A modern programming guideline is a covenant between programmers within an organization to create code adhering to specific standards, with the largest goal to provide robust and easily extensible code by following these common standards. The bottom line is that most of the conventions contained within a programming guideline are simply to make programming in C++ safer. </p>
<p>The consensus<a id="_idIndexMarker1380"/> of what comprises a C++ programming guideline may vary from organization to organization, but there are many resources available (including from standards committees) to provide examples and direction.</p>
<p>Let’s move forward to examine a sampling of programming guide essentials and then discuss adopting a core set of guidelines, as well as understanding resources widely available for programming safely in C++.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-330"><a id="_idTextAnchor960"/>Examining guideline essentials</h2>
<p>Let’s start by examining<a id="_idIndexMarker1381"/> a sampling of meaningful conventions<a id="_idIndexMarker1382"/> to follow from a typical C++ programming guideline. We have examined many of these programming issues throughout the book, yet it is useful to review a few items to provide a starting point for choosing conventions to promote C++ safety.</p>
<h3>Preferring initialization over assignment</h3>
<p>Always choose initialization, whenever<a id="_idIndexMarker1383"/> possible, over assignment. It’s simply more efficient and safer! Use in-class initialization or the member initialization list. When assignment is used after initialization, it can be less efficient. Imagine, for example, a member object that is default constructed, only to quickly overwrite its values with more suitable values via assignment in the body of the constructor. It would have been more efficient to utilize the member initialization list to initialize this member object via an alternate constructor. </p>
<p>Also, neglecting to give each piece of memory an initial value can cost us dearly in terms of safety – memory in C++ is not clean, so it is truly inappropriate to interpret whatever is in an uninitialized variable (or data member) as valid. Accessing an uninitialized value is an undefined behavior. We truly never know what is lurking in uninitialized memory, but we know it is never the correct value to be used as an initializer!</p>
<p>Let’s review preferred initialization with a small program. This example can be found in our GitHub:</p>
<p class="SC---Link" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Deciphering-Object-Oriented-Programming-with-CPP/blob/main/Chapter21/Chp21-Ex5.cpp">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Deciphering-Object-Oriented-Programming-with-CPP/blob/main/Chapter21/Chp21-Ex5.cpp</a></p>
<pre class="source-code">

   string firstName; <strong class="bold">// str mbrs are default constructed so</strong>
   string lastName;  <strong class="bold">// w<a id="_idTextAnchor961"/>e don't need in-class initializers</strong>
   <strong class="bold">char middleInitial = '\0';  // in-class initialization</strong>

   void ModifyTitle(const string &amp;); 
public:

   Person(const string &amp;, const string &amp;, char, 
          const string &amp;);  
   // use default copy constructor and default destructor
   // inline function definitions
   const string &amp;GetFirstName() const { return firstName; }
   const string &amp;GetLastName() const { return lastName; }
   const string &amp;GetTitle() const { return title; } 
   <a id="_idTextAnchor962"/>c<a id="_idTextAnchor963"/>har GetMiddleInitial() const { return middleInitial; }
};
// With in-class initialization, it often not necessary to
// write the default constructor yourself – there's often
// nothing remaining to initialize!
// alternate constructor
<strong class="bold">// Note use of member init list to initialize data members</strong>
Person::Person(const string &amp;fn, const string &amp;ln, char mi,
               const string &amp;t)<strong class="bold">: firstName(fn),</strong>
               <strong class="bold">lastName(ln), middleInitial(mi), title(t)</strong>
{
    // no need to assign values in body o<a id="_idTextAnchor964"/>f method –
    // initialization has handled everything!
}</pre>
<p>Examining the preceding<a id="_idIndexMarker1384"/> code, we notice that the <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> class uses in-class initialization to set the <strong class="source-inline">middleInitial</strong> data member to the null character (<strong class="source-inline">'\0'</strong>). For each instance of <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">middleInitial</strong> will be set to the null character prior to any constructor call that further initializes the instance in question. Notice that the other data members in the class are all of type <strong class="source-inline">string</strong>. Because <strong class="source-inline">string</strong> is a class itself, these data members are actually member objects of type <strong class="source-inline">string</strong> and will be default constructed, appropriately initializing each of these string members. </p>
<p>Next, notice that we opted not to provide a default (no argument) constructor, allowing the system-supplied default constructor to be linked in for us. In-class initialization, coupled with the appropriate member object initialization of the <strong class="source-inline">string</strong> members, left no additional initialization necessary for new <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> instances, and hence no need for a programmer-specified default constructor. </p>
<p>Finally, notice our use of the member initialization list in the alternate constructor for <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong>. Here, each data member is set with an appropriate value from the parameter list of this method. Notice that every data member is set via initialization, leaving no assignments necessary in the body of the alternate constructor. </p>
<p>Our preceding code follows the popular code guideline: whenever possible, always opt to set values via initialization versus assignment. Knowing that each data member has an appropriate value during construction leads us to provide a safer code. Initialization is also more efficient than assignment. </p>
<p>Now, let’s consider another core C++ guideline relating to virtual functions.</p>
<h3>Choosing one of virtual, override, or final</h3>
<p>Polymorphism is a wonderful concept<a id="_idIndexMarker1385"/> that C++ easily supports<a id="_idIndexMarker1386"/> with the use of virtual<a id="_idIndexMarker1387"/> functions. We learned in <a href="B19087_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor366"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Utilizing Dynamic Binding through Polymorphism</em>, that the keyword <strong class="source-inline">virtual</strong> is used to indicate a polymorphic operation – an operation that may be overridden by derived classes with a preferred method. Derived classes are not obligated to override a polymorphic operation (virtual function) by providing a new method, but may find it meaningful to do so. </p>
<p>When a derived class chooses to override a virtual function introduced by a base class with a new method, the overridden method may use both the keywords <strong class="source-inline">virtual</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">override</strong> in the signature of the method. However, it is a convention to use only <strong class="source-inline">override</strong> at this overridden (derived class) level. </p>
<p>When a virtual function is introduced in the hierarchy, it may be desirable at some point to indicate that a certain method is the <em class="italic">final</em> implementation of this operation. That is, the operation in question may no longer be overridden. We know that it is appropriate to apply the <strong class="source-inline">final</strong> specifier to the virtual function at this level of the hierarchy to indicate that a given method may no longer be overridden. Though we may also include the keyword <strong class="source-inline">virtual</strong> at this level as well, it is recommended to only utilize <strong class="source-inline">final</strong>. </p>
<p>To sum up, when specifying a virtual function, only choose one label at each level: <strong class="source-inline">virtual</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">override</strong>, or <strong class="source-inline">final</strong> – even though the keyword <strong class="source-inline">virtual</strong> can be added to complement <strong class="source-inline">override</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">final</strong>. By doing so, it will be much clearer if the virtual function at hand is newly introduced (<strong class="source-inline">virtual</strong>), an overridden method of a virtual function (<strong class="source-inline">override</strong>), or the final method of a virtual function (<strong class="source-inline">final</strong>). Clarity causes fewer errors to occur and that helps make C++ safer.</p>
<p>Let’s review the preferred keyword usage with virtual functions with a program segment. The complete example can be found in our GitHub repository:</p>
<p class="SC---Link" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Deciphering-Object-Oriented-Programming-with-CPP/blob/main/Chapter21/Chp21-Ex6.cpp">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Deciphering-Object-Oriented-Programming-with-CPP/blob/main/Chapter21/Chp21-Ex6.cpp</a></p>

<p>In the preceding<a id="_idIndexMarker1388"/> example, we see our <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> class<a id="_idIndexMarker1389"/> that we have carried<a id="_idIndexMarker1390"/> forward throughout the book. As a base class, notice that <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> specifies polymorphic operations of <strong class="source-inline">Print()</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">IsA()</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">Greeting()</strong>, as well as the destructor using the <strong class="source-inline">virtual</strong> keyword. These operations are intended to be overridden by a derived class with more suitable methods (not including the destructor), but are not required to be overridden should the derived class find the base class implementation suitable.</p>
<p>In the derived class, <strong class="source-inline">Student</strong>, we override <strong class="source-inline">IsA()</strong> with a more suitable method. Notice that we use <strong class="source-inline">override</strong> in the signature of this function, though we could have also included <strong class="source-inline">virtual</strong>. Next, notice that we have chosen not to override <strong class="source-inline">Greeting()</strong> at the <strong class="source-inline">Student</strong> level; we can assume that <strong class="source-inline">Student</strong> finds the implementation in <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> acceptable. Also notice that the destructor is overridden to provide the entry point to the destruction chain. Recall with a destructor that not only is the derived class destructor called, but the base class destructor will also be called (implicitly as the last line of code in the derived class destructor), allowing the object’s full destruction sequence to properly commence. </p>
<p>Finally, notice that <strong class="source-inline">Print()</strong> has been overridden as <strong class="source-inline">final</strong> in <strong class="source-inline">Student</strong>. Though we could have added <strong class="source-inline">override</strong> to the signature of this function as well, we choose to only utilize <strong class="source-inline">final</strong> per the recommended coding convention.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at another typical element in a typical C++ programming set of guidelines, relating to smart pointers.</p>
<h3>Preferring smart pointers in new code</h3>
<p>We have utilized<a id="_idIndexMarker1391"/> many native (raw) C++ pointers in this book, as you will undoubtedly be asked to immerse yourself in existing code in which they are plentiful. Having native pointer experience and facility will make you a safer programmer when asked to step into situations that use native pointers. </p>
<p>However, for safety’s sake, most programming guides will recommend using smart pointers exclusively in newly created code. After all, their use adds little overhead and can help eliminate many of the potential pitfalls of managing heap memory by the programmer. Smart pointers also aid in exception safety. For example, exception handling implies that the expected flow of code may be interrupted at nearly any time, leading to potential memory leaks with traditional pointer usage. Smart pointers can alleviate some of this burden and provide for exception safety. </p>
<p>Using smart pointers is so important in original code that this point is worth repeating: choosing smart pointers over native pointers leads to safer and far easier to maintain code in C++. The code will also be easier to write, eliminating the need for many destructors, automatically blocking undesired copies and assignment (<strong class="source-inline">unique_ptr</strong>), and so on. With that in mind, whenever possible, choose smart pointers in newly created code.</p>
<p>We’ve seen smart pointers in this book as well as native pointers. Now, you can choose to use smart pointers in the new code that you create – this is highly recommended. Certainly, there may be some scenarios when this is not possible; perhaps you are creating new code that interfaces heavily with existing native pointer code and need to utilize the same data structures. Nonetheless, you can strive to use smart pointers, when possible, yet you have the flexibility and experience to understand the vast amounts of existing code, libraries, and online examples that exist utilizing native pointers. </p>
<p>What could be better for safety than to have the facility of smart pointers for your original code, paired with the knowledge of native pointers to use only when necessary?</p>
<p>There are many examples of programming guidelines that can be easily followed to make your code safer. The aforementioned examples are just a few of many to illustrate the types of practices<a id="_idIndexMarker1392"/> you will expect to see in a set of essential C++ programming guidelines.</p>
<p>Now, let’s consider how we can assemble or adopt core programming guidelines to help make our code safer.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-331"><a id="_idTextAnchor965"/>Adopting a programming guideline</h2>
<p>Whether you build or assemble<a id="_idIndexMarker1393"/> a set of programming guidelines yourself or adhere to a set governed by an organization you are a member of, adopting a core set of C++ programming guidelines is crucial to ensure your code is as safe and robust as possible, translating to more easily maintainable code. </p>
<p>Guidelines should always remain fluid as the language evolves. Let’s next consider resources for finding core C++ programming guidelines to either follow directly or to revisit incrementally to improve the accepted guidelines within your organization. </p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-332"><a id="_idTextAnchor966"/>Understanding resources for programming safely in C++</h2>
<p>There are many online resources<a id="_idIndexMarker1394"/> for programming guidelines in C++. The essential resource, however, is the <em class="italic">ISO C++ Core Guidelines</em>, assembled primarily by Bjarne Stroustrup and Herb Sutter, which can be found at the following GitHub URL: <a href="https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md">https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md</a>. Their collective goal is to help programmers use modern C++ safely and more effectively. </p>
<p>Selected market sectors may have guidelines imposed upon them to obtain or ensure certification<a id="_idIndexMarker1395"/> within an industry. For example, <strong class="bold">MISRA</strong> is a set of C++ coding standards for the <strong class="bold">Motor Industry Software Reliability Association</strong>; MISRA has also been adopted as a standard across other industries, such as for medical systems. Another coding standard, developed<a id="_idIndexMarker1396"/> for embedded systems, is <strong class="bold">CERT</strong>, developed at <strong class="bold">Carnegie Mellon University</strong> (<strong class="bold">CMU</strong>). Once an acronym for <strong class="bold">Computer Emergency Response Team</strong>, CERT is now a registered trademark of CMU. CERT has been adopted in many financial sectors as well. <strong class="bold">JSF AV C++</strong> (<strong class="bold">Joint Strike Fighter Air Vehicle C++</strong>) is a C++ coding standard used<a id="_idIndexMarker1397"/> in the aerospace engineering domain, developed by Lockheed Martin, to ensure error-free code for safety-critical systems. </p>
<p>Undoubtedly, each organization you join as a contributor will have a base set of programming guidelines for all programmers in the group to follow. If not, a wise move will be to suggest employing a core set of C++ programming guidelines. After all, you will need to help maintain your own code<a id="_idIndexMarker1398"/> as well as the code of your colleagues; a uniform and expected set of st<a id="_idTextAnchor967"/><a id="_idTextAnchor968"/>andards will make this endeavor manageable for everyone involved.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-333"><a id="_idTextAnchor969"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this bonus chapter, we have added to our objective of becoming indispensable C++ programmers by understanding the importance of programming safely in C++. After all, our primary goal is to create robust and easily maintainable code. Incorporating safe programming practices will help us achieve this goal. </p>
<p>We have reviewed concepts seen throughout the book, as well as related ideas that culminate in adopting a set of core programming guidelines to ensure safer coding practices.</p>
<p>First, we reviewed smart pointers, examining three types from the Standard C++ Library, namely <strong class="source-inline">unique_ptr</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">shared_ptr</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">weak_ptr</strong>. We understand that these classes employ the RAII idiom by providing wrappers to allocate and deallocate heap memory safely on our behavior in well-tested standard library classes. We put forth a guideline: always prefer smart pointers in newly created code. </p>
<p>Next, we reiterated a variety of programming practices that we have seen throughout the book that we can employ to make our coding safer overall. For example, preferring for-each style loops and using <strong class="source-inline">auto</strong> for type safety. Also, using STL containers versus less robust native mechanisms, and also adding the <strong class="source-inline">const</strong> qualifier for data and methods to ensure read-only access when so needed. These practices are examples (among many) that can help ensure our code is as safe as possible. </p>
<p>Next, we introduced multithreaded programming in C++ and reviewed programming scenarios we have seen previously that may benefit from the use of threads. We also took a look ahead at the classes available in the Standard C++ Library in support of multithreaded programming, including those that provide synchronization, mutex locks, semaphores, and creating atomic types.</p>
<p>Finally, we examined programming guideline essentials to better understand rules that may be beneficial in a C++ core programming guide. For example, we reviewed preferring initialization over the assignment, virtual function usage with regard to the keywords <strong class="source-inline">virtual</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">override</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">final</strong>, as well as previously examined topics from this chapter. We talked about the importance of adopting a comprehensive set of core programming guidelines for C++ as well as resources to find sample guidelines used as industry standards.</p>
<p>Understanding how to make C++ safer as you apply the many features covered in the book will undoubtedly make you a more valuable programmer. You now have core language skills plus a very solid understanding of OOP in C++ (essential concepts and how to implement them in C++ with either direct language support or using programming techniques). We have augmented your skills with knowledge of exception handling, friends, operator overloading, templates, STL basics, and testing OO classes and components. We have also embraced core design patterns, delving into each pattern with comprehensive programming examples. Finally in this chapter, we have reviewed how to safely put together the knowledge you have learned by choosing to employ safer programming practices at each available opportunity.</p>
<p>As we wrap up our bonus chapter together, you are now ready to journey further on your own, applying C++ to many new and existing applications. You are ready to create safe, robust, and easy to maintain code. I am sincerely hopeful that you are as intrigued by C++ as I am. Once again, let’s get programming!</p>

<li value="1"><a id="_idTextAnchor974"/>The signature of a function is the function’s name plus its type and number of arguments (no return type).

For example, <strong class="source-inline">void Print(int, float);</strong> may have mangled name of <strong class="source-inline">Print_int_float();</strong>. This facilitates overloaded functions by giving each function a unique name so that when a call is made, it is evident by the internal function name as to which function is being invoked. </li>

Marking that copy additionally as <strong class="source-inline">const</strong> (meaning not allowing changing where the pointer points) would then be meaningless, as disallowing a <em class="italic">copy</em> of a pointer to be changed has no effect on the original pointer itself. The original pointer was never in jeopardy of its address being changed within the function.</li>
<li>There are many programming situations that might use a dynamically allocated 3-D array. For example, if an image is stored in a 2-D array, a collection of images might be stored in a 3-D array. Having a dynamically allocated 3-D array allows for any number of images to be read in from a filesystem and stored internally. Of course, you’d need to know how many images you’ll be reading in before making the 3-D array allocation. For example, a 3-D array might hold 30 images, where 30 is the third dimension to collect the images in a set. To conceptualize a 4-D array, perhaps you would like to organize sets of the aforementioned 3-D arrays. </li>
</ol>
<p>For example, perhaps you have a set of 31 images for the month of January. That set of January images is a 3-D array (2-D for the image and the third dimension for the set of 31 images comprising January). You may wish to do the same for every month. Rather than having separate 3-D array variables for each month’s image set, we can create a fourth dimension to collect the years’ worth of data into one set. The fourth dimension would have an element for each of the 12 months of the year. How about a 5-D array? You can extend this image idea by making the fifth dimension a way to collect various years of data, such as collecting images for a century (fifth dimension). Now we have images organized by century, then organized by year, then month, then by image (the image requiring the first two dimensions).</p>

<p>c. (follow-up question) Pointer variables need not only call the version of <strong class="source-inline">ReadData(Student *)</strong> that accepts a pointer to a <strong class="source-inline">Student</strong> and reference variables need not only call the version of <strong class="source-inline">ReadData(Student &amp;)</strong> that accepts a reference to a <strong class="source-inline">Student</strong>. For example, a pointer variable may be dereferenced with <strong class="source-inline">*</strong> and then call the version that accepts a reference. Likewise, a reference variable may have its address taken using <strong class="source-inline">&amp;</strong> and then call the version that accepts a pointer (though this is less commonly done). You simply need to make the data types match with respect to what you are passing and what the function expects. </p>

<li>Other examples which may easily incorporate the Observer pattern include any application requiring customers to receive notification of backordered products that they desire. For example, many people may wish to receive the Covid-19 vaccine and wish to be on a waiting list at a vaccine distribution site. Here, a <strong class="source-inline">VaccineDistributionSite</strong> (the subject of interest) can be inherited from <strong class="source-inline">Subject</strong> and contain a list of <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> objects, where <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> inherits from <strong class="source-inline">Observer</strong>. The <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> objects will contain a pointer to the <strong class="source-inline">VaccineDistributionSite</strong>. Once enough supply for the vaccine exists at a given <strong class="source-inline">VaccineDistributionSite</strong> (that is, a distribution event has occurred), <strong class="source-inline">Notify()</strong> can be called to update the <strong class="source-inline">Observer</strong> instances (people on the waitlist). Each <strong class="source-inline">Observer</strong> will be sent an <strong class="source-inline">Update()</strong>, which will be the means to allow that person to schedule an appointment. If the <strong class="source-inline">Update()</strong> returns success and the <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> has been scheduled for an appointment, the <strong class="source-inline">Observer</strong> can release itself from the waiting list with the <strong class="source-inline">Subject</strong>.</li>

A factory method can provide a way to instantiate the various types of <strong class="source-inline">Employee</strong> based on the information provided when the <strong class="source-inline">Employee</strong> is hired.

<li>We cannot label the <strong class="source-inline">static instance()</strong> method as virtual in <strong class="source-inline">Singleton</strong> and override it in <strong class="source-inline">President</strong>, simply because static methods can never be virtual. They are statically bound, and never receive a <strong class="source-inline">this</strong> pointer. Also, the signature may need to be different (and no one likes an un-intentional function hiding situation).</li>
<li><a id="_idTextAnchor1001"/>Other examples which may easily incorporate the Singleton pattern include creating a Singleton <strong class="source-inline">CEO</strong> of a company, a Singleton <strong class="source-inline">TreasuryDepartment</strong> for a country, or a Singleton <strong class="source-inline">Queen</strong> of a nation. Each of these Singleton instances offers the opportunity to establish a registry to keep track of multiple Singleton objects. That is, many countries may have a single <strong class="source-inline">Queen</strong>. In this case, the registry would allow not just one Singleton per object type, but one Singleton per other qualifiers, such as <em class="italic">nation</em>. This is an example of the rare case in which more than one Singleton object of a given type can occur (but always a controlled number of such objects).</li>

</ol>
<p>(follow-up question) In this chapter, simply inheriting <strong class="source-inline">Student</strong> from the <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> class that embraces the pImpl pattern presents no logistical difficulties. Additionally, modifying the <strong class="source-inline">Student</strong> class to also employ the pImpl pattern and utilize a unique pointer is more challenging. Various approaches may run across various difficulties, including dealing with inline functions, down-casting, avoiding explicit calls to the underlying implementation, or requiring back pointers to help invoke virtual functions. Please see the online solution for details.</p>
<ol>
<li value="3">Other examples which may easily incorporate the pImpl pattern for relative implementation independence include creating generic GUI components, such as for <strong class="source-inline">Window</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Scrollbar</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Textbox</strong>, and so on, for various platforms (derived classes). The implementation details can easily be hidden. Another example could be proprietary commercial classes in which the developer wishes to hide the implementation details that might otherwise be seen in a header file. </li>
