                    <h1 class="header-title">Basic Electronics</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated by electronics. When I was seven or eight years old, I can remember taking apart a hand-held transistor radio and struggling for several days to put it back together without letting my parents know I took it apart. Even though I would take little devices apart and put them back together, I really did not understand basic electronics until I took a basic electronics course in high school. That class gave me enough knowledge to begin to understand how the electronic devices that I have been taking apart actually worked. It also laid the foundation for all electronic projects that I have done since.</p>
<p>What you will learn in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>What the four building blocks of an electronic circuit are</li>
<li>What a multimeter is</li>
<li>What some of the more popular basic electronic components are</li>
<li>What the properties of electricity are</li>
<li>How to use Ohm's law</li>
<li>How to calculate power</li>
</ul>
<p>While the Arduino board was originally designed to abstract away the complicated details of the electronics to let the user focus on their project, we still need a basic understanding of electronics and electricity to connect external components to the Arduino board and to make sure we do not damage the board with those components. This chapter, along with <a href="de9d9edf-fdf1-410b-bb8a-98ef4b185166.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Circuit Diagrams</em> and <a href="f0039485-e47c-40c8-9130-fba1e1afd421.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Basic Prototyping</em>, are designed to give you a basic understanding of electronics, electricity, and circuits so you can build your own prototypes and work with the examples in the later chapters of this book.</p>
<p>All electronics and electricity covered in this book is related to <strong>direct current</strong> (<strong>DC</strong>), which is different from the <strong>alternating current</strong> (<strong>AC</strong>) that comes from wall outlets. DC current is the flow of electrical charge in one direction while AC current changes direction periodically. We only cover DC current in this book because it is inherently safer than AC current and the Arduino with its components are powered by DC power sources. We can power the Arduino by plugging a power adapter into a wall, as we saw in <a href="a46a0d68-6899-45e9-8f90-3ba0f15ad9e6.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>The Arduino</em>; however, the power adapter converts the AC power source to a DC power source.</p>
<p>Let's start exploring basic electronics by looking at the four main building blocks of any electronic project.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Electronic building block</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When I want to build something, whether it is prototyping something with the Arduino, coding an application or building wooden steps to our back door, I usually try to break the project down into individual blocks. It really helps me focus on each individual part of the design rather than getting overwhelmed by the whole design. We can usually break an electronic project into four separate blocks. The following diagram illustrates how these blocks work together:</p>
<div><img src="img/7ba511c6-2028-4ab1-8d99-fb41e3e677a8.png" style="width:17.42em;height:21.08em;"/></div>
<p>Let's look at each one of these blocks starting with the power supply.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Power supply</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The power supply is the source of electricity for the project. For most of the experiments in this book, the power supply will be some low-voltage DC power supply like the power sources discussed in the <em>Powering the Arduino</em> section of <a href="a46a0d68-6899-45e9-8f90-3ba0f15ad9e6.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a><em>,</em> <em>The Arduino</em>. We will also show how to use a 12V battery to power DC motors using a motor controller board in the later chapters of this book.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Input</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The input block will contain electronic components that give the control circuit information. These components give the control circuit the ability to sense the outside world. Some examples of input components would be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Buttons or switches:</strong> Buttons and switches can be used to turn the flow of electricity on or off. When they are in the off-state electricity will not flow through the circuit; however, when they are in the on-state electricity does flow through the circuit.</li>
<li><strong>Temperature sensors:</strong> Temperature sensors adjust the amount of resistance in a circuit based on the temperature causing the voltage to vary by the temperature. By reading the amount of voltage coming in, the control circuit can calculate the current temperature.</li>
<li><strong>Range finders:</strong> There are many types of range sensors; however, the basic idea is the voltage that is outputted by the sensor varies depending on how close an object is to it. Like the temperature sensor, the control circuit can then calculate the distance based on the voltage coming in.</li>
<li><strong>Proximity sensor:</strong> This is a sensor that is triggered when something gets within a certain distance of the sensor. A proximity sensor is usually either ON (full voltage) or OFF (no voltage).</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Output</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The output block will contain electronic components that do something. These components give the circuit the ability to interact with the outside world or to do something. Some examples of output components are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motors:</strong> Motors allow the circuit to turn something like a fan or wheels. This type of component turns electrical power into power that does work.</li>
<li><strong>LEDs:</strong> An LED can be used as indicators to give visual feedback to the user. This type of component will turn electrical power into light.</li>
<li><strong>Speaker:</strong> A speaker can be used to give audio feedback to the user. This type of component will turn electrical power into sound.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Control circuit</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The control circuit block is the electronic component that receives information from the input components, processes that information and controls the output components. For the purposes of this book, the control circuit will be the Arduino but keep in mind it is not required that we use the Arduino for the control circuit. We could create our own control circuit or use another type of microcontroller board like the <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> or <strong>BeagleBone Black</strong>.</p>
<p>This block diagram gives us a high-level view of our Arduino projects. The first thing that we will need to understand is what ties these blocks and the components in the blocks together. For this, we will need to have a basic understanding of electronics and electricity. Let's begin by looking at some tools and common electronic components. We will start by looking at probably the most important tool we have, in our toolbox, to help us with electronic projects: the multimeter.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Multimeter</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>A multimeter, also known as a Volt-Ohm-Milliameter, is an electronic measuring instrument that is typically used to measure voltage, current, and resistance. There are analog multimeters that operate by moving a pointer to display the measurement, but today most multimeters are digital with an LCD that is used to display exactly what the measurement is.</p>
<p>A multimeter can cost as low as USD $10 and up to USD $400 for a really nice Fluke 87V. Unless you are planning on using the multimeter for professional purposes, I would recommend getting a low-cost multimeter like the ones shown in the following photograph:</p>
<div><img src="img/ddd4d0d0-8b4e-4084-8962-2709097ebe23.png" style="width:37.92em;height:28.50em;"/></div>
<p>The digital multimeter has three main parts, which are the display, selection knob, and the probe ports.</p>
<p>The display will show what the measurement is. Some of the higher-end multimeters have a backlit display to make it easier to read in low light.</p>
<p>The selection knob is used to select what we wish to measure. Most multimeters will read resistance (ohms), voltage (volts), and current (amps). Some of the higher-end meters will have the ability to measure additional items and have additional features.</p>
<p>Probes are plugged into the probe ports, which are usually located on the front of the meter. The black probe should be plugged into the port labeled COM and the red probe will be plugged into one of the other ports depending on what is being measured. Really there is no difference between the red and black probes; however, it is good practice to always connect black probes and wires to common/ground and the red probes and wires to power since this is the standard.</p>
<p>Digital multimeters are very easy to use. We start off by selecting what we wish to measure using the selection knob. Then connect the black probe to one end of the circuit and the red probe to the other and the multimeter will display the measurement. The following photograph shows how we would measure the remaining voltage of a 9V battery:</p>
<div><img src="img/fc45143d-60bb-4f2f-bbc6-0bab1e859c0f.png" style="width:34.58em;height:25.92em;"/></div>
<p>You will notice that the selector knob is set to 20V, therefore, the meter will measure up to 20V. The following photograph shows how we could measure the resistance of a resistor:</p>
<div><img src="img/cdd917b7-77e6-42b7-b9cd-30cd06bc4b1d.png" style="width:30.92em;height:23.25em;"/></div>
<p>In this photograph, we are measuring a 330K Ohm resistor. If we happen to set the selection knob to low, we would overload the multimeter but almost all meters have protection, therefore, they will not be damaged by overloading them. When you overload a meter they typically show a 1 all the way to the left of the display as the following photograph shows:</p>
<div><img src="img/c184886b-5f11-4df6-b153-1d5ad78c4874.png" style="width:33.25em;height:27.00em;"/></div>
<p>In the preceding photograph, we are trying to measure a 330K Ohm resistor with the selection knob set for a maximum of 200K Ohms. If you are not comfortable using a multimeter I would recommend searching for <em>multimeter video tutorials</em> and watching a couple videos on how to use them.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Electronic components</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There are numerous types of electronic components that we will be using in our projects. These components can be obtained for a relatively low cost from many online retailers. It is important to be familiar with what some of the more popular components because they will be used in many of the circuits we create. Let's start off by looking at the component that we will be using is almost all circuits that we create, the resistor.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Resistor</h1>
                
            
            
                
<div><img src="img/5bd5c5d4-5ccb-4964-8f84-f7ea663b27ad.png" style="width:12.92em;height:11.83em;"/></div>
<p>The resistor will be used in almost every circuit that we create. A resistor is an electronic component that has a specific amount of electrical resistance that never changes. The resistor limits the flow of electrons in the circuit. We will see how resistance works a little later in this chapter.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Potentiometer</h1>
                
            
            
                
<div><img src="img/40b8d6ea-eae6-466c-a4c4-4bf90628ece6.png" style="width:14.58em;height:21.33em;"/></div>
<p>The potentiometer, also known as a pot, is a variable resistor. A potentiometer allows for the creation of a circuit where the user can change the resistance. Potentiometer comes in various shapes, sizes, and values but they all have three connectors. The resistance between the two outer connectors is fixed and is the maximum resistance of the potentiometer. The resistance between the center connector and either outer connection various as the user turns the knob.</p>
<p>The potentiometer has lots of usages including audio control, motion control for servo motors and control brightness of a light.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Switches</h1>
                
            
            
                
<div><img src="img/066247dd-596c-417a-b78d-0c46cb417e20.png" style="width:38.00em;height:16.67em;"/></div>
<p>There are several types of switches that can be used depending on the need. The preceding photograph shows, from left to right, a push button, micro and toggle switch.</p>
<p>The <strong>push button</strong> switches are switches that are activated by pressing a button. These switches are usually used to start or stop some action. Some examples usages for a push button switch would be to start a robot in motion, start a led blinking or capture the current measurement from a sensor.</p>
<p>The <strong>microswitch</strong> is a switch that is activated by a light force being applied to a lever or button on the switch. These switches are widely used in many household and industrial applications. Some examples of uses for a micro switch are end stops for a 3D printer, detecting if the door of a microwave is closed, and collision detection for robots.</p>
<p>The <strong>toggle switch</strong> is activated and deactivated by moving the lever to the on or off position. The toggle switch is mainly used to turn items on and off like a light switch.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Transistor</h1>
                
            
            
                
<div><img src="img/91deeb3a-a99a-438e-97e0-ed829d62226a.png" style="width:20.67em;height:20.67em;"/></div>
<p>Transistors are tiny switches that can be triggered by an electric signal. Transistors are the building blocks for the digital world that we live in today. Integrated circuits are made up of many tiny transistors. The transistor gives up the digital on/off a signal that all digital devices rely on.</p>
<p>A transistor has three connectors, which are known as the collector, base, and emitter. For NPN transistors collector is the leftmost pin followed by the base and emitter. For PNP transistors the leftmost pin is the emitter followed by the base and collector. The collector should be connected to an input power source. The emitter should be connected to a common ground in the circuit. The base, when a certain amount of voltage is applied, triggers the flow of electricity through the transistor. The base is what acts as a switch to turn the flow of electricity on or off.</p>
<p>For a DC circuit, like the ones we will be using in this book, all of the components need to be connected to a common ground. For example, if you have a battery that powers the Arduino and a battery that powers the DC motors, the ground (negative) terminals will need to be connected together so all of the components are connected to the same ground. This is known as having a common ground in the circuit.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">LED</h1>
                
            
            
                
<div><img src="img/f4ad8191-b541-4f32-be81-20840ef6c940.png" style="width:6.17em;height:16.58em;"/></div>
<p>The <strong>Light Emitting Diode</strong> or <strong>LED</strong> for short, is a two-lead semiconducting device that emits light when a certain amount of current is passed through. When using a LED, we need to be very careful not to apply too much current because it is very easy to blow one. For most LED, the recommended voltage would be 5 volts.</p>
<p>Most LEDs have two different size connectors. The long connector is the anode and should be connected to a power source. The short connector is a cathode and should be connected to a common ground.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Capacitor</h1>
                
            
            
                
<div><img src="img/9f2d49a5-a206-4909-9758-3c93dd1dd0fb.png" style="width:13.00em;height:17.25em;"/></div>
<p>Capacitors come in many shapes, sizes and capacities. The preceding photograph displays two small capacitors that could be used in low-power circuits like we will be using in this book.</p>
<p>A capacitor stores and discharges electricity similar to a battery, except the capacitor charges and discharges rapidly often in seconds or fractions of seconds. The capacitor is used in almost all electronic devices for various reasons. The capacitor can be used to smooth the flow of electricity, filter the flow of electricity to only allow so much through or for a large quick burst of electricity like a camera flash.</p>
<p>We should be very careful when dealing with capacitors to make sure they are fully discharged before handling them to avoid getting an electrical shock.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Integrated circuit</h1>
                
            
            
                
<div><img src="img/e4f7332c-8d1a-45fb-b26d-a94969b3aa2a.png" style="width:31.58em;height:23.67em;"/></div>
<p>An <strong>integrated circuit</strong>, or <strong>IC</strong> for short, is a semiconductor wafer that contains thousands or millions of tiny resistors, transistors, and capacitors that are used to perform certain functions. There are millions of different types of IC and one example is the Atmel ATmega128 microcontroller used in the Arduino. Virtually all electronics have some integrated circuits in them.</p>
<p>Now that we have seen the more popular electronic components that will make up the projects in this book, let's see what electricity is.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What is electricity?</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Everything in the universe is made up of atoms. Atoms are made up of three primary components, which are the proton, neutron, and electron. The protons and neutrons make up the nucleus of the atom while the electrons orbit the nucleus like the moon orbits the Earth. The proton has a positive charge and the electron has a negative charge.</p>
<p>Electricity is created when particles become charged. Some particles become positively charged while others becomes negatively charged. Particles with opposite charges attract each other while particles with the same charge repel each other.</p>
<p>Since the electrons are in constant motion, occasionally an electron will escape from its atom and joins another atom. The atom that the electron escaped from now will have a net positive charge while the atom that gained the electron while having a net negative charge. Electricity is this flow of electrons.</p>
<p>The electrical conductivity of a metal is measured by how easily an electron can escape from its atom. Copper, Silver, and Gold are some of the best conductive materials because they have only a single valence, or outer shell, an electron that moves with little resistance.</p>
<p>If we connected a copper wire from one end of a battery to the other, as shown in the following diagram, the flow of electrons would go from the negatively charged end to the positively charged end.</p>
<p>Do not actually do this, the wire could get very hot and the battery will drain very quickly.</p>
<div><img src="img/fccf994c-a30c-4386-813f-755c88ed04a3.png" style="width:18.75em;height:30.00em;"/></div>
<p>The reason that electricity flows in this manner is oppositely charged particles attract therefor the positively charged end attracts the electrons causing them to flow from the negatively charged end. One of the easiest ways to envision the flow of electrons is to look at how water flows through a pipe. Now let's look at some properties of electricity starting with how we would measure the flow of electrons.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Current</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Current, in an electronic circuit, is the flow of the charged particles (electrons). The current is measured by the number of charged particles passing the point of the circuit, that is being measured, per second.</p>
<p>Current is measured in amperes and can be measured with most standard multimeters. One ampere is equal to 6.241×10<sup>18</sup> electrons passing the point being measured per second.</p>
<p>If we think of electricity as water flowing through a pipe, the following diagram will help visualize what current is:</p>
<div><img src="img/44505d12-b9a6-4d87-b325-382f14bda4ba.png" style="width:32.83em;height:26.00em;"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Voltage</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Voltage is the amount of potential energy between two points, where one point has more charged particles than the other. The difference in this charge is called the voltage. We can think of the voltage as the pressure within the circuit to push the charged particles through the circuit. Voltage is measured in volts.</p>
<p>To continue with the water in a pipe analogy, we can think of voltage as the water pressure within the pipe pushing the water through. The following diagram illustrates this:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Resistance</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Resistance is how much the flow of current is reduced or impeded. All circuits have some resistance from the wire and components that make up the circuit; however, most circuits include resistors that add extra resistance to the circuit. These resistors enable us to limit the flow of charged particles within the circuit. Resistance is measured in Ohms.</p>
<p>Using the water in a pipe analogy again, resistance is the smallest part of the pipe that is impeding the water flow.</p>

<p>Now let's see how these three properties work together by examining Ohm's law.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Ohm's law</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Ohm's law stated that the current flowing through a circuit is directly proportional to the voltage applied to the circuit. This means that if the voltage of the circuit increases, then the current will also increase if the resistance stays the same.</p>
<p>Ohm's law also states that current flowing through a circuit is inversely proportional to the resistance of the circuit. This means that if the resistance of a circuit increases, then the current flow will decrease if the voltage stays the same.</p>
<p>The standard formula for Ohm's law states that the current is equal to the voltage divided by the resistance:</p>
<div><img src="img/ea590cdf-0437-4da9-ba96-635cf7358fc2.png" style="width:16.50em;height:19.75em;"/></div>
<p>While the preceding formula is how Ohm's law is usually introduced, it really consists of three formulas:</p>
<p><em>I </em>= <em>V</em>/<em>R</em></p>
<p><em>R </em>= <em>V</em>/<em>I</em></p>
<p><em>V </em>= <em>I</em>*<em>R</em></p>
<p>In this book, we will use the <em>R </em>= <em>V</em>/<em>I</em> the most to calculate the resistance needed to limit the current flow of the circuits. We limit the current flowing in a circuit by adding resistors to it.</p>
<p>There is one other formula that we should know when working with electronic components. This formula is used to calculate power.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What is power?</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Power is the amount of electrical energy transformed into another type of energy (heat, light or work) per second. Power is an important concept because it is what allows our electric circuit to do something. For example, if we created a circuit with a battery and a resistor, the resistor will convert the electrical energy to heat (or thermal) energy. All resistors also have a maximum power rating that they can handle therefore to ensure that we do not damage the resistors in a circuit we will need to know how to calculate power. Power is calculated by multiplying the voltage by the current and is measured in Watts.</p>
<div><img src="img/b36ba9c1-6666-4e85-ac28-c08504b2ab6f.png" style="width:12.50em;height:7.92em;"/></div>
<p>Most of the low-cost resistors that we can get from online retailers are rated at 1/4 (or 0.25) Watts so we will assume that the resistors we are using for the projects in this book are rated at that 1/4 Watt. Now let's say in our project we are running a voltage of 10V across a 100 Ohm resistor, do you think the resistor will be able to handle it? To figure this out, the first thing we need to do is to calculate the current using Ohm's law. We will use the formula <em>I </em>= <em>V</em>/<em>R</em> to calculate the current (<em>I </em>= 10V/100 Ohms) and come up with a current of 0.1 Amps. We can now use the formula <em>P </em>= <em>V</em>*<em>I</em> to calculate the power (<em>P</em>=0.1A * 10V) which would equal 1 Watt, which is four times what the resistor is rated for, therefore the resistor will get very hot and may even get damaged.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Resistor color codes</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The value of a resistor is marked on its body using color bands. The majority of the resistors contain four bands but there are also some resistors that have five and six bands. The following picture shows what a resistor with four bands looks like:</p>
<div><img src="img/448fb7c6-2182-4f90-beda-432323a48695.png" style="width:8.42em;height:7.67em;"/></div>
<p>With a four-band resistor the first two bands, from left to right, indicate the resistor's value. The third band is the multiplier and the fourth band is the tolerance. Resistors that have five bands use the first three bands to indicate the resistor's value, then the fourth band is the multiplier and the fifth band is the tolerance. The following table shows the color values:</p>

<p>The resistor pictured the beginning of this section has four bands coloured Yellow-Violet-Orange-Silver, which means the resistor is a 47K Ohm with 10% tolerance. We know this because the first two bands (Yellow and Violet) have values of 4 and 7. We then use the third band (Orange) as the multiplier which is 1K. This gives us a resistance value of 47 multiplied by 1K or 47K. The fourth band (Silver) indicates a tolerance of 10%.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we gave a very brief introduction to electricity and some of the more popular electronic components that we will be using later in this book. This chapter will give you enough knowledge to get you started building very basic prototypes. It is recommended that once you start more advanced projects you do further reading on electricity and electronic components.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will look at circuits and how to read circuit diagrams.</p>
