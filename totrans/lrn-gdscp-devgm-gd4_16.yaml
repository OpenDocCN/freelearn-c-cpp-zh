    intermediate understanding and creating a whole game from scratch within one book.
    I know that it isn’t always easy to understand everything on the first go, but
    that is how we learn. We have to fail at something and try it over and over –
    each time getting better at the thing we are trying to learn.

    painter or the blank page of a writer. Starting something new is hard. That is
    why I like to provide some ideas to get you started. And don’t worry about what
    project is the ideal one. From here on out, any project that interests you is
    a good one to try out. Just make sure to keep them small and finish them so that
    people can play what you have made.

    games, that you can make.'

    while the unfinished ones were never played by anyone.'

    for too long. When learning to create and design games, it is best to keep projects
    small and not over-polish a single game. It is often better to consider something
    as done, let people play it, and then move on to the next project – this is until
    you feel confident enough in your skills to tackle a bigger game.

- en: The intention of this whole book was to get new people to start creating games
    in the Godot Engine. We went from knowing absolutely nothing about programming
    or game development to a very solid and intermediate understanding of both.

- en: At the start, we learned how to us GDScript as our language of choice, learning
    about the basic concepts, such as variables and loops, and progressing to more
    intermediate topics, such as classes and proper programming guidelines. We eventually
    made our way to advanced topics, such as the super keyword and programming patterns.

- en: During the book, we also developed our own game, a small survival game modeled
    after *Vampire Survivors*. We saw what nodes are and which ones we should use
    in all kinds of different situations. We even made the game multiplayer and published
    it on **Itch.io**, ready to be played by anyone who would like to do so!

  zh: 在这本书中，我们还开发了自己的游戏，一款模仿 *Vampire Survivors* 的小型生存游戏。我们了解了节点是什么，以及在各种不同情况下应该使用哪些节点。我们甚至让游戏支持多人模式，并在
    **Itch.io** 上发布，供任何想玩的人游玩！
- en: I hope you had a great time learning how to program and use the Godot Engine,
    and I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for sticking around
    until the end. Now go out there and create some awesome games!
