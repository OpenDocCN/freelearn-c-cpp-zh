<h1 id="_idParaDest-288"><a id="_idTextAnchor289"/>Adding Epic Online Services (EOS)</h1>
<p>When developing multiplayer games, it is important to add online services to the overall experience in order to enable players to connect and play with other people over the internet. This is especially important for games that require a large number of players or that are played by people in different locations of the world. Adding online services allows players to enjoy a more social gaming experience and increases the overall fun and engagement of the game. Plus, it also allows the game developer to gather data and feedback from players, which can be useful for improving the game and fixing any issues that arise.</p>
<p>In this chapter, I will be presenting you with <strong class="bold">Epic Online Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">EOS</strong>), a cloud platform that provides developers with the<a id="_idIndexMarker837"/> tools to create, deploy, and operate high-performance gaming experiences. Developed by Epic Games, this powerful platform brings together all of its existing technologies and expertise into one unified system. With its scalable infrastructure and advanced features such as analytics and cloud hosting capabilities, Epic Games EOS allows developers to build games optimized for maximum performance on any device or operating system.</p>
<p>Through the next sections, I will present you the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing EOS</li>
<li>Accessing the Developer Portal</li>
<li>Getting started with the EOS SDK</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-289"><a id="_idTextAnchor290"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p>To follow the topics presented in this chapter, you should have completed all the previous chapters and have understood their content.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-290"><a id="_idTextAnchor291"/>Introducing EOS</h1>
<p>EOS (<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/en-US/services">https://dev.epicgames.com/en-US/services</a>) is a powerful suite of services and tools designed<a id="_idIndexMarker838"/> to help developers create the most immersive online<a id="_idIndexMarker839"/> experiences possible. With EOS, developers can easily manage user authentication, matchmaking, leaderboards, achievements, and more – all from one centralized system. Whether you’re working on an MMO or a single-player game with online features such as multiplayer mode or leaderboards, EOS has something to offer every developer looking to take their games further. One thing to mention is that all services are free to use, even if you don’t use an Epic Games account.</p>
<p>EOS can be categorized into three distinct sets of services:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Game Services</strong>, which<a id="_idIndexMarker840"/> covers multiplayer functionalities, such as sessions, lobbies, or achievements</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Account Services</strong>, which <a id="_idIndexMarker841"/>covers player identity, such as authentication and profile handling, and friend management</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Store Services</strong>, which <a id="_idIndexMarker842"/>covers Epic Games store transactions, including catalog management and verification</li>
</ul>
<p>Game Services can also be used with any identity provider, such as Discord, Steam, Google, and, of course, Epic Games; this means players won’t need an Epic Game account in order to get access to these services. On the other hand, Account Services and Store Services can only be used with an Epic Games account.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">In case you are wondering, EOS does not include a cloud machine to host a Dedicated Server (like the one you built in <a href="B18203_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor275"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deploying Multiplayer Games</em>). To host your server in<a id="_idIndexMarker843"/> the cloud, you will need to use services such as <strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>) or <strong class="bold">Microsoft Azure</strong>. The official Epic Games documentation has a dedicated section on<a id="_idIndexMarker844"/> this topic and can be found on this <a id="_idIndexMarker845"/>web page: <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/unreal-engine-cloud-deployments/">https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/unreal-engine-cloud-deployments/</a>.</p>
<p>EOS is <a id="_idIndexMarker846"/>accessible via the <strong class="bold">Epic Games Developer Portal</strong>, which<a id="_idIndexMarker847"/> is a browser-based tool that enables users to configure and set up their games through a list of developer resources. In addition to the EOS, the Developer Portal also offers the functionality to manage the games that you may have made available in the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>Upon successful registration for a Developer Portal account, you will gain the capability to manage your products, configure services, and establish settings for identity providers and available platforms. Additional features provided within the Developer Portal include the ability for users to update game information, provide support for players, manage game finances, and access usage reports and statistical data.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that the Developer Portal is intended to be cross-platform-compatible, giving developers the capability to deploy their games across an array of different platforms – such as consoles, desktops, and mobile devices – while utilizing a single service for managing gameplay across all of these platforms. This functionality helps to provide a cohesive and seamless experience for players across these different platforms.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">As the Developer Portal and EOS are web-based, they remain in a perpetual state of development. Consequently, it is possible to encounter inconsistencies or variations in the features and functionality described in the following sections. Despite any discrepancies, you should still be able to navigate and engage with these services effectively and with minimal disruption to the overall experience.</p>
<p>As <a id="_idIndexMarker848"/>EOS is a huge topic on its own – and not meant to work just for Unreal Engine but with many developer platforms – having a full understanding of it is out of this book’s scope; however, in the following sections, I will guide you through the main parts of the Developer Portal, EOS, and their peculiarities, so you will have a solid base to use them in your games.</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to start creating your own organization in order to grant you access to all the features available in the cloud service.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-291"><a id="_idTextAnchor292"/>Accessing the Developer Portal</h1>
<p>In this section, I will guide you<a id="_idIndexMarker849"/> through the creation of a Developer Portal account in order to properly set up and manage your own projects, whether they are multiplayer or not. The steps you will need to complete to get your game ready are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up an Epic Games account (you should have one already) and creating an organization for the Developer Portal</li>
<li>Creating a Product</li>
<li>Configuring the Product</li>
</ul>
<p>So, let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-292"><a id="_idTextAnchor293"/>Accessing the Epic Games Developer Portal</h2>
<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker850"/>first thing you need to do in order to access and use the Epic Games Developer Portal is to create <a id="_idIndexMarker851"/>an <strong class="bold">organization</strong> – this is a group that holds the responsibility for both creating and owning Products within the Epic Games Developer Portal.</p>
<p>Start by <a id="_idIndexMarker852"/>accessing the dedicated web page, which can be found at this link: <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/portal">https://dev.epicgames.com/portal</a>. After logging in with your Epic Games account, you will be presented with a registration form where you will need to insert an organization name and an email, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.1</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.1 – The organization creation form" src="img/Figure_15_01_B18203.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.1 – The organization creation form</p>
<p>Once <a id="_idIndexMarker853"/>you have registered, you will be granted access to the Developer Portal, where you will be able to manage your organization, download the EOS SDK, create your projects, and, most importantly, set up them.</p>
<p>As the creator of the organization, you will be responsible for setting up all the needed information for it, such as tax and payout information if you plan to generate some revenue from your games.</p>
<p>Additionally, unless you plan to work as a one-man army, you’ll be able to invite additional members to the organization itself. This feature is available in the <strong class="bold">Organization | Members</strong> section. Each member can be assigned a role, to get access to some, or all of, the features available in the organization. You can create your own roles, each with its custom access level, but Epic Games has already created some for you; some of these roles are listed here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Admin</strong>: This role will grant the member access to all functionalities in the Portal. It is the role automatically assigned to the organization creator (i.e., you).</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Community Tools</strong>: This role will give the member access to all community-related features, such as game analytics, accounts, and the ticketing system.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Payout</strong>: This role will give the member access to all finance-related sections, such as payout and reports.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re<a id="_idIndexMarker854"/> working in a game studio – even if it’s a small one – having this kind of member access is going to be really important to make everything work perfectly.</p>
<p>Once the organization has been properly set up and you have a well-organized team, the next thing to do is to create your first Product, be it a multiplayer game or anything else.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-293"><a id="_idTextAnchor294"/>Creating a Product</h2>
<p>Once you are inside an <a id="_idIndexMarker855"/>organization, you will need to create a <strong class="bold">Product</strong> – this is a game or a software project that contains some EOS logic. Once a Product has been created, it will be assigned a <a id="_idIndexMarker856"/>default <strong class="bold">Sandbox</strong>, which is a development environment that will contain the distribution data, such as store-related or specific deployment information. At the time of writing this book, Epic Games provides the following default Sandboxes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Dev</strong>: Used for editing and configuring a Product at development time</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Stage</strong>: Used for testing a Product for readiness</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Live</strong>: Used to distribute a Product on the Epic Games Store</li>
</ul>
<p>Inside a Sandbox, you will be able to create one or<a id="_idIndexMarker857"/> more <strong class="bold">Deployment</strong>, a specific distribution that will store all gameplay and player data, such as achievements and current matches.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s imagine you want to implement some services for the Unreal Shadows game, and you don’t want to make things too complicated. First of all, you will need to create a dedicated Product and then you will work with a single Sandbox; inside the Sandbox, you will use the aforementioned deployment environment depending on your needs. For example, see the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong class="bold">Dev</strong> environment, you will conduct development and internal testing for your project</li>
<li>In the <strong class="bold">Stage</strong> environment, you will test the game</li>
<li>In the <strong class="bold">Live</strong> environment, you will ship the game as an official release</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s now<a id="_idIndexMarker858"/> imagine that, during your game development, you (or the game design team) decide to add a new experimental feature, such as a voice chat for all the players. You’ll create a new deployment, called <strong class="bold">Dev-Experimental-VOIP</strong>, and test its functionalities internally. Once this feature is solid and ready for a release, you will simply have to add it to your <strong class="bold">Stage</strong> deployment and, once it is solid enough, to the <strong class="bold">Live</strong> deployment.</p>
<p>As a practical example, we’ll create a demo Product. Inside your <strong class="bold">Developer Portal Dashboard</strong>, click the <strong class="bold">Create Product</strong> button, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.2</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.2 – Creating a new Product" src="img/Figure_15_02_B18203.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.2 – Creating a new Product</p>
<p>You will get a pop-up window where you will need to insert the Product name. In my case, I opted for <code>EOS Demo</code>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.3</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.3 – Naming the Product" src="img/Figure_15_03_B18203.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.3 – Naming the Product</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">Once created a Product, you won’t be able to change its name, so choose wisely!</p>
<p>If this is the first<a id="_idIndexMarker859"/> Product you have created with your organization, you’ll be asked to review some agreements with Epic Games, involving topics such as store distribution and marketing subscriber lists; read them carefully and, if you agree with the terms, click the <strong class="bold">Accept</strong> button. Once accepted, you will probably be asked to pay a submission fee; just skip this as it’s about the Epic Games Store and not related to the Game Services we are interested in at the moment – you may need in the future once you decide to publish your games on the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>Now that you have created your own Product, you are ready for the next step, configuring the services you will be using.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-294"><a id="_idTextAnchor295"/>Configuring the Product services</h2>
<p>To access your project page, all you<a id="_idIndexMarker860"/> have to do is click on your Product link – in my case, the <strong class="bold">EOS Demo</strong> Product – in your Developer Portal, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.4</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.4 – Selecting the product configuration" src="img/Figure_15_04_B18203.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.4 – Selecting the product configuration</p>
<p>Once you are on the Product page, you can access its settings by clicking <strong class="bold">Product Settings</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.5</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.5 – The Product Settings section" src="img/Figure_15_05_B18203.jpg"/>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.5 – The Product Settings section</p>
<p>You are <a id="_idIndexMarker861"/>now able to create an EOS Client for your application.</p>
<h3>Creating an EOS Client</h3>
<p>In the context of Epic <a id="_idIndexMarker862"/>Online Services, the term <strong class="bold">Client</strong> refers to a program that utilizes the functionality of EOS for a particular Product. This can encompass locally installed game builds that end users operate on their systems, dedicated servers maintained by the Product’s owners, or any other program that necessitates access to the backend services that EOS provides. Each Client will have its own ID and secret password for authentication.</p>
<p>Each Client will also have its own <strong class="bold">Client Policy</strong>, which will determine the level of access for the features that will be implemented. This means that, if you are creating a multiplayer game using EOS, your dedicated server will need its own EOS Client, and the player’s clients will have their own dedicated EOS Clients. On the other hand, if you plan to distribute a listen server version of your game, you will need just one EOS Client for your game.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling a bit confused by the term “Client” in this context, don’t worry – I felt the same way the first time I read the official EOS documentation! To help with this, let’s actually create a Client:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Clients</strong> link in the main page toolbar, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.6</em>:</li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.6 – The Clients section" src="img/Figure_15_06_B18203.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.6 – The Clients section</p>
<p>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add New Client</strong> button; this will open the <strong class="bold">Add New Client</strong> window (shown later in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.8</em>).</p>
<ol>
<li value="2">In the <code>EOS </code><code>Demo Client</code>.</li>
<li>Click on <code>EOS </code><code>Demo Policy</code>.</li><li>In the <strong class="bold">Client policy type</strong>, you can choose one of the pre-made configuration or you can create a custom one. For the purpose of this example, I chose the <strong class="bold">GameClient</strong> options, which are configured to manage untrusted Client applications and, as such, will require an authenticated user.</li><li>The previous selection will enable a list of additional options, such as <strong class="bold">Leaderboards</strong>, <strong class="bold">Matchmaking</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Lobbies</strong>, which you will be able to change, depending on your own needs.</li><li>Once you are happy with your Client’s configuration, click <strong class="bold">ADD NEW CLIENT POLICY</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.7</em>:</li></ol></li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.7 – The Client policy creation" src="img/Figure_15_07_B18203.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.7 – The Client policy creation</p>
<ol>
<li value="4">Once the Client <a id="_idIndexMarker864"/>policy has been created, you will be brought back to the Client creation. Click the <strong class="bold">Add New Client</strong> button, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.8</em>:</li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.8 – The Client creation" src="img/Figure_15_08_B18203.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.8 – The Client creation</p>
<p>Once the Client has <a id="_idIndexMarker865"/>been created, you will be brought back to the Product page and you should see listed both the Client and the Client policy, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.9</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.9 – The Client and the Client Policy on the Product settings page" src="img/Figure_15_09_B18203.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.9 – The Client and the Client Policy on the Product settings page</p>
<p>In the <strong class="bold">Client</strong> section, you<a id="_idIndexMarker866"/> will notice the features that have been enabled for this Client and its ID, which will be used when connecting to the services.</p>
<h3>Accessing Epic Account Services</h3>
<p>Now that the <a id="_idIndexMarker867"/>Client has been created, you need to access the <strong class="bold">Epic Account Services</strong> section of your Product page, in order to finalize the EOS configuration. To access this section, click the <strong class="bold">Epic Account Services</strong> button, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.10</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.10 – The Epic Account Services section" src="img/Figure_15_10_B18203.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.10 – The Epic Account Services section</p>
<p>The first thing to <a id="_idIndexMarker868"/>do is to configure the permissions for the Client so, click the <strong class="bold">Permissions</strong> button in the <strong class="bold">EOS Demo</strong> application section, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.11</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.11 – The PERMISSIONS section" src="img/Figure_15_11_B18203.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.11 – The PERMISSIONS section</p>
<p>Unless you want to add some custom configuration, you will just need to click on the <strong class="bold">SAVE CHANGES</strong> button, in order to initialize the permissions configuration. This will set this section as <strong class="bold">CONFIGURED</strong>, as depicted in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.12</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.12 – The configured PERMISSIONS section" src="img/Figure_15_12_B18203.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.12 – The configured PERMISSIONS section</p>
<p>Next, you need to <a id="_idIndexMarker869"/>select the <strong class="bold">Linked Clients</strong> section in order to set the previously created Client as the selected one. Once you are in the <strong class="bold">Linked Clients</strong> section, all you need to do is to select your Client – in this case, <strong class="bold">EOS Demo Client</strong> – from the drop-down menu and click the <strong class="bold">SAVE CHANGES</strong> button. This will set this section as <strong class="bold">CONFIGURED</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.13</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.13 – The configured LINKED CLIENTS section" src="img/Figure_15_13_B18203.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.13 – The configured LINKED CLIENTS section</p>
<p>The <strong class="bold">BRAND SETTINGS</strong> section can be left unconfigured at a development stage because it will be required only once you are in a release phase and your application will need to be reviewed and approved by Epic Games.</p>
<p>Once you are<a id="_idIndexMarker870"/> done with this, your application is ready, and EOS can be connected with your game or application.</p>
<p>In this section, you have been introduced to the Epic Games Developer Portal and its online services. As you have seen, you will need to access the portal in order to initialize and configure the cloud features you will implement in your game. In the next section, I will give you a brief introduction to the tools that you’ll use in your game, to integrate it with the EOS environment.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-295"><a id="_idTextAnchor296"/>Getting started with the EOS SDK</h1>
<p>The <strong class="bold">EOS SDK</strong> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker871"/> tool that’s independent of any particular game engine, providing developers access to several cross-platform services that can be integrated into their games. Depending on the game engine being utilized, the level of integration options available to incorporate the EOS SDK into the game will vary. Nonetheless, the method of integration is at the discretion of the development team, and they may even use a combination of integration options.</p>
<p>In order to start using the EOS SDK you will have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download it from the Developer Portal</li>
<li>Integrate it into your game</li>
</ul>
<p>In this section, I will give you a brief walkthrough on how to get the SDK and to understand the basic concepts on how to integrate it in your project.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-296"><a id="_idTextAnchor297"/>Downloading the EOS SDK</h2>
<p>To download the SDK, go<a id="_idIndexMarker872"/> to your <strong class="bold">Developer Portal Dashboard</strong> page and click the <strong class="bold">SDK &amp; Release Notes</strong> button, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.14</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.14 – The download SDK button" src="img/Figure_15_14_B18203.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.14 – The download SDK button</p>
<p>As stated before, the SDK is meant to target multiple developer platforms and so you will get multiple download options (i.e., the SDK for C, C#, iOS, or Android), as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.15</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.15 – The download options" src="img/Figure_15_15_B18203.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.15 – The download options</p>
<p>After choosing <a id="_idIndexMarker873"/>your preferred platform, the download will start. Once it's finished, you will be able to start integrating the SDK with your own application.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-297"><a id="_idTextAnchor298"/>Integrating the system into your game</h2>
<p>No matter which game engine you decide to use, you can totally use the EOS SDK in your game! All you need to do – after having configured the Product in the Developer Portal and having downloaded the SDK – is to write your integration to your game engine of choice.</p>
<p>If you plan to integrate the SDK with an Unreal Engine project, there are two options to integrate the EOS SDK:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the EOS <strong class="bold">Online Subsystem</strong> (<strong class="bold">OSS</strong>) plugin</li>
<li>Use a third-party plugin or write one on your own</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at both options.</p>
<h3>Using the EOS Online Subsystem</h3>
<p>As you have <a id="_idIndexMarker874"/>already seen in <a href="B18203_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor239"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a><em class="italic">, Managing Multiplayer Sessions</em>, the OSS in Unreal Engine is a tool that provides a uniform way of accessing the numerous online features provided by different online services by means of a set of plugins. This includes Xbox Live, Steam and, finally, the Epic Online Services – through the dedicated EOS OSS plugin – making <a id="_idIndexMarker875"/>it immensely valuable in game development workflows that support multiple platforms or online services. With this in mind, you will be able to easily configure your game’s EOS settings within the Unreal Editor without the need for coding.</p>
<p>To access the EOS OSS, you will have to enable the plugin in Unreal Engine. This is quite easy to achieve. Once you have opened your Unreal Engine project, all you will have to do is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong class="bold">Edit | Plugins</strong> from the main menu.</li>
<li>Enable the <strong class="bold">Online Subsystem EOS</strong> and <strong class="bold">EOS </strong><strong class="bold">Shared </strong>plugins.</li>
<li>Restart the Unreal Engine in order to initialize the plugins.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the plugins have been enabled, you will need to setup your project, to connect it with the EOS Product you have previously created. This setup is pretty long but quite straightforward; you can find instructions on how to do this in the official documentation, found here: <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/online-subsystem-eos-plugin-in-unreal-engine/">https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/online-subsystem-eos-plugin-in-unreal-engine/</a>. You can also find more information about the OSS plugin, which is out of the scope of the book.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that at the time of writing this book, some of the EOS SDK interfaces haven’t been developed yet in the EOS OSS plugin and so they will not be available out-of-the-box. The interfaces that aren’t still available are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anti-cheat interface</li>
<li>Reports interface</li>
<li>Sanctions interface</li>
<li>Custom Invites interface</li>
</ul>
<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker876"/>means that if your game needs these features, you will have to write your own plugin, or use a third-party one.</p>
<h3>Using a third-party plugin</h3>
<p>As stated before, the other <a id="_idIndexMarker877"/>option for integrating your game with the EOS SDK is to develop your own plugin in Unreal Engine.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">The EOS SDK needs to be initialized inside a plugin – writing your own implementation inside your project may result in unexpected behaviours or some interfaces not working at all.</p>
<p>Developing your own plugin in Unreal Engine is a wonderful way to hone your skills and bring them to the next level. To get started, the best advice is to read the official documentation that thoroughly describes the process of developing and managing plugins in Unreal Engine. The <a id="_idIndexMarker878"/>documentation page can be found by following this link: <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/plugins-in-unreal-engine/">https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/plugins-in-unreal-engine/</a>.</p>
<p>However, if you feel uncomfortable with plugin development, you can take advantage of the Unreal <a id="_idIndexMarker879"/>Engine Marketplace (<a href="https://unrealengine.com/marketplace">https://unrealengine.com/marketplace</a>) and look for a commercial solution. As an example, a couple of amazing integration tools <a id="_idIndexMarker880"/>are <strong class="bold">EOS Online Subsystem</strong> (<a href="https://unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/eos-online-subsystem">https://unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/eos-online-subsystem</a>) developed by Redpoint Games <a id="_idIndexMarker881"/>and <strong class="bold">EOS Integration Kit</strong> (<a href="https://unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/eos-integration-kit">https://unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/eos-integration-kit</a>) developed by Betide Studio. Both offer seamless integration with EOS and almost all service interfaces are exposed, in order to make your multiplayer game easier and more efficient to develop and maintain.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that both plugins offer some sort of free or open source license, so you can test them out in order to check if they are the right tool for you. Buying them will, of course, help the development team maintain the plugin and add new features as time goes<a id="_idIndexMarker882"/> by.</p>
<p>Now that you have the basic knowledge on EOS, it’s time to start working on your soon-to-be successful game and integrate it with some (or all!) of the services offered by Epic Games.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">To learn about all the features that come shipped with EOS, you can start by checking the official <a id="_idIndexMarker883"/>documentation that can be found on this web page: <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-online-services">https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-online-services</a>.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-298"><a id="_idTextAnchor299"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this final chapter of the book, I have presented you to the Developer Portal and the EOS platform. You accessed the Developer Portal in order to create your own Product and to connect it with any kind of application or game. You have also seen how the basic structure of an EOS application is made and initialized with some basic and default settings.</p>
<p>Finally, you have learned that you can integrate these services with any development platform, including Unreal Engine; this can be achieved by using the official – but, at the moment, incomplete – plugin, you can use a third-party integration system, or you can even write your own code so that you will focus on what you really need.</p>
<p>As you guessed, there’s a lot more on this and you have just started scratching the surface of this environment. My final advice is to try the services and explore all the interfaces offered by the SDK. Experiment by writing your own code and – if you feel courageous enough – create your own plugin; I assure you, if you are a game programmer, this will be super-fun! (But, maybe, this topic might be best left for another book!)</p>
<p>And that’s the end of <em class="italic">Multiplayer Game Development with Unreal Engine 5</em>. It has been a pleasure to share my knowledge and experience with you, and I am confident that you now know how to create amazing multiplayer games for your soon-to-be players.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me on this journey and may the odds be ever in your projects’ favor!</p>
