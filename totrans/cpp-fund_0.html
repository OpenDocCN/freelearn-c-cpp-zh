			<p><em class="italics">C++ Fundamentals</em> begins by introducing you to the C++ compilation model and syntax. You will then study data types, variable declaration, scope and control flow statements. With the help of this book, you'll be able to compile fully working C++ code and understand how variables, references, and pointers can be used to manipulate the state of the program. Next, you will explore functions and classes — the features that C++ offers to organize a program — and use them to solve more complex problems. You will also understand common pitfalls and modern best practices, especially the ones that diverge from the C++98 guidelines.</p>
			<p>As you advance through the chapters, you'll study the advantages of generic programming and write your own templates to make generic algorithms that work with any type. This C++ book will guide you in fully exploiting standard containers and algorithms, understanding how to pick the appropriate one for each problem.</p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you will not only be able to write efficient code, but also be equipped to improve the readability, performance, and maintainability of your programs.</p>

			<p><strong class="bold">Francesco Zoffoli</strong> is a professional software engineer currently working for Bloomberg LP in London. He became an enthusiast about modern C++ when joining the financial industry after a master degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. He is passionate about programming languages, maintainable software, and large distributed systems. He uses C++ for his projects as well as his day-to-day job to deliver scalable, efficient, and resilient systems.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Antonio Mallia</strong> is a C++ enthusiast with half a decade of experience in the industry as a software engineer and is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in computer science at NYU Tandon School of Engineering in New York City. His research interest is mainly related to information retrieval, with a strong focus on improving the efficiency of large-scale systems. For this reason, C++ plays a vital role in most of his projects and contributes to their success.</p>
