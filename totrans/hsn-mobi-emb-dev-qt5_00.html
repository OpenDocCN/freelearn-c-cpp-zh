                    <h1 class="header-title">Preface</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">Qt is everywhere these days. From your typical home computer to cloud servers, mobile phones, machine automation, coffee machines, medical devices, and embedded devices of all kinds, even in some of the classiest automobiles. It might even be somewhere in space, too! Even watches run Qt these days.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The <strong>Internet of Things</strong> (<strong>IoT</strong>) and home automation are big buzzwords that Qt is also a part of. As I like to say, there's no IoT without sensors! Would I write a book on Qt development without mentioning sensors? No. So, we will also dive into Qt Sensors as well.</p>
<p>There's no shortage of target devices these days, that's for sure. But in this book, we will only specifically target mobile phone platforms and Raspberry Pi to demonstrate some of the embedded features of Qt. Because Qt is cross-platform, you should still come away with knowledge on how to target coffee makers, too!</p>
<p class="mce-root">One consideration to make is which UI framework is going to be used. Using OpenGL is a viable option for mobile devices, especially if there is hardware support. I deliberately skip discussing OpenGL, as that is quite complicated and would be a complete book in itself. It is an option, however, and is available through the use of Qt frameworks.</p>

<p>This book is aimed at developers who are interested in developing cross-platform applications with Qt for use on mobile and embedded devices. Readers should have prior knowledge of C++ and be familiar, running commands from a command-line interface.</p>
