    These LEDs can indicate things such as power, receiving data, warnings or anything
    else that we may need visual feedback for. We have already seen how to use a basic,
    single-color LED but what if we need multiple LEDs or even multicolor LEDs? In
    this chapter, we will look at other ways to add LEDs to your project.

    Pixel Arduino shield**. Let's start off by learning about the RGB LED.

- en: A multicolor or RGB LED isn't really a single LED that can change color, it
    is actually three LEDs. An RGB LED contains three LEDs, which are red, green,
    and blue in color. The color that the LED produces is a combination of the colors
    produced by these three LEDs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are two types of RGB LEDs. These are the common anode and the common cathode
    LED. In a common cathode LED, the three LEDs share a common ground source, and
    in a common anode RGB LED, the three LEDs share a common power source.

    LEDs using the PWM pins on the Arduino. The light will then mix together, because
    the LEDs are so close, producing the color we want. Now let's look at what a WS2812
    integrated light source, or, as they are known on Adafruit's site, the **NeoPixel**.
    For most of this chapter, we will refer to the WS2812 integrated light source
    as a NeoPixel because it is shorter and also sounds cool.

- en: As you can imagine, if we wanted to include 10 RGB LEDs in a project, where
    each LED required three input pins, the project would very quickly turn into a
    wired mess. Not to mention we would quickly run out of pins on the Arduino as
    well. One of the ways that we can solve this problem is to use the NeoPixel. The
    NeoPixel integrates red, green and blue LEDs alongside a driver chip on a tiny
    surface-mounted package. This package can be controlled through a single wire
    and can be used individually or as a group. NeoPixel's come in many form factors
    including strips, rings, Arduino shields and even on jewelry.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One nice thing about the NeoPixel is there is no inherent limit to the number
    of NeoPixels that can be chained together. However, there are some practical limits
    based on the RAM and power constraints of the controller you are using.

    the `#ifdef` and the `#endif` statements; otherwise, skip that code. Therefore,
    if we define the `COMMON_ANODE` macro at the beginning of the code, then we subtract
    each parameter from `255` to get the correct intensity. We then use the `analogWrite()`
    function to write the values to the RGB pins.

    the intensity of each of the three RGB LEDs that are inside of the RGB LED. If
    we write the value of `255` to a common cathode LED, then the LED will be at its
    brightest. For a common anode LED, we will need to write a value of 0 to make
    the LED its brightest. That is why we subtracted the value of each parameter by
    `255` if the `COMMON_ANODE` macro is defined.
