<p>When considering this book, some of you will ask: <em class="italic">Another book on design patterns in C++? Why that, and why now? Hasn’t everything there is to know about design patterns been </em><em class="italic">written already?</em></p>
<p>There are several reasons why yet another book on <em class="italic">design</em> <em class="italic">patterns</em> has been written, but first of all, this is very much a C++ book—this is not a book on <em class="italic">design patterns </em>in C++ but a book on design patterns <em class="italic">in C++</em>, and the emphasis sets it apart. C++ has all the capabilities of a traditional object-oriented language, so all the classic object-oriented design patterns, such as Factory and Strategy, can be implemented in C++. A few of those are covered in this book. But the full power of C++ is realized when you utilize its generic programming capabilities. Remember that design patterns are frequently occurring design challenges and the commonly accepted solution—both sides are equally important in a pattern. It stands to reason that when new tools become available, new solutions become possible. Over time, the community settles on some of these solutions as the most advantageous overall, and a new variation of an old design pattern is born—the same challenge but a different preferred solution. But expanding capabilities also opens up new frontiers—with new tools at our disposal, new design challenges arise.</p>
<p>Others may expect to find a new coming of the classic book “<em class="italic">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</em>”. This ‘isn’t that book, and I do not believe that the time is right for such a book. The “<em class="italic">Gang of Four</em>” book was novel, even revolutionary, and it introduced the language of design patterns into the broad programming community. This has been done once and for all. It also established the neat taxonomy of design patterns, and that part has not aged nearly as well: as our pattern vocabulary expanded, we found patterns that do not fit easily into a particular category. We also extended the notion of design patterns beyond object-oriented programming and found that some of these patterns strongly resemble their object-oriented cousins while others are entirely new and different. Furthermore, in C++ and other languages with significantly different capabilities, a pattern that addresses the same need may look totally different. The bottom line is the original classification of patterns, while still useful, by now has more exceptions than typical examples, and the pattern landscape became too divergent for a new taxonomy that would not seem far too artificial. Maybe in time, as we develop the art further, new trends will emerge from the bird’s eye view of the expanded pattern landscape, but it has not happened yet.</p>
<p>This book has less ambitious but very practical goals. In this book, we focus on design patterns where C++ has something essential to add to at least one of the two sides of the pattern. On the one hand, we have patterns such as Visitor, where the generic programming capabilities of C++ allow for a better solution. That better solution was made possible by new features that were added with the evolution of the language from C++11 to C++17. On the other hand, generic programming is still programming (only the execution of the program happens at compile time); programming requires design, and design has common challenges that are not all that dissimilar to the challenges of traditional programming. Thus, many of the traditional patterns have their twins, or at least close siblings, in generic programming, and we largely focus on those patterns in this book. A prime example is the Strategy pattern, better known in the generic programming community by its alternative name, the Policy pattern. Also, as new features are added to the language, it can offer solutions to new problems or new solutions to old problems, and both of these eventually develop into design patterns. This is the case with the C++ coroutines, which make an appearance in the last chapter.</p>
<p>Finally, a language as complex as C++ is bound to have a few idiosyncrasies of its own that often lead to C++-specific challenges that have common, or <em class="italic">standard</em>, solutions. While not quite deserving of being called <em class="italic">patterns</em>, these C++-specific idioms are also covered in this book.</p>
<p>A few words about the changes for the second edition: first of all, there is a new chapter on patterns for concurrency. All examples are updated to use C++17 or C++20 wherever it makes sense, but never gratuitously. Many patterns, idioms, and examples demonstrating their use were updated with recent developments and advances – the result of the work of the C++ programming community in the last few years.</p>
<p>All that said, there are three main reasons why this book has been written:</p>
<ul>
<li>To cover C++-specific solutions for otherwise general, <em class="italic">classic </em>design patterns</li>
<li>To show C++-specific pattern variants that occur when old design challenges arise in the new domain of generic programming</li>
<li>To keep our patterns up to date with the language’s evolution</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is intended for C++ programmers who want to learn from <em class="italic">the wisdom of the community</em>—from commonly-recognized good solutions to frequently occurring design problems. Another way to put it is that this book is a way for a programmer to learn from someone else’s mistakes.</p>
<p>This is not a <em class="italic">learn</em> <em class="italic">C++</em> book; the target audience is mostly programmers who are reasonably familiar with the tools and the syntax of the language, and who are more interested in learning how and why these tools should be used. However, this book will also be useful for programmers wanting to learn more about C++, but wishing that their study could be guided by concrete and practical examples (for such programmers, we recommend having a C++ reference book close to hand as well). Finally, programmers who want to learn not just what’s new in C++17 or C++20, but what all these new features can be used for, will hopefully find this book illuminating as well.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
<p><a href="B19262_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a><em class="italic">, An Introduction to Inheritance and Polymorphism</em>, provides a brief overview of the object-oriented features of C++. This chapter is not intended as a reference for object-oriented programming in C++, but, rather, highlights the aspects of it that are important for the subsequent chapters.</p>
<p><a href="B19262_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor043"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a><em class="italic">, Class and Function Templates</em>, provides an overview of the generic programming facilities of C++—class templates, function templates, and lambda expressions. This chapter covers template instantiations and specializations, along with template function argument deduction and overload resolution, and prepares you for more complex uses of templates in later chapters.</p>
<p><a href="B19262_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor110"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a><em class="italic">, Memory and Ownership</em>, describes modern idiomatic ways of expressing different kinds of memory ownership in C++. This is a collection of conventions or idioms—the compiler does not enforce these rules, but programmers will find it easier to understand each other if they use the shared idiomatic vocabulary.</p>
<p><a href="B19262_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor152"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a><em class="italic">, Swap - From Simple to Subtle</em>, explores one of the most basic C++ operations, the swap, or exchange, of two values. This operation has surprisingly complex interactions with other C++ features that are discussed in the chapter.</p>
<p><a href="B19262_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor199"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a><em class="italic">, A Comprehensive Look at RAII</em>, explores in detail one of the fundamental concepts of C++, that of resource management, and introduces what may be the most popular C++ idiom, RAII, which is the standard C++ approach to managing resources.</p>
<p><a href="B19262_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor266"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a><em class="italic">, Understanding Type Erasure</em>, provides insight into a C++ technique that has been available in C++ for a long time but has grown in popularity and importance since the introduction of C++11. Type erasure allows the programmer to write abstract programs that do not explicitly mention certain types.</p>
<p><a href="B19262_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor314"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a><em class="italic">, SFINAE, Concepts, and Overload Resolution Management</em>, discusses SFINAE—a C++ idiom that is, on the one hand, essential to the use of templates in C++ and <em class="italic">just happens</em> transparently, while on the other hand, requires a very thorough and subtle understanding of C++ templates when used purposefully.</p>
<p><a href="B19262_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor360"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a><em class="italic">, The Curiously Recurring Template Pattern</em>, describes a <em class="italic">mind-wrapping </em>template-based pattern that combines the benefits of object-oriented programming with the flexibility of templates. The chapter explains the pattern and teaches you how to use it properly to solve practical problems. Lastly, this chapter prepares you for recognizing this pattern in later chapters.</p>
<p><a href="B19262_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor406"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a><em class="italic">, Named Arguments, Method Chaining, and the Builder Pattern</em>, covers an unusual technique for calling functions in C++, using named arguments instead of positional ones. This is another one of those idioms we use implicitly in every C++ program, but its explicit purposeful use takes some thought.</p>
<p><a href="B19262_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor453"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a><em class="italic">, Local Buffer Optimization</em>, is the only purely performance-oriented chapter in this book. Performance and efficiency are critical considerations that influence every design decision that affects the language itself—there is not a feature in the language that was not reviewed from the point of view of efficiency before being accepted into the standard. It is only fair that a chapter is dedicated to a common idiom used to improve the performance of C++ programs.</p>
<p><a href="B19262_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor509"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a><em class="italic">, ScopeGuard</em>, introduces an old C++ pattern that has changed almost beyond recognition with the recent versions of C++. The chapter teaches you about a pattern for easily writing exception-safe, or, more generally, error-safe code in C++.</p>
<p><a href="B19262_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor562"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a><em class="italic">, Friend Factory</em>, describes another old pattern that finds new uses in modern C++. This pattern is used to generate functions <em class="italic">associated</em> with templates, such as arithmetic operators for every type generated by a template.</p>
<p><a href="B19262_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor596"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a><em class="italic">, Virtual Constructors and Factories</em>, covers another classic object-oriented programming pattern as applied to C++, the Factory pattern. In the process, the chapter also shows you how to get the appearance of polymorphic behavior from C++ constructors, even though constructors cannot be virtual.</p>
<p><a href="B19262_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor640"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a><em class="italic">, The Template Method Pattern and the Non-Virtual Idiom</em>, describes an interesting crossover between a classic object-oriented pattern, the template, and a very C++-centric idiom. Together, they form a pattern that describes the optimal use of virtual functions in C++.</p>
<p><a href="B19262_15.xhtml#_idTextAnchor689"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></a><em class="italic">, Policy-Based Design</em>, covers one of the jewels of C++ design patterns, the Policy pattern (more commonly known as the Strategy pattern), applied at compile time, that is, as a generic programming pattern instead of an object-oriented pattern.</p>
<p><a href="B19262_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor739"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a><em class="italic">, Adapters and Decorators</em>, discusses the two very broad and closely related patterns as they apply to C++. The chapter considers the use of these patterns in object-oriented designs, as well as in generic programs.</p>
<p><a href="B19262_17.xhtml#_idTextAnchor783"><em class="italic">Chapter 17</em></a><em class="italic">, The Visitor Pattern and Multiple Dispatch</em>, rounds off our gallery of classic object-oriented programming patterns with the perennially popular Visitor pattern. The chapter explains the pattern itself, then focuses on the ways that modern C++ makes the implementation of Visitor simpler, more robust, and less error-prone.</p>
<p><a href="B19262_18.xhtml#_idTextAnchor832"><em class="italic">Chapter 18</em></a><em class="italic">, Patterns for Concurrency</em>, is a new addition to the book. While C++ has been used to write concurrent programs long before C++11 gave us the “official” tools for it, the wide range of problem-specific solutions makes identifying common patterns difficult. This chapter introduces the patterns that became the basic building blocks for designing concurrent software in C++.</p>

<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-14"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"/>Part 1: Getting Started with C++ Features and Concepts</h1>
<p>This part introduces and explains the features of C++ object-oriented programming, generic programming, and some of the other advanced language tools that are necessary for you to understand the rest of the book. We also discuss some of the more annoying limitations imposed by the language: many of the patterns we show in the later chapters are nothing but universally recognized solutions to these limitations. This is not meant as a complete guide for any of the features, but helps make the book more self-contained as a hands-on guide for programmers. This part has the following chapters:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="B19262_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">An Introduction to Inheritance and Polymorphism</em></li>
