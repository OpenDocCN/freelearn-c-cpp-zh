- en: In this section, you will delve into various low-level details of LLVM. Firstly,
    you will explore the TableGen language, which is LLVMâ€™s domain-specific language,
    and understand how it can be utilized in the backend. LLVM also has a **just-in-time**
    (**JIT**) compiler, and you will explore how to use it and tailor it to your needs.
    Furthermore, you will also try out various tools and libraries designed to identify
    bugs in applications. With all of this in mind, this knowledge will empower you
    to take advantage of new architectures not yet supported by LLVM.
