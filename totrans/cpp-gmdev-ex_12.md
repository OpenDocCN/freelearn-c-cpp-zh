# Section 4: Rendering 3D Objects with Vulkan

Using the knowledge of 3D graphics programming that we gained in the previous section, we can now build on it to develop a basic project with Vulkan. OpenGL is a high-level graphics library. There are a lot things that OpenGL does in the background that the user is generally not aware of. With Vulkan, we will see the inner workings of a graphics library. We will see the why and the how of creating SwapChains, image views, renderpasses, Framebuffers, command buffers, as well as rendering and presenting objects to a scene.
