# Section 4: Advanced RTOS Techniques

By building on concepts from the previous section, you'll learn how to get the absolute best real-time performance using both hardware acceleration and firmware techniques. After taking a deep dive into efficient driver implementation, you'll learn how to architect a robust and testable code base that will be a pleasure to work with and transcend multiple hardware designs. Learn what higher-level considerations you should be aware of, such as various options in RTOS APIs and the number of cores or processors you can design into a system. Finally, you'll pick up a few troubleshooting tips and suggested next steps.
