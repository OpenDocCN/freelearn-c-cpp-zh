<h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>Introduction to Unreal Engine</h1>
<p><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>Welcome to <em class="italic">Game Development Projects with Unreal Engine Second Edition</em>. If this is the first time you’re using <strong class="bold">Unreal Engine 5</strong> (<strong class="bold">UE5</strong>), this book will support you in getting started with one of the most in-demand game engines on the market. You will discover how to build up your game development skills and how to express yourself by creating video games. If you’ve already tried using UE5, this book will help you develop your knowledge and skills further so that you can build games more easily and effectively.</p>
<p>A game engine is a software application that allows you to produce video games from the ground up. Their feature sets vary significantly but usually allow you to import multimedia files, such as 3D models, images, audio, and video, and manipulate those files through the use of programming, where you can use programming languages such as C++, Python, and Lua, among others.</p>
<p>UE5 uses two main programming languages, C++ and Blueprint, with the latter being a visual scripting language that allows you to do most of what C++ also allows. Although we will be teaching a bit of Blueprint in this book, we will mostly focus on C++, and hence expect you to have a basic understanding of the language, including topics such as <strong class="bold">variables</strong>, <strong class="bold">functions</strong>, <strong class="bold">classes</strong>, <strong class="bold">inheritance</strong>, and <strong class="bold">polymorphism</strong>. We will remind you about these topics throughout this book where appropriate.</p>
<p>Examples of popular video games made with Unreal Engine 4, the previous Unreal Engine version that UE5 is heavily based on, include <em class="italic">Fortnite</em>, <em class="italic">Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, <em class="italic">Borderlands 3</em>, <em class="italic">Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order</em>, <em class="italic">Gears 5</em>, and <em class="italic">Sea of Thieves</em>, among many others. All of these have a very high level of visual fidelity, are well-known, and have (or had) millions of players.</p>
<p>The following link specifies some of the great games that have been made with Unreal Engine 5: <a href="https://youtu.be/kT4iWCxu5hA"> https://youtu.be/kT4iWCxu5hA</a>. This showcase will show you the variety of games that UE5 allows you to make, both in terms of visuals and gameplay style.</p>
<p>If you’d like to make games such as the ones shown in the video one day or contribute to them in any way, then you’ve taken your first step in that direction.</p>
<p>This chapter will be an introduction to the Unreal Engine editor. You will learn about the editor’s interface; how to add, remove, and manipulate objects in a level; how to use Unreal Engine’s Blueprint visual scripting language; and how to use materials in combination with meshes.</p>
<p>By the end of this chapter, you will be able to navigate the Unreal Engine editor, create Actors, manipulate them inside the level, and create materials. Let’s start this chapter by learning how to create a new UE5 project in this first exercise.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">Before you continue this chapter, make sure you have installed all the necessary software mentioned in the <em class="italic">Preface</em>.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p>The code files for this chapter can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Elevating-Game-Experiences-with-Unreal-Engine-5-Second-Edition">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Elevating-Game-Experiences-with-Unreal-Engine-5-Second-Edition</a></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>Exercise 1.01 – creating an Unreal Engine 5 project</h1>
<p>In this first exercise, we will learn <a id="_idIndexMarker000"/><a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>how to create a new UE5 project. UE5 has predefined project templates that allow you to implement a basic setup for your project.  We’ll be using the <strong class="bold">Third Person</strong> template project in this exercise.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to complete this exercise:</p>
<ol>
<li>After installing Unreal Engine version 5.0, launch the editor by clicking the <strong class="bold">Launch</strong> button next to the version icon.</li>
<li>After you’ve done that, you’ll be greeted with the engine’s <strong class="bold">Projects</strong> window, which will show you the existing projects that you can open and work on. It will also give you the option to create a new project. Because we have no projects yet, the <strong class="bold">Recent Projects</strong> section will be empty. To create a new project, choose a <strong class="bold">Project Category</strong> option, which in our case will be <strong class="bold">Games</strong>. Then, click <strong class="bold">Next</strong>.</li>
<li>After that, you’ll see the <strong class="bold">Project Templates</strong> window. This window will show all the available project templates in Unreal Engine. When creating a new project, instead of having that project start empty, you have the option to add some assets and code out of the box, which you can then modify to your liking. There are several project templates available for different types of games, but we’ll want to go with the <strong class="bold">Third Person</strong> project template in this case. </li>
<li>Select that template and click the <strong class="bold">Next</strong> button, which should take you to the <strong class="bold">Project Settings</strong> window.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this window, you can choose a few options related to your project:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Blueprint or C++</strong>: Here, you can choose whether you want to be able to add C++ classes. The default option is <strong class="bold">Blueprint</strong>, but in our case, we’ll want to select the <strong class="bold">C++</strong> option.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Quality</strong>: Here, you can choose whether you want your project to have high-quality graphics or high performance. Set this option to <strong class="bold">Maximum Quality</strong>.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Raytracing</strong>: Here, you can choose whether you want raytracing enabled or disabled. Raytracing is a novel graphics rendering technique that allows you to render objects by simulating the path of light (using light rays) over a digital environment. Although this technique is rather costly in terms of performance, it also <a id="_idIndexMarker002"/><a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>provides much more realistic graphics, especially when it comes to lighting. Set it to <strong class="bold">disabled</strong>.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Target Platforms</strong>: Here, you can choose the main platforms you’ll want this project to run on. Set this option to <strong class="bold">Desktop/Console</strong>.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Starter Content</strong>: Here, you can choose whether you want this project to come with an additional set of basic assets. Set this option to <strong class="bold">With Starter Content</strong>.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Location and Name</strong>: At the bottom of the window, you’ll be able to choose the location where your project will be stored on your computer and its name.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li value="5">Once you’ve made sure that all the options have been set to their intended values, click the <strong class="bold">Create Project</strong> button. This will cause your project to be created according to the parameters you set. It may take a few minutes for it to be ready. With that, you have created your first UE5 project!</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, let’s learn about some of the basics of UE5.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Getting to know Unreal Engine</h1>
<p>In this section, you will be introduced to the <a id="_idIndexMarker004"/><a id="_idIndexMarker005"/>Unreal Engine editor, which is a fundamental topic for becoming familiar with UE5.</p>
<p>Once your project has been generated, you should see the Unreal Engine editor open automatically. This screen is likely the one that you will see the most when working with Unreal Engine, so you must get accustomed to it.</p>
<p>Let’s break down what we can see in the editor window:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.1 – The Unreal Engine editor divided into its main windows " height="894" src="img/Figure_1.01_B18531.jpg" width="1650"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.1 – The Unreal Engine editor divided into its main windows</p>
<p>Let’s look at these windows in <a id="_idIndexMarker006"/><a id="_idIndexMarker007"/>more detail:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1"><strong class="bold">Viewport</strong>: At the very center of the screen, you can see the <strong class="bold">Viewport</strong> window. This will show you the content of the current level and will allow you to navigate through your level as well as add, move, remove, and edit objects inside it. It also contains several different parameters regarding visual filters, object filters (which objects you can see), and the lighting on your level.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Outliner</strong>: At the top-right corner of the screen, you’ll see the <strong class="bold">Outliner</strong> window. This allows you to quickly list and manipulate the objects that are on your level. The <strong class="bold">Viewport</strong> and <strong class="bold">Outliner</strong> windows work hand in hand in allowing you to manage your level, where the former will show you what it looks like and the latter will help you manage and organize it. The <strong class="bold">Outliner</strong> window allows you to organize the objects in your level in directories by showing you the <em class="italic">objects</em> in your level.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Details</strong>: At the far right of the screen, below <strong class="bold">Outliner</strong>, you’ll be able to see the <strong class="bold">Details</strong> panel, which allows you to edit the properties of an object that you have selected in your level. Since no objects have been selected in the preceding screenshot, it is empty. However, if you select any object in your level by <em class="italic">left-clicking</em> on it, its properties should appear in this window, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.2 – The Details tab " height="648" src="img/Figure_1.02_B18531.jpg" width="389"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.2 – The Details tab</p>
<ol>
<li value="4"><strong class="bold">Toolbar</strong>: At the top of the<a id="_idIndexMarker008"/><a id="_idIndexMarker009"/> screen, you’ll see the <strong class="bold">Toolbar</strong> area, where you’ll be able to save your current level, add objects to your level, and play your level, among other things.</li>
</ol>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">We will only be using some of the buttons from these toolbars, namely, the <strong class="bold">Save Current</strong>, <strong class="bold">Settings</strong>, <strong class="bold">Add</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Play</strong> buttons.</p>
<ol>
<li value="5"><strong class="bold">Content Drawer</strong>: One of the windows that you’ll be using very frequently is the <strong class="bold">Content Drawer</strong> window. This window lets you quickly access the <strong class="bold">Context Browser</strong> window. You can also open it by using <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">Space</em>. The <strong class="bold">Content Browser</strong> window will let you browse and manipulate all the files and assets located inside your project’s folder. As mentioned at the start of this chapter, Unreal Engine allows you to<a id="_idIndexMarker010"/><a id="_idIndexMarker011"/> import several types of multimedia files, and <strong class="bold">Content Browser</strong> is the window that will allow you to browse and edit them in their respective sub-editors. Whenever you create an Unreal Engine project, it will <a id="_idIndexMarker012"/><a id="_idIndexMarker013"/>always generate a <strong class="bold">Content</strong> folder. This folder will be the <strong class="bold">root directory</strong> of the <strong class="bold">Content Browser</strong> window, meaning you can only browse files inside that folder. You can see the directory you’re currently browsing inside the <strong class="bold">Content Browser</strong> window by looking at the top of it, which, in our case, is <strong class="bold">Content</strong> | <strong class="bold">ThirdPersonCPP</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.3 – The Content Browser window shown in Unreal Editor interface" height="894" src="img/Figure_1.03_B18531.jpg" width="1650"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.3 – The Content Browser window shown in Unreal Editor interface</p>
<p>If you click the icon to the left of the <strong class="bold">Filters</strong> button, at the very left of the <strong class="bold">Content Browser</strong> window, you will be able to see the directory hierarchy of the <strong class="bold">Content</strong> folder. This directory view allows you to select, expand, and collapse individual directories in the <strong class="bold">Content</strong> folder of your project:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.4 – The Content Browser window’s directory view " height="391" src="img/Figure_1.04_B18531.jpg" width="834"/>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.4 – The Content Browser window’s directory view</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">The terms <strong class="bold">Content Drawer</strong> and <strong class="bold">Content Browser</strong> are interchangeable.</p>
<p>Now that we have learned <a id="_idIndexMarker014"/><a id="_idIndexMarker015"/>about the main windows of the Unreal Engine editor, let’s look at how to manage those windows (hiding and showing their tabs).</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>Exploring editor windows</h1>
<p>As we’ve seen, the Unreal Engine editor is<a id="_idIndexMarker016"/><a id="_idIndexMarker017"/> comprised of many windows, all of which are resizable, movable, and have a corresponding tab on top of them. You can <em class="italic">click and hold</em> a window’s tab and drag it to move it somewhere else. You can hide tab labels by <em class="italic">right-clicking</em> them and selecting the <strong class="bold">Hide Tabs</strong> option:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.5 – How to hide a tab" height="267" src="img/Figure_1.05_B18531.jpg" width="391"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.5 – How to hide a tab</p>
<p>If the tab labels have been hidden, you can get them to reappear by clicking the <em class="italic">blue triangle</em> in the top-left corner of that window, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.6 – The blue triangle that allows you to show a window’s tab" height="157" src="img/Figure_1.06_B18531.jpg" width="242"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.6 – The blue triangle that allows you to show a window’s tab</p>
<p>You can also dock the windows to the sidebar to hide them while also having them easily available:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.7 – Docking a window to the sidebar " height="237" src="img/Figure_1.07_B18531.jpg" width="537"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.7 – Docking a window to the sidebar</p>
<p>After that, to show or hide them, you <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/><a id="_idIndexMarker019"/>simply have to click them:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.8 – Showing a window docked to the sidebar " height="1283" src="img/Figure_1.08_B18531.jpg" width="1054"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.8 – Showing a window docked to the sidebar</p>
<p>When it comes to the windows that are docked to the lower bar, such as the <strong class="bold">Content Drawer</strong> window, you can undock them from the lower bar into the editor by clicking <strong class="bold">Dock in Layout</strong> in the top-right corner:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.9 – Undocking a window from the lower bar in the editor " height="82" src="img/Figure_1.09_B18531.jpg" width="490"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.9 – Undocking a window from the lower bar in the editor</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you can browse <a id="_idIndexMarker020"/><a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>and open all the windows available in the editor, including the ones that were just mentioned, by clicking the <strong class="bold">Window</strong> button in the top-left corner of the editor.</p>
<p>Another very important thing you should know is how to play your level from inside the editor (also known as <strong class="bold">PIE</strong>). At the right <a id="_idIndexMarker022"/><a id="_idIndexMarker023"/>edge of the <strong class="bold">Toolbar</strong> window, you’ll see the green <strong class="bold">Play</strong> button. If you click it, you’ll start playing the currently open level inside the editor:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.10 – The green play button, alongside other game playback buttons " height="41" src="img/Figure_1.10_B18531.jpg" width="158"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.10 – The green play button, alongside other game playback buttons</p>
<p>Once you hit <strong class="bold">Play</strong>, you’ll be able to control the player character in the level by using the <em class="italic">W</em>, <em class="italic">A</em>, <em class="italic">S</em>, and <em class="italic">D</em> keys to move the player character, the <em class="italic">Spacebar</em> to jump, and moving your mouse to rotate the camera:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.11 – The level being played inside the editor" height="595" src="img/Figure_1.11_B18531.jpg" width="1100"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.11 – The level being played inside the editor</p>
<p>Then, you can press the <em class="italic">Shift</em> + <em class="italic">Esc</em> keys to stop playing the level.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve gotten accustomed to <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/><a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>some of the editor’s windows, let’s take a deeper look at the <strong class="bold">Viewport</strong> window’s navigation.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Viewport navigation</h1>
<p>In the previous section, we mentioned<a id="_idIndexMarker026"/><a id="_idIndexMarker027"/> that the <strong class="bold">Viewport</strong> window allows you to visualize your level, as well as manipulate the objects inside it. Because this is a very important window for you to use and has a lot of functionality, we’re going to learn more about it in this section.</p>
<p>Before we start learning about the <strong class="bold">Viewport</strong> window, let’s quickly get to<a id="_idIndexMarker028"/><a id="_idIndexMarker029"/> know <strong class="bold">levels</strong>. In UE5, levels represent a <strong class="bold">collection of objects</strong>, as well as <a id="_idIndexMarker030"/><a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>their locations and properties. The <strong class="bold">Viewport</strong> window will always show you the contents of the currently selected level, which in this case was already made and generated alongside the <strong class="bold">Third Person</strong> template project. In this level, you can see four wall objects, one ground object, a set of stairs, and some other elevated objects, as well as the player character, which is represented by the UE5 mannequin. You can create multiple levels and switch between them by opening them via the <strong class="bold">Content Browser</strong> window.</p>
<p>To manipulate and navigate the currently selected level, you must use the <strong class="bold">Viewport</strong> window. If you press and hold the <em class="italic">left mouse button</em> inside the window, you’ll be able to rotate the camera horizontally by moving the mouse <em class="italic">left</em> and <em class="italic">right</em>, and move the camera forward and backward by moving the mouse <em class="italic">forward</em> and <em class="italic">backward</em>. You can achieve similar results by holding the <em class="italic">right mouse button</em>, except the camera will rotate vertically when you move the mouse <em class="italic">forward</em> and <em class="italic">backward</em>, which allows you to rotate the camera both horizontally and vertically.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can move around the level by clicking and holding the <strong class="bold">Viewport</strong> window with the <em class="italic">right mouse button</em> (the <em class="italic">left mouse button</em> works too, but using it for movement is not as useful due to there not being as much freedom when rotating the camera) and using the <em class="italic">W</em> and <em class="italic">S</em> keys to move forward and backward, the <em class="italic">A</em> and <em class="italic">D</em> keys to move sideways, and the <em class="italic">E</em> and <em class="italic">Q</em> keys to move up and down.</p>
<p>If you look at the top-right corner of the <strong class="bold">Viewport</strong> window, you will see a small camera icon with a number next to it, which will allow you to change the speed at which the camera moves in the <strong class="bold">Viewport</strong> window.</p>
<p>Another thing you can do in the <strong class="bold">Viewport</strong> window is change its visualization settings. You can change the type of visualization in the <strong class="bold">Viewport</strong> window by clicking the button that currently says <strong class="bold">Lit</strong>, which will show you all the options available for different lighting and other types of visualization filters.</p>
<p>If you click on the <strong class="bold">Perspective</strong> button, you’ll have the option to switch between seeing your level from a perspective view, as well as from an orthographic view, the latter of which may help you build your levels faster.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve learned how to navigate the viewport, let’s learn how to manipulate objects, also known as Actors, in your level.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Manipulating Actors</h1>
<p>In Unreal Engine, all the objects that can be <a id="_idIndexMarker032"/><a id="_idIndexMarker033"/>placed in a level are referred to as Actors. In a movie, an actor would be a human playing a character, but in UE5, every single object you see in your level, including walls, floors, weapons, and characters, is an Actor.</p>
<p>Every Actor must have what’s called a <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> property, which is a collection of three things: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>Vector</code> property signifying the <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/><a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>position of that Actor in the level in the <em class="italic">X</em>, <em class="italic">Y,</em> and <em class="italic">Z</em>-axis. A vector is simply a tuple with three floating-point numbers – one for the location of the point on each axis.</li>
<li><code>Rotator</code> property signifying the <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/><a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>rotation of that Actor along the <em class="italic">X</em>, <em class="italic">Y,</em> and <em class="italic">Z</em>-axis. A rotator is also a tuple with three floating-point numbers – one for the angle of rotation on each axis.</li>
<li><code>Vector</code> property <a id="_idIndexMarker038"/><a id="_idIndexMarker039"/>signifying the scale (that is, the size) of that Actor in the level in the <em class="italic">X</em>, <em class="italic">Y,</em> and <em class="italic">Z</em>-axis. This is also a collection of three floating-point numbers – one for the scale value on each axis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Actors can be moved, rotated, and scaled in a level, which will modify their <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> property accordingly. To do this, select any object in your level by <em class="italic">left-clicking</em> on it. You should see the <strong class="bold">Move</strong> tool appear:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.12 – The Move tool, which allows you to move an Actor in the level  " height="267" src="img/Figure_1.12_B18531.jpg" width="245"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.12 – The Move tool, which allows you to move an Actor in the level </p>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Move</strong> tool is a three-axis gizmo<a id="_idIndexMarker040"/><a id="_idIndexMarker041"/> that allows you to move an object in any of the axes simultaneously. The red arrow of the <strong class="bold">Move</strong> tool (pointing to the left in the preceding screenshot) represents the <em class="italic">X</em>-axis, the green arrow (pointing to the right in the preceding screenshot) represents the <em class="italic">Y</em>-axis, and the blue arrow (pointing up in the preceding screenshot) represents the <em class="italic">Z</em>-axis. If you <em class="italic">click and hold</em> any of these arrows and then drag them <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/><a id="_idIndexMarker043"/>around the level, you will move your Actor along that axis in the level. If you click the handles that connect two arrows, you will move the Actor along both those axes simultaneously, and if you click the white sphere at the intersection of all the arrows, you will move the Actor freely along all three axes:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.13 – An Actor being moved on the Z-axis using the Move tool " height="715" src="img/Figure_1.13_B18531.jpg" width="1177"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.13 – An Actor being moved on the Z-axis using the Move tool</p>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Move</strong> tool allows you to move an <a id="_idIndexMarker044"/><a id="_idIndexMarker045"/>Actor around the level, but if you want to rotate or scale an Actor, you’ll need to use the <strong class="bold">Rotate</strong> and <strong class="bold">Scale</strong> tools, respectively. You can switch between the <strong class="bold">Move</strong>, <strong class="bold">Rotate</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Scale</strong> tools by pressing the <em class="italic">W</em>, <em class="italic">E</em>, and <em class="italic">R</em> keys, respectively. Press <em class="italic">E</em> to switch to the <strong class="bold">Rotate</strong> tool:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.14 – The Rotate tool, which allows you to rotate an Actor " height="290" src="img/Figure_1.14_B18531.jpg" width="303"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.14 – The Rotate tool, which allows you to rotate an Actor</p>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Rotate</strong> tool, as expected, allows you to <a id="_idIndexMarker046"/><a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>rotate an Actor in your level. You can <em class="italic">click and hold</em> any of the arcs to rotate the Actor around its associated axis. The red arc (top left in the preceding screenshot) will rotate the Actor around the <em class="italic">X</em>-axis, the <a id="_idIndexMarker048"/><a id="_idIndexMarker049"/>green arc (top right in the preceding screenshot) will rotate the Actor around the <em class="italic">Y</em>-axis, and the blue arc (lower center in the preceding screenshot) will rotate the Actor around the <em class="italic">Z</em>-axis:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.15 – A cube before and after being rotated 30 degrees around the Y-axis  " height="406" src="img/Figure_1.15_B18531.jpg" width="1450"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.15 – A cube before and after being rotated 30 degrees around the Y-axis </p>
<p>Keep in mind that an object’s rotation around the <em class="italic">X</em>-axis is usually designated as <strong class="bold">Roll</strong>, its rotation around the <em class="italic">Y</em>-axis is usually designated as <strong class="bold">Pitch</strong>, and its rotation around the <em class="italic">Z</em>-axis is usually designated as <strong class="bold">Yaw</strong>.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have the <strong class="bold">Scale</strong> tool. Press <em class="italic">R</em> to switch to it:</p>

<p>Now that you know how to manipulate Actors already present in your level, let’s learn how to add and remove Actors to and from our level.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Exercise 1.02 – adding and removing Actors</h2>
<p>In this exercise, we will be <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/><a id="_idIndexMarker055"/>adding and removing Actors from our level.</p>
<p>When it comes to adding Actors to your level, there are two main ways in which you can do so: by dragging assets from the <strong class="bold">Content Browser</strong> window or by dragging the default assets from the <strong class="bold">Modes</strong> window’s <strong class="bold">Place Mode</strong>.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to complete this exercise:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Go to the <code>ThirdPersonCharacter</code> Actor. If you drag that asset to your level using the <em class="italic">left mouse button</em>, you will be able to add an instance of that Actor to it. It will be placed wherever you let go of the <em class="italic">left mouse button</em>:</li>

<p class="callout">Although we won’t be covering this topic in this book, one of the ways developers can populate their levels with simple boxes and geometry, for prototyping purposes, is BSP Brushes. These can be quickly molded into the desired shape as you build your levels.

<p>And with this, we have concluded this exercise and learned how to add and remove Actors to and from our level.</p>
<p>Now that we know how to navigate the <strong class="bold">Viewport</strong> window, let’s learn about Blueprint Actors.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>Understanding Blueprint Actors</h1>
<p>In UE5, the word Blueprint <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/><a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>can be used to refer to two different things: UE5’s visual scripting language or a specific type of asset, also referred to as a Blueprint class or Blueprint asset.</p>
<p>As we’ve mentioned previously, an Actor is an object that can be placed in a level. This object can either be an instance of a C++ class or an instance of a Blueprint class, both of which must inherit from the Actor class (either directly or indirectly). So, what is the difference between a C++ class and a Blueprint class, you may ask? There are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you add programming logic to your C++ class, you’ll have access to more advanced engine functionality than you <a id="_idIndexMarker060"/><a id="_idIndexMarker061"/>would if you were to create a Blueprint class.</li>
<li>In a Blueprint class, you can easily view and edit visual components of that class, such as a 3D mesh or a Trigger Box Collision, as well as modify properties defined in the C++ class that are exposed to the editor, which makes managing those properties much easier.</li>
<li>In a Blueprint class, you can easily reference other assets in your project, whereas in C++, you can also do so but less simply and less flexibly.</li>
<li>Programming logic that runs on Blueprint visual scripting is slower in terms of performance than that of a C++ class.</li>
<li>It’s simple to have more than one person work on a C++ class simultaneously without conflicts in a source version platform, whereas with a Blueprint class, which is interpreted as a binary file instead of a text file, conflicts will occur in your source version platform if two different people edit the same Blueprint class.</li>
</ul>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">If you don’t know what a source version platform is, this is how several developers can work on the same project and have it updated with the work done by other developers. In these platforms, different people can usually edit the same file simultaneously, so long as they edit different parts of that file, and still receive updates that other programmers made without them affecting your work on that same file. One of the most popular source version platforms is GitHub.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Blueprint classes<a id="_idIndexMarker062"/><a id="_idIndexMarker063"/> can inherit either from a C++ class or from another Blueprint class.</p>
<p>Lastly, before we create our first Blueprint class, another important thing you should know is that you can write programming logic in a C++ class and then create a Blueprint class that inherits from that class, but can also access its properties and methods if you specify that in the C++ class. You can have a Blueprint class edit properties defined in the C++ class, as well as call and override functions using the Blueprint scripting language. We will be doing some of these things in this book.</p>
<p>Now that you know a bit more about Blueprint classes, let’s create our own.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>Exercise 1.03 – creating Blueprint Actors</h2>
<p>In this short exercise, we will learn how to <a id="_idIndexMarker064"/><a id="_idIndexMarker065"/>create a new Blueprint Actor.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to complete this exercise:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Go to the <strong class="bold">ThirdPersonCPP</strong> | <strong class="bold">Blueprints</strong> directory<a id="_idIndexMarker066"/><a id="_idIndexMarker067"/> inside the <strong class="bold">Content Browser</strong> window and <em class="italic">right-click</em> inside it. The following window should pop up:</li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.22 – The options window inside the Content Browser window " height="753" src="img/Figure_1.22_B18531.jpg" width="323"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.22 – The options window inside the Content Browser window</p>
<p>This options menu contains the types of assets that you can create in UE5 (Blueprints are simply a type of asset, along with other types of assets, such as <strong class="bold">Level</strong>, <strong class="bold">Material</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Sound</strong>).</p>
<ol>
<li value="2">Click on the <strong class="bold">Blueprint Class</strong> icon to create a new Blueprint class. When you do, you will be given the option to choose the C++ or Blueprint class that you want to inherit from:</li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.23 – The Pick Parent Class window that pops up when you create a new Blueprint class " height="444" src="img/Figure_1.23_B18531.jpg" width="624"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.23 – The Pick Parent Class window that pops up when you create a new Blueprint class</p>
<ol>
<li value="3">Select the first class from this<a id="_idIndexMarker068"/><a id="_idIndexMarker069"/> window – that is, the <code>Actor</code> class. After this, the text of the new Blueprint class will be automatically selected so that you can easily name it what you want. Name this Blueprint class <code>TestActor</code> and press the <em class="italic">Enter</em> key to accept this name.</li>
</ol>
<p>After following these steps, you will have created your Blueprint class and completed this exercise. Once you’ve created this asset, double-click on it with the <em class="italic">left mouse button</em> to open the Blueprint editor. We will learn more about this in the next section.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>Exploring the Blueprint editor</h1>
<p>The Blueprint editor is a sub-editor <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/><a id="_idIndexMarker071"/>within the Unreal Engine editor specifically for Blueprint classes. Here, you can edit the properties and logic for your Blueprint classes, or those of their parent classes, as well as their visual appearance.</p>
<p>When you open an Actor Blueprint class, you should see the Blueprint editor. This window will allow you to edit your Blueprint classes in UE5. Let’s learn about the windows that you’re currently seeing:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.24 – The Blueprint editor window is broken down into five parts " height="927" src="img/Figure_1.24_B18531.jpg" width="1650"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.24 – The Blueprint editor window is broken down into five parts</p>
<p>Let’s look at these windows in more detail:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1"><strong class="bold">Viewport</strong>: Front and center in the<a id="_idIndexMarker072"/><a id="_idIndexMarker073"/> editor, you have the <strong class="bold">Viewport</strong> window. This window, similar to the <strong class="bold">Level Viewport</strong> window that we already learned about, will allow you to visualize your Actor and edit its components. Every Actor can have several Actor Components, some of which have a visual representation, such as Mesh Components and Collision Components. We’ll talk about Actor Components in more depth later in this book.</li>
</ol>
<p>Technically, this center window contains three tabs, only one of which is the <strong class="bold">Viewport</strong> window, but we’ll be talking about the other important tab, <strong class="bold">Event Graph</strong>, after we tackle this editor’s interface. The third tab is the <strong class="bold">Construction Script</strong> window, which will not be covered in this book.</p>
<ol>
<li value="2"><strong class="bold">Components</strong>: At the top left of the editor, you have the <strong class="bold">Components</strong> window. As mentioned previously, Actors can have several Actor Components, and this window is the one that will allow you to add and remove those Actor Components in your Blueprint class, as well as access the Actor Components defined in the C++ classes it inherits from.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">My Blueprint</strong>: At the bottom left of the editor, you have the <strong class="bold">My Blueprint</strong> window. This will allow you to browse, add, and remove variables and functions defined in both this Blueprint class and the C++ class it inherits from. Keep in mind that Blueprints have a special kind of function, called an <strong class="bold">event</strong>, which is used to represent an event that happened in the game. You should see three of them in this window: <strong class="bold">BeginPlay</strong>, <strong class="bold">ActorBeginOverlap</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Tick</strong>. We’ll be talking about these shortly.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Details</strong>: At the right of the editor, you have the <strong class="bold">Details</strong> window. Similar to the editor’s <strong class="bold">Details</strong> window, this window will show you the properties of the currently selected Actor Component, function, variable, event, or any other individual element of this Blueprint class. If you currently have no elements selected, this window will be empty.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Toolbar</strong>: At the top center of the editor, you have the <strong class="bold">Toolbar</strong> window. This window will allow you to compile the code you wrote in this Blueprint class, save it, locate it in the <strong class="bold">Content Browser</strong> window, and access this class’s settings, among other things.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can see the parent class of a <a id="_idIndexMarker074"/><a id="_idIndexMarker075"/>Blueprint class by looking at the top-right corner of the Blueprint editor. If you click the name of the parent class, you’ll be taken to either the corresponding Blueprint class, through the Unreal Engine editor, or the C++ class, through Visual Studio.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can change a Blueprint class’s parent class by clicking on the <strong class="bold">File</strong> tab at the top left of the Blueprint editor and selecting the <strong class="bold">Reparent Blueprint</strong> option, which will allow you to specify the new parent class of this Blueprint class.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve learned about the basics of the Blueprint editor, let’s look at its <strong class="bold">Event Graph</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>Exploring the Event Graph window</h1>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Event Graph</strong> window is where <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/><a id="_idIndexMarker077"/>you’ll be writing all of your Blueprint visual scripting code, creating your variables and functions, and accessing other variables and functions declared in this class’s parent class.</p>
<p>If you select the <strong class="bold">Event Graph</strong> tab, which you should be able to see to the right of the <strong class="bold">Viewport</strong> tab, you will be shown the <strong class="bold">Event Graph</strong> window instead of the <strong class="bold">Viewport</strong> window. On clicking the <strong class="bold">Event Graph</strong> tab, you will see the following window:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.25 – The Event Graph window, showing three disabled events " height="793" src="img/Figure_1.25_B18531.jpg" width="693"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.25 – The Event Graph window, showing three disabled events</p>
<p>You can navigate the <strong class="bold">Event Graph</strong> window<a id="_idIndexMarker078"/><a id="_idIndexMarker079"/> by holding the <em class="italic">right mouse button</em> and dragging inside the graph, you can zoom in and out by scrolling the <em class="italic">mouse wheel</em>, and you can select nodes from the graph by either clicking the <em class="italic">left mouse button</em> or by clicking and holding to select an area of nodes.</p>
<p>You can also <em class="italic">right-click</em> inside the <strong class="bold">Event Graph</strong> window to access the Blueprint’s <strong class="bold">Actions</strong> menu, which allows you to access the actions you can perform in the <strong class="bold">Event Graph</strong> window, including getting and setting variables, calling functions or events, and many others.</p>
<p>The way scripting works in Blueprint is by connecting nodes using pins. There are several types of nodes, such as variables, functions, and<a id="_idIndexMarker080"/><a id="_idIndexMarker081"/> events. You can connect these nodes through pins, of which there are two types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Execution pins</strong>: These will dictate the order<a id="_idIndexMarker082"/><a id="_idIndexMarker083"/> in which the nodes will be executed. If you want node 1 to be executed first and then node 2, you can link the output execution pin of node 1 to the input execution pin of node 2, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ul>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.26 – Blueprint execution pins " height="127" src="img/Figure_1.26_B18531.jpg" width="429"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.26 – Blueprint execution pins</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Variable pins</strong>: These work as <a id="_idIndexMarker084"/><a id="_idIndexMarker085"/>parameters (also known as input pins), at the left of the node, and return values (also known as output pins), at the right of the node, representing a value of a certain type (integer, float, Boolean, and others):</li>
</ul>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.27 – The Get Scalar Parameter Value node " height="180" src="img/Figure_1.27_B18531.jpg" width="331"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.27 – The Get Scalar Parameter Value node</p>
<p>Let’s understand this better by completing an exercise.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Exercise 1.04 – creating Blueprint variables</h2>
<p>In this exercise, we will learn <a id="_idIndexMarker086"/><a id="_idIndexMarker087"/>how to create Blueprint variables by creating a new variable of the <strong class="bold">Boolean</strong> type.</p>
<p>In Blueprint, variables work similarly to the ones you would use in C++. You can create them, get their value, and set them.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to complete this exercise:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">To create a new Blueprint variable, head to<a id="_idIndexMarker088"/><a id="_idIndexMarker089"/> the <strong class="bold">My Blueprint</strong> window and click the <strong class="bold">+</strong> button in the <strong class="bold">Variables</strong> category:</li>

<p>In this exercise, we will create our first <a id="_idIndexMarker096"/><a id="_idIndexMarker097"/>Blueprint function. In Blueprint, functions and events are relatively similar, with the only difference being that an event will only have an output pin, usually because it gets called from outside of the Blueprint class:</p>

<p>Now, you know how to create Blueprint functions. Next, we will look at the <strong class="bold">Multiply</strong> Blueprint node we’ll be making use of in this chapter’s remaining exercises and activities.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>Understanding the Multiply node</h1>
<p>Blueprints contain many more nodes that<a id="_idIndexMarker102"/><a id="_idIndexMarker103"/> are not related to variables or functions. One such example is arithmetic nodes (that is, adding, subtracting, multiplying, and so on). If you search for <code>Multiply</code> in the Blueprint <strong class="bold">Actions</strong> menu, you’ll find the <strong class="bold">Multiply</strong> node:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.40 – The multiply node " height="792" src="img/Figure_1.40_B18531.jpg" width="1462"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.40 – The multiply node </p>
<p>This node allows you to input two or more parameters, which can be of many types (for example, integer, float, vector, and so on; you can add more by clicking the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon to the right of the <strong class="bold">Add pin</strong> text) and output the result of multiplying all <a id="_idIndexMarker104"/><a id="_idIndexMarker105"/>of them. We will be using this node later, in this chapter’s activity.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Exploring the BeginPlay and Tick events</h1>
<p>Now, let’s look at two of the most important events in UE5: <strong class="bold">BeginPlay</strong> and <strong class="bold">Tick</strong>.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, events will usually be called from outside the Blueprint class. In the case of the <strong class="bold">BeginPlay</strong> event, this <a id="_idIndexMarker106"/><a id="_idIndexMarker107"/>event gets called either when an instance of this Blueprint class is placed in the level and the level starts being played, or when an instance of this Blueprint class is spawned dynamically while the game is being played. You can think of the <strong class="bold">BeginPlay</strong> event as the first event that will be called on an instance of this Blueprint, which you can use for initialization.</p>
<p>The other important event to<a id="_idIndexMarker108"/><a id="_idIndexMarker109"/> know about in UE5 is the <strong class="bold">Tick</strong> event. As you may know, games run at a certain frame rate, with the most frequent being<a id="_idIndexMarker110"/><a id="_idIndexMarker111"/> either 30 <strong class="bold">frames per second</strong> (<strong class="bold">FPS</strong>) or 60 FPS. This means that the game will render an updated image of the game 30 or 60 times every second. The <strong class="bold">Tick</strong> event will get called every time the game does this, which means that if the game is running at 30 FPS, the <strong class="bold">Tick</strong> event will get called 30 times every second.</p>
<p>Go to your Blueprint class’s <strong class="bold">Event Graph</strong> window and delete the three grayed-out events by selecting all of them and clicking the <em class="italic">Delete</em> key, which should cause the <strong class="bold">Event Graph</strong> window to become empty. After that, <em class="italic">right-click</em> inside the <strong class="bold">Event Graph</strong> window, type in <strong class="bold">BeginPlay</strong>, and select the <strong class="bold">Event BeginPlay</strong> node by either clicking the <em class="italic">Enter</em> key or by clicking on that option in the Blueprint <strong class="bold">Actions</strong> menu. This should cause that event to be added to the <strong class="bold">Event Graph</strong> window:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.41 – The BeginPlay event being added to the Event Graph window through the Blueprint Actions menu" height="266" src="img/Figure_1.41_B18531.jpg" width="1650"/>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.41 – The BeginPlay event being added to the Event Graph window through the Blueprint Actions menu </p>
<p><em class="italic">Right-click</em> inside the <strong class="bold">Event Graph</strong> window, type <strong class="bold">Tick</strong>, and select the <strong class="bold">Event Tick</strong> node. This should cause that event to be added to the <strong class="bold">Event Graph</strong> window:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.42 – The Tick event</p>
<p>Unlike the <strong class="bold">BeginPlay</strong> event, the <strong class="bold">Tick</strong> event will be <a id="_idIndexMarker112"/><a id="_idIndexMarker113"/>called with a parameter, <strong class="bold">DeltaTime</strong>. This <a id="_idIndexMarker114"/><a id="_idIndexMarker115"/>parameter is a float that indicates the amount of time that has passed since the last frame was rendered. If your game is running at 30 FPS, this means that the interval between <a id="_idIndexMarker116"/><a id="_idIndexMarker117"/>each of the frames being rendered (the delta time) is going to be, on average, 1/30 seconds, which is around 0.033 seconds (33.33 milliseconds). If frame 1 is rendered and then frame 2 is rendered 0.2 seconds after that, then frame 2’s delta time will be 0.2 seconds. If frame 3 gets rendered 0.1 seconds after frame 2, frame 3’s delta time will be 0.1 seconds, and so forth.</p>
<p>But why is the <strong class="bold">DeltaTime</strong> parameter so important? Let’s take a look at the following scenario: you have a Blueprint class that increases its position on the <em class="italic">Z</em>-axis by 1 unit every time a frame is rendered using the <strong class="bold">Tick</strong> event. However, you are faced with a problem: there’s the possibility that players will run your game at different frame rates, such as 30 FPS and 60 FPS. The players that are running the game at 60 FPS will cause the <strong class="bold">Tick</strong> event to be called twice as much as the players that are running the game at 30 FPS, and the Blueprint class will end up moving twice as fast because of that. This is where the delta time comes into play: because the game that’s running at 60 FPS will have the <strong class="bold">Tick</strong> event called with a lower delta time value (the interval between the frames being rendered is much smaller), you can use that value to change the position on the <em class="italic">Z</em>-axis. Although the <strong class="bold">Tick</strong> event is being called twice as much on the game running at 60 FPS, its delta time is half the value, so it all balances out. This will cause two players playing the game with different frame rates to have the same result.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">In this book, the <strong class="bold">Tick</strong> event is used a few times for demonstration purposes. However, because of its performance hit, you should be mindful when using it. If you use the <strong class="bold">Tick</strong> event for something that doesn’t need to be done every single frame, there’s probably a better or more efficient way of doing it.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">If you want a Blueprint that is using the delta time to move, you can make it move faster or slower by multiplying the delta time by the number of units you want it to move per second (for example, if you want a Blueprint to move 3 units per second on the <em class="italic">Z</em>-axis, you can tell it to move <code>3 * DeltaTime</code> units every frame).</p>
<p>Now, let’s complete an exercise where we will work with Blueprint nodes and pins.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Exercise 1.06 – offsetting the TestActor class on the Z-axis</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you’ll be<a id="_idIndexMarker118"/><a id="_idIndexMarker119"/> using the <code>BeginPlay</code> event to offset (move) the <code>TestActor</code> class on the <em class="italic">Z</em>-axis when the game starts being played. </p>

<p>In this exercise, you learned how to create <a id="_idIndexMarker124"/><a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>your first Actor Blueprint class with Blueprint scripting logic.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">Both the <code>TestActor</code> Blueprint asset and the <code>Map</code> asset, along with the final result of this exercise, can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Elevating-Game-Experiences-with-Unreal-Engine-5-Second-Edition">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Elevating-Game-Experiences-with-Unreal-Engine-5-Second-Edition</a>.</p>
<p>Now, let’s learn a bit more about the <code>ThirdPersonCharacter</code> Blueprint class.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>The ThirdPersonCharacter Blueprint class</h1>
<p>Let’s take a look at the <code>ThirdPersonCharacter</code> Blueprint class, which is the Blueprint that represents the character that the player <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/><a id="_idIndexMarker127"/>controls, and look at the Actor Components that it contains.</p>
<p>Go to the <strong class="bold">ThirdPersonCPP</strong> | <strong class="bold">Blueprints</strong> directory inside the <strong class="bold">Content Browser</strong> window and open the <strong class="bold">ThirdPersonCharacter</strong> asset:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.48 – The ThirdPersonCharacter Blueprint class " height="928" src="img/Figure_1.48_B18531.jpg" width="1650"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.48 – The ThirdPersonCharacter Blueprint class </p>
<p>Previously, when we introduced the <strong class="bold">Components</strong> window inside the Blueprint editor, we mentioned <strong class="bold">Actor Components</strong>.</p>
<p>Actor Components are entities that must live inside an Actor and allow you to spread the logic of your Actor into several different Actor Components. In this Blueprint, we can see<a id="_idIndexMarker128"/><a id="_idIndexMarker129"/> that there are four visually represented Actor Components: </p>
<ul>
<li>A Skeletal Mesh Component, which shows the UE5 mannequin</li>
<li>A Camera Component, which shows where the player will be able to see the game from</li>
<li>An Arrow Component, which allows us to <a id="_idIndexMarker130"/><a id="_idIndexMarker131"/>see where the character is facing (this is mainly used for development purposes, not while the game is being played)</li>
<li>A Capsule Component, which specifies the collision range of this character</li>
</ul>
<p>If you look at the <strong class="bold">Components</strong> window, you’ll see a few more Actor Components than the ones we can see in the <strong class="bold">Viewport</strong> window. This is because some Actor Components don’t have a visual representation and are purely made up of C++ or Blueprint code. We’ll look at Actor Components in more depth in the next chapter and <a href="B18531_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor154"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a><em class="italic">, Working with UE5 Utilities</em>.</p>
<p>If you take a look at this Blueprint class’s <strong class="bold">Event Graph</strong> window, you’ll see that it’s essentially empty, similar to the one we saw with our <strong class="bold">TestActor</strong> Blueprint class, despite it having a bit of logic associated with it. This is because that logic is defined in the C++ class, not in this Blueprint class. We’ll look at how to do this in the next chapter.</p>
<p>To explain this Blueprint class’s Skeletal Mesh Component, we should first talk about meshes and materials.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>Exploring the usage of meshes and materials</h1>
<p>For a computer to visually represent a 3D object, it needs two things: a 3D mesh and a material. 3D meshes allow<a id="_idIndexMarker132"/><a id="_idIndexMarker133"/> us to specify the shape of an object and its size, while a material allows us to specify its color and visual tones, among other things. We’ll dive deeper into both of these in the following sections and see how UE5 allows us to work with them.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Meshes</h2>
<p>3D meshes allow you to<a id="_idIndexMarker134"/><a id="_idIndexMarker135"/> specify the size and shape of an object, like this mesh representing a monkey’s head:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.49 – A 3D mesh of a monkey’s head " height="320" src="img/Figure_1.49_B18531.jpg" width="404"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.49 – A 3D mesh of a monkey’s head</p>
<p>Meshes are comprised of several vertices, edges, and faces. Vertices are simply 3D coordinates with <em class="italic">X</em>, <em class="italic">Y,</em> and <em class="italic">Z</em> positions; an edge is a connection (that is, a line) between two vertices; and a face is a connection of three or more edges. The preceding screenshot shows the individual vertices, edges, and faces of the mesh, where each face is colored between white and black, depending on how much light is reflecting off the face. Nowadays, video games can render meshes with thousands of vertices in such a way that you can’t tell the individual vertices apart because there are so many of them so close together.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Materials</h2>
<p>Materials, on the other hand, allow you<a id="_idIndexMarker136"/><a id="_idIndexMarker137"/> to specify how a mesh is going to be represented. They allow you to specify a mesh’s color, draw a texture on its surface, or even manipulate its vertices.</p>
<p>Creating meshes is something that, at the time of writing this book, is not properly supported in UE5 and should be done in another piece of software, such as Blender or Autodesk Maya, so we won’t be going into this in great detail here. We will, however, learn how to create materials for existing meshes.</p>
<p>In UE5, you can add meshes through Mesh Components, which inherit from the Actor Component class. There are several types of Mesh Components, but the two most important ones are Static Mesh Components, for meshes that don’t have animations (for example, cubes, static level geometry), and Skeletal Mesh Components, for meshes that have animations (for example, character meshes that play movement animations). As we saw earlier, the <strong class="bold">ThirdPersonCharacter</strong> Blueprint class contains a Skeletal Mesh Component because it’s used to represent a character mesh that plays movement animations. In the next chapter, we’ll learn how to import assets such as meshes into our UE5 project.</p>
<p>Now, let’s learn how to manipulate materials in UE5.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>Manipulating materials in UE5</h1>
<p>In this section, we’ll learn how materials work in UE5.  As<a id="_idIndexMarker138"/><a id="_idIndexMarker139"/> mentioned previously, materials are what specify the visual aspects of a certain<a id="_idIndexMarker140"/><a id="_idIndexMarker141"/> object, including its color and how it reacts to light. To learn more about them, follow these steps:</p>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.54 – The Material Editor window broken down into five parts</p>
<p>Let’s look at these windows in more detail:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1"><strong class="bold">Graph</strong>: Front and center<a id="_idIndexMarker146"/><a id="_idIndexMarker147"/> in the editor, you have the <strong class="bold">Graph</strong> window. Similar to the Blueprint editor’s <strong class="bold">Event Graph</strong> window, the <strong class="bold">Material</strong> Editor’s graph is also node-based, where you’ll also find nodes connected by pins, although here, you won’t find execution pins, only input and output pins.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Palette</strong>: At the right edge <a id="_idIndexMarker148"/><a id="_idIndexMarker149"/>of the screen, you’ll see the <strong class="bold">Palette</strong> window, where you can search for all the nodes that you can add to the <strong class="bold">Graph</strong> window. You can also do this the same way as in the Blueprint editor’s <strong class="bold">Event Graph</strong> window by <em class="italic">right-clicking</em> inside the <strong class="bold">Graph</strong> window and typing in the node you wish to add.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Viewport</strong>: At the top-left corner of the screen, you’ll see the <strong class="bold">Viewport</strong> window. Here, you can preview the result of your material and how it will appear on some basic shapes such as spheres, cubes, and planes.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Details</strong>: At the bottom-left corner of the screen, you’ll see the <strong class="bold">Details</strong> window where, similar to the Blueprint editor, you’ll see the details of either this <strong class="bold">Material</strong> asset or those of the currently selected node in the <strong class="bold">Graph</strong> window.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Toolbar</strong>: At the top edge of the screen, you’ll see the <strong class="bold">Toolbar</strong> window, where you’ll be able to apply and save the changes you’ve made to your material, as well as perform several actions related to the <strong class="bold">Graph</strong> window.</li>
</ol>
<p>In every single Material Editor inside UE5, you’ll find a node with the name of that <strong class="bold">Material</strong> asset, where you’ll be able to specify several parameters related to it by plugging that node’s pins into other nodes.</p>
<p>In this case, you can see that there’s a node called <code>0.7</code> being plugged into the <code>0.7</code>. You can create constant nodes of a single number, a 2 vector (for example, <code>(1,</code> <code>0.5)</code>), a 3 vector (for example, <code>(1,</code> <code>0.5,</code> <code>4)</code>), and a 4 vector (for example, <code>(1,0.5,</code> <code>4,</code> <code>0)</code>). To create these nodes, you can click the <strong class="bold">Graph</strong> window with<a id="_idIndexMarker150"/><a id="_idIndexMarker151"/> the <em class="italic">left mouse button</em> while holding the <em class="italic">1</em>, <em class="italic">2</em>, <em class="italic">3</em>, or <em class="italic">4</em> number keys, respectively.</p>
<p>Materials have several input <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/><a id="_idIndexMarker153"/>parameters, so let’s go through some of the most important ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>BaseColor</code>: This parameter is simply the color of the material. Generally, constants or texture samples are used to connect to this pin, to either have an object be a certain color or to map to a certain texture.</li>
<li><code>Metallic</code>: This parameter will dictate how much your object will look like a metal surface. You can do this by connecting a constant single number node that ranges from 0 (not metallic) to 1 (very metallic).</li>
<li><code>Specular</code>: This parameter will dictate how much your object will reflect light. You can do this by connecting a constant single number node that ranges from 0 (doesn’t reflect any light) to 1 (reflects all the light). If your object is already very metallic, you will see little to no difference.</li>
<li><code>Roughness</code>: This parameter will dictate how much the light that your object reflects will be scattered (the more the light scatters, the less clear this object will reflect what’s around it). You can do this by connecting a constant single number node that ranges from 0 (the object essentially becomes a mirror) to 1 (the reflection on this object is blurry and unclear).</li>
</ul>

<p>UE5 also allows you to import images (<code>.jpeg</code>, <code>.png</code>) as <code>Texture</code> assets, which can then be referenced in a material using <code>Texture Sample</code> nodes:</p>

<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">We will learn how to import files into UE5 in the next chapter.</p>
<p>To create a new <strong class="bold">Material</strong> asset, <em class="italic">right-click</em> on the directory inside the <strong class="bold">Content Browser</strong> window where you want to create the new asset, which will <a id="_idIndexMarker154"/><a id="_idIndexMarker155"/>allow you to choose which asset to create, and then select <strong class="bold">Material</strong>.</p>
<p>With that, you know how to create and manipulate materials in UE5.</p>
<p>Now, let’s jump into this chapter’s activity, which is the first activity in this book.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Activity 1.01 – propelling TestActor on the Z-axis indefinitely</h1>
<p>In this activity, you will <a id="_idIndexMarker156"/><a id="_idIndexMarker157"/>use the <code>TestActor</code> to move it on the <em class="italic">Z</em>-axis indefinitely, instead of doing this only once when the game starts. </p>
<p>Follow these steps to complete this activity:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Open the <code>TestActor</code> Blueprint class.</li>
<li>Add the <strong class="bold">Event Tick</strong> node to the Blueprint’s <strong class="bold">Event Graph</strong> window.</li>
<li>Add the <strong class="bold">AddActorWorldOffset</strong> function, split its <strong class="bold">DeltaLocation</strong> pin, and connect the <strong class="bold">Tick</strong> event’s output execution pin to this function’s input execution pin, similar to what we did in <em class="italic">Exercise 1.01 – creating an Unreal Engine 5 project</em>.</li>
<li>Add a <code>Float Multiplication</code> node to the <strong class="bold">Event Graph</strong> window.</li>
<li>Connect the <strong class="bold">Tick</strong> event’s <strong class="bold">Delta Seconds</strong> output pin to the first input pin of the <strong class="bold">Float Multiplication</strong> node.</li>
<li>Create a new variable of the <code>float</code> type, call it <code>VerticalSpeed</code>, and set its default value to <code>25</code>.</li>
<li>Add a getter to the <code>VerticalSpeed</code> variable in the <code>Float Multiplication</code> node. After that, connect the <code>Float Multiplication</code> node’s output pin to the <strong class="bold">Delta Location Z</strong> pin of the <strong class="bold">AddActorWorldOffset</strong> function.</li>
<li>Delete the <strong class="bold">BeginPlay</strong> event and the <strong class="bold">AddActorWorldOffset</strong> function connected to it, both of which we created in <em class="italic">Exercise 1.01 – creating an Unreal Engine 5 project</em>.</li>
<li>Delete the existing instance of our actor in the level and drag in a new one.</li>
<li>Play the level. You will notice our <code>TestActor</code> rising from the ground and up into the air over time:</li>
</ol>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.56 – TestActor propelling itself vertically</p>
<p>And with those steps completed, we<a id="_idIndexMarker158"/><a id="_idIndexMarker159"/> have concluded this activity – the first of many in this book. We’ve consolidated adding and removing nodes to and from the Blueprint editor’s <strong class="bold">Event Graph</strong> window, as well as using the <strong class="bold">Tick</strong> event and its <strong class="bold">DeltaSeconds</strong> property to create game logic that maintains consistency across different frame rates.</p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>Summary</h1>
<p>By completing this chapter, you have taken the first step in your game development journey by learning about UE5. You now know how to navigate the Unreal Engine editor, manipulate the Actors inside a level, create Actors, use the Blueprint scripting language, and how 3D objects are represented in UE5.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you realize that there’s a whole world of possibilities ahead of you and that the sky is the limit in terms of the things you can create using this game development tool.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, you will recreate the project template that was automatically generated in this chapter from scratch. You will learn how to create C++ classes and then create Blueprint classes that can manipulate properties declared in their parent class. You will also learn how to import character meshes and animations into Unreal Engine 5, as well as become familiar with other animation-related assets such as <em class="italic">Animation Blueprints</em>.</p>
