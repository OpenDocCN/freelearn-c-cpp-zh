                    <h1 class="header-title">Speech Recognition and Voice Synthesizing</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Anyone who has used Amazon's Echo, Google's Home speaker or even Apple's Siri knows how powerful and convenient speech recognition and voice synthesizing can be. Now imagine if we could add these features, at a smaller scale, to our smart devices? If we could, we would have the ability to speak directly to our coffee pot and tell it to start brewing our coffee in the morning or command the robots that we build.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will look at how we can add voice recognition and voice synthesizing to any Arduino projects using the MOVI shield. Throughout this chapter, we will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to use the MOVI shield for speech recognition</li>
<li>How to use the MOVI shield for voice synthesizing</li>
<li>How to create a voice-activated thermometer</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Introduction</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The name <strong>MOVI</strong> stands for <strong>My Own Voice Interface</strong>. The MOVI Arduino shield by Audeme is an extremely easy to use speech recognition and voice synthesizing shield. This shield will work directly with the <strong>Uno R3</strong>, <strong>Duemilanove</strong>, <strong>Mega 2560</strong>, or <strong>Leonardo Arduinos</strong>. However, you should not power the board through the USB connector while the MOVI shield is connected. The MOVI shield requires a minimum of 7V. Therefore, you may damage the MOVI and/or the Arduino if you attempt to power it from a USB connection.</p>
<p>You can read about the MOVI shield and download the user manual from Audeme's website here: <a href="http://www.audeme.com/">https://www.audeme.com</a>.</p>
<p>When powering and programming the Arduino with the MOVI attached, you will want to power the Arduino through the DC supply input connector using an input of 9V. Once the boards are powered up, you can then connect the USB cable between the Arduino and your computer for programming. Since the board was originally powered by the DC supply input connector, it will continue drawing power from that source rather than the USB connection.</p>
<div><strong>Very important:</strong> Do not power the Arduino, when the MOVI shield is connected, from the USB connector.</div>
<p>While programming the MOVI, it is recommended to attach an external microphone, to get better voice recognition, and headphone, so you can hear the MOVI's responses. The following photograph shows the MOVI attached to an Arduino with an external microphone and earphones attached to the MOVI:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/b6829136-9b12-4b4b-897c-b7befb60df48.png" style="width:32.08em;height:24.17em;"/></p>
<p>There is a built-in microphone on the MOVI shield that can be used rather than an external one. However, there is no built-in speaker. To receive audio feedback, which includes errors and system messages, you must connect headphones or an external speaker to the MOVI shield. The speaker impedance should be 32 ohms, which is the standard for headphones. You should not connect a 4- or 8-ohm speaker to the external speaker jack.</p>
<p>The MOVI can be used as a replacement for buttons, remote controls or any other control input. As we will see in the sample project for this chapter, we can use the MOVI to issue voice commands that the Arduino can respond to.</p>
<p>One of the best features with the MOVI shield is that no internet connection is required. This alleviates any privacy concerns that are normally associated with other voice control devices such as the Amazon Echo and Google Home speaker, since no data is sent to external servers.</p>
<p>There is an LED on the MOVI shield, which indicates the state that the shield is in. The following list shows the different states the MOVI shield can be in and the associated LED state:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LED off</strong>: Indicates that the shield is turned off or there is not enough power for the MOVI to operate</li>
<li><strong>LED blinking faster and faster</strong>: The MOVI is booting</li>
<li><strong>LED blinking randomly</strong>: The MOVI is writing to the SD card</li>
<li><strong>LED blinking with constant frequency</strong>: There may be an issue with the SD card</li>
<li><strong>LED on</strong>: Indicates that the MOVI is on and ready</li>
</ul>
<p>The MOVI shield is one of the most interesting and fun boards that you can use with the Arduino. If you are interested in some of the more advanced things you can do with it, you should look at the examples that come with the MOVI library.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will create a voice-activated thermometer using the DHT-11 temperature sensor that we used in <a href="4334ea1c-5df5-4be7-a7c1-86592cb3aaa6.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Environment Sensors,</em> and the MOVI shield. To connect the temperature sensor and the MOVI shield to the Arduino, we will want to attach the MOVI shield to the Arduino first and then connect the DHT-11 temperature sensor to the pin headers on the MOVI shield.</p>
<p>Let's look at the components that we will need for this project.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Circuit diagrams</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The following diagram shows how to connect the DHT-11 temperature sensor for this project. Remember to attach the MOVI shield to the Arduino prior to connecting the temperature sensor. The resistor shown in the following diagram is a 4.7K- ohm resistor:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/2f2a09fc-e918-469f-9179-159603fc1b06.png" style="width:34.75em;height:26.83em;"/></p>
<p>Now let's look at the code for our voice-activated temperature sensor.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Code</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You should already have the DHT-11 library downloaded from the example in <a href="4334ea1c-5df5-4be7-a7c1-86592cb3aaa6.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Environment Sensors,</em> but you will need to download the MOVI library. If you go to the library manager and do a search for <kbd>Movi</kbd>, you will find several libraries that match that term. Look for the <strong>MOVI Voice Dialog Shield library by Audeme LLC</strong> and download it.</p>
<p>We will begin the sketch by including both the MOVI and the DHT libraries. The following code shows how to include both:</p>
<pre>#include &lt;DHT.h&gt;
#include &lt;MOVIShield.h&gt;</pre>
<p>Next, we will define the DHT pin/type and create an instance of the DHT type as we did in <a href="4334ea1c-5df5-4be7-a7c1-86592cb3aaa6.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 9</a>,Â <em>Environment Sensors</em>:</p>
<pre>#define DHT_PIN 3
#define DHT_TYPE DHT11
DHT dht(DHT_PIN, DHT_TYPE);</pre>
<p>Now we will want to create an instance of the MOVI type as shown in the following line of code. The Boolean <kbd>false</kbd> value indicates that we do not want serial debugging turned on:</p>
<pre>MOVI movi(false);</pre>
<p>Finally, we will need a character array that will be used to create the sentence that contains the current temperature so the MOVI shield can tell us the temperature when we ask for it.</p>
<pre>char answer[21];</pre>
<p>Within the <kbd>setup()</kbd> function we will need to initialize both the DHT temperature sensor and also the MOVI shield. The following code shows the <kbd>setup()</kbd> function:</p>
<pre>void setup() {
  dht.begin();
  movi.init();
  movi.callSign("buddy");
  movi.addSentence("temp");
  movi.train();
}</pre>
<p>This function starts off by initializing the DHT temperature sensor by calling the <kbd>begin()</kbd> function from the <kbd>dht</kbd> type. Next, we initiate the <kbd>movi</kbd> type by calling the <kbd>init()</kbd> function. This function must be called first to initialize the <kbd>movi</kbd> type.</p>
<p>Most voice-activated devices like Amazon Echo are activated by a call sign. For Amazon's devices, the call sign is "Alexa." In our example, the MOVI shield will also use a call sign that will activate it. A call sign can be set up using the <kbd>callSign()</kbd> method, where the call sign to use is passed in as a string. In this example, the call sign will be "buddy".</p>
<p>Next, we will want to add a sentence or words that the MOVI will match. We do this with the <kbd>addSentence()</kbd> function. For this example, we will try to match the word "temp." We do have the option of training the MOVI shield with complete sentences or words. If you wish for the MOVI shield to recognize a sentence, it is recommended to add the complete sentence even if you need to add multiple versions of the same sentence. By adding the complete sentence, the MOVI's algorithm can be used to identify the sentence. This gives greater accuracy. It is also recommended that all trained sentences be close to the same size. A single long sentence will be favored over much smaller ones if a lot of words are spoken.</p>
<p>Finally, the <kbd>train()</kbd> method is called to tell the MOVI shield that we have added all of the sentences and the call sign. The first time you add a sentence or call sign the MOVI shield will take some time to train, but if the call sign and sentence stay the same between builds of your application, then the MOVI shield will start up very quickly.</p>
<p>Now that the <kbd>setup()</kbd> function is complete, let's look at the <kbd>loop()</kbd> function. The following code shows the <kbd>loop()</kbd> function:</p>
<pre>void loop() {
  signed int res=movi.poll();
  if (res == 1) {
    float fahreheit = dht.readTemperature(true);
    int tmp = (int)fahreheit;
    sprintf(answer, "The temperature is %02d", tmp);
    movi.say(answer);
  }
}</pre>
<p>In the first line, we use the <kbd>poll()</kbd> function from the <kbd>movi</kbd> instance. This function will poll for any match to the trained sentences. This function would return zero (<kbd>0</kbd>) if no event happened or a positive number if it matches a sentence. The number that is returned is the number of the sentence that it matched. In our example, we only have one sentence. Therefore, the only possible match is to sentence number <kbd>1</kbd>.</p>
<p>If a match to the sentence is found, the current temperature is read from the DHT-11 temperature sensor and then it is converted from a float value to an integer value by typecasting.</p>
<p>To construct the string that we wish for the MOVI shield to say, the <kbd>sprintf()</kbd> function is used. This function can be used to construct a character array. In this example, we start with the sentence <kbd>The temperature is</kbd> and then add the temperature value using the <kbd>%02d</kbd> format. This tells the <kbd>sprintf()</kbd> function to add a two-digit integer to the string. The character array that is created is stored in the answer array that was created at the beginning of this sketch.</p>
<p>We use the <kbd>say()</kbd> function from the <kbd>movi</kbd> instance to have the MOVI shield tell us the current temperature through the connected headphones or speaker.</p>
<p>Now let's run the project.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Running the project</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The first time the project is run, it will take a little time to train the MOVI shield. Wait for the shield to say that it is ready and then use the call sign to activate it. Once you say the call sign, you will hear a beep if the MOVI shield recognizes it. If MOVI recognizes the call sign say the sentence "temp." The MOVI shield should respond back by telling you the current temperature that was read by the DHT-11 temperature sensor.</p>
<p>This example only touches the very basics of what you can do with the MOVI shield and gives you enough to get started with it.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Challenge</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There are other very useful functions that we can use with the MOVI instance. Here are a few additional functions that you can try to add to the project:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>isReady()</strong>: Will return a Boolean value of true if the MOVI is ready or false if it is not ready.</li>
<li><strong>setVolume(int volume)</strong>: Will set the volume of the MOVI's output from 0 (muted) to 100 (full volume).</li>
<li><strong>setVoiceGender(bool female)</strong>: Will set the gender for the MOVI's voice. A true value will set it to a female voice, and a false value will set it to a male voice.</li>
<li><strong>setThreshold(int threshold)</strong>: Sets the noise threshold for the speech recognizer. Values can range from 2 to 95. A value of 15 is good for a noisy environment while a value of 30 is good for a very noisy environment.</li>
<li><strong>welcomeMessage(bool on)</strong>: Will set the MOVI welcome message on or off.</li>
<li><strong>beeps(bool on)</strong>: Turns the recognition beep on or off.</li>
<li><strong>ask() and ask(string question)</strong>: Directly listens without waiting for a call sign. If a string is passed in, then the MOVI will ask the question first before listening.</li>
</ul>
<p>The challenge is to try to add some of these functions in the sample project and see what else you can do with the MOVI shield. Also, try adding additional sentences for MOVI to listen for.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this chapter, we saw how we could use the MOVI shield for both speech recognition and also for voice synthesizing. We used the speech recognition to listen for a specific command and the voice synthesizing to respond to the command.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will look at how we can use DC motors and motor controllers.</p>
