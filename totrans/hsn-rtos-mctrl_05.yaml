- en: If you've ever felt overwhelmed when trying to decide which microcontroller
    or IDE to use, this section is for you. In this section, you'll learn what differentiates
    one MCU from another, how to select an IDE or toolchain that fits your workflow,
    and how to go about debugging and troubleshooting a real-time system. Instructions
    for setting up STMCubeIDE are in [Chapter 5](84a945dc-ff6c-4ec8-8b9c-84842db68a85.xhtml)*, Selecting
    an IDE,* and the SEGGER debugging tools setup is covered in [Chapter 6](699daa80-06ae-4acc-8b93-a81af2eb774b.xhtml),* Debugging
    Tools for Real-Time Systems*. Both of these will be required for working through
    the examples.
