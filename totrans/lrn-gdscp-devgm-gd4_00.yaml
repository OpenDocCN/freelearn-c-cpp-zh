- en: Godot Engine is the most popular free open-source game engine on the market.
    With the advent of Godot 4.0 and the release of many hit games made in Godot,
    such as *Dome Keeper*, *Brotato*, and *Case of the Golden Idol*, this popularity
    only grew. There is no better time to learn how to use this wonderful game development
    tool than now.

- en: Learning how to program and use a new game engine can be a daunting task. However,
    this book will guide you step by step through all the aspects of creating your
    own game from scratch, from the basics of writing our first scripts in GDScript
    to more advanced topics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’ll learn how to program in GDScript, the custom language of the Godot Engine,
    which is easy to learn yet very capable and performant for game development. Then,
    we’ll go over all the ins and outs of the engine’s intuitive graphical interface
    and discover everything about its flexible node-based approach to game development.

- en: This book is for programmers, game designers, game developers, and game artists
    who want to start creating games in Godot 4\. If you’re new to coding or game
    development, looking for a new creative outlet, and want to give Godot 4 and GDScript
    2.0 a try, this book is for you. While no prior knowledge of programming or Godot
    is required, this book gradually introduces more complex concepts as you advance
    through the chapters.
