		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-140"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Chapter 11</em>: IoT Solar Energy (Voltage) Measurement</h1>
			<p>Solar energy is considered one of the most promising <strong class="bold">renewable energy sources</strong> in the face of global warming challenges. It has been considered one of the best alternatives to reduce the dependency on fossil fuels and meet the growing demand for electricity (Ryan, 2005). To achieve this, sunlight is converted into electricity, and the sunlight is collected through solar panels.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will continue creating IoT software for the STM32 Blue Pill microcontroller board using a voltage sensor to measure the solar energy collected by a solar panel. The application will send the sensed data to the internet using the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller board. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Connecting a solar panel to the Blue Pill board</li>
				<li>Reading data from a voltage sensor module</li>
				<li>Coding a program to send the sensed data to the internet</li>
				<li>Showing sensor data results over the internet</li>
			</ul>
			<p>After this chapter, you will have solid skills for developing IoT applications and improving your portfolio because it is a core element in Industry 4.0. The first skill you will learn is reading the solar panel voltage from a sensor connected to the STM32 Blue Pill. Furthermore, you will learn how to send the information read to the internet over the NodeMCU 8266 development board. Finally, you will find out how to visualize sensor values on a mobile IoT application.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>The hardware components that will be needed to develop the solar energy measurement system are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>One solderless breadboard.</li>
				<li>One Blue Pill microcontroller board.</li>
				<li>One NodeMCU microcontroller.</li>
				<li>One ST-Link/V2 electronic interface for uploading the compiled code to the Blue Pill board. Bear in mind that the ST-Link/V2 requires four female-to-female jumper wires.</li>
				<li>One B25 voltage sensor.</li>
				<li>One solar panel.</li>
				<li>Male-to-male jumper wires.</li>
				<li>Female-to-male jumper wires.</li>
				<li>Power source.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All the components can easily be found at your preferred electronics supplier. Remember, you will require the Arduino IDE and the GitHub repository for this chapter: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/DIY-Microcontroller-Projects-for-Hobbyists/tree/master/Chapter11">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/DIY-Microcontroller-Projects-for-Hobbyists/tree/master/Chapter11</a></p>
			<p>The Code in Action video for this chapter can be found here: <a href="https://bit.ly/2U4YMsT">https://bit.ly/2U4YMsT</a></p>
			<p>The next section presents an introduction to the solar panels and the B25 voltage measurement sensor and how to interface them to the STM32 Blue Pill microcontroller board.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Connecting a solar panel to the Blue Pill board</h1>
			<p>Firstly, we need <a id="_idIndexMarker515"/>to learn about two components: the <a id="_idIndexMarker516"/>solar panel and the voltage measurement sensor. After learning the basics, we can build our solar energy measurement system.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Introducing the solar panel</h2>
			<p>Sunlight <a id="_idIndexMarker517"/>carries energy. When sunlight collides with a semiconductor, some energy is changed into moving electrons, generating current. Solar cells (also known as photovoltaic panels or PV panels) were created to take advantage of all the sunlight that reaches our planet. When sunlight reflects off a PV panel, the current output <a id="_idIndexMarker518"/>is constant; this is known as <strong class="bold">direct current</strong> (<strong class="bold">DC</strong>) electricity. This DC can be used to charge batteries and power microcontrollers such as the STM32 Blue Pill.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows a solar panel for use with electronic components, such as our solar energy demonstration system:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16413_Figure_11.1.jpg" alt="Figure 11.1 – Solar panel"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.1 – Solar panel</p>
			<p>To facilitate the <a id="_idIndexMarker519"/>connection and operation with this solar panel, we will solder a pin header to the panel so we can directly connect jumper wires to it. The following figure shows the pin header and how the PV panel looks after being soldered:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16413_Figure_11.2.jpg" alt="Figure 11.2 – Soldering of pin header to the solar panel"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.2 – Soldering of pin header to the solar panel</p>
			<p>You can also find solar panels on the market that already have integrated cables to facilitate their use, such <a id="_idIndexMarker520"/>as the one shown in the following figure:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16413_Figure_11.3.jpg" alt="Figure 11.3 – Solar panel with integrated wires"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.3 – Solar panel with integrated wires</p>
			<p>With the knowledge of what a solar panel looks like and its functionality, let's move on to the following subsection, where we will explore the sensor we will use to measure voltage.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>The B25 voltage sensor</h2>
			<p>If we need to measure voltage, we can use the analog inputs of our STM32 Blue Pill board.These inputs <a id="_idIndexMarker521"/>have a limit of 5V, so if it is necessary to measure higher voltages, it is necessary to use an external sensor to do it. The <strong class="bold">B25 sensor</strong> (see <em class="italic">Figure 11.4</em>) measures voltages in the 5V to 25V range, making it a very popular sensor for this task:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16413_Figure_11.4.jpg" alt="Figure 11.4 – B25 voltage sensor breakout board"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.4 – B25 voltage sensor breakout board</p>
			<p>As can be seen, the module has two terminals to which the external power source will be connected, one to GND and the other to VCC, which must be adjusted with a screw.</p>
			<p>Additionally, the breakout board connects to the STM32 Blue Pill with 3 header pins. They are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">S</strong>: This pin generates an analog signal and must be connected to an analog input of the microcontroller.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">+</strong>: Not connected.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">-</strong>: Ground connection.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>With this information in mind, we will learn how to connect the voltage sensor to the STM32 Blue Pill board in the next subsection.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Connecting the components</h2>
			<p>We will use a <a id="_idIndexMarker522"/>solderless breadboard to connect the sensor and the STM32 Blue Pill microcontroller and finally wire to connect the components. Here's how we wire and connect the components:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Place the voltage sensor and the STM32 Blue Pill on the solderless breadboard. Leave some empty space to add the wires.</li>
				<li>Connect the <strong class="bold">ground</strong> (<strong class="bold">GND</strong>) pin of the sensor to a GND terminal of the STM32 Blue Pill.</li>
				<li>Next, you need to connect the sensor analog output to an analog input on the STM32 Blue Pill card and connect the S of the sensor to pin <strong class="bold">A0</strong> of the Blue Pill, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.5</em>: <div><img src="img/B16413_Figure_11.5.jpg" alt="Figure 11.5 – Voltage sensor connection to the Blue Pill"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.5 – Voltage sensor connection to the Blue Pill</p></li>
				<li>Finally, you will <a id="_idIndexMarker523"/>need a power connection to connect the solar panel to the board. Use the STLink to upload the scripts to the STM32 Blue Pill microcontroller board. <em class="italic">Figure 11.6</em> summarizes all the hardware connections:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16413_Figure_11.6.jpg" alt="Figure 11.6: Circuit for voltage sensor connection"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.6: Circuit for voltage sensor connection</p>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker524"/>screenshot presents the schematics for this project:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16413_Figure_11.7.jpg" alt="Figure 11.7 – Schematics for voltage sensor connection"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.7 – Schematics for voltage sensor connection</p>
			<p>The schematics diagram shows the electrical connections. The VCC and ground terminals of the PV panel were connected to the VCC and GND pins of the sensor. To interface the Blue Pill with the sensor, its ground pin was connected to the GND bus of the Blue Pill, and finally, the analog output (<strong class="bold">S</strong>) of the sensor was plugged into the pin A0 of the STM32 microcontroller. <em class="italic">Figure 11.8</em> shows the solar energy measurement system:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.8 – Solar energy measurement system</p>
			<p>Now that we have finished connecting the components, we have created a simple circuit for our <a id="_idIndexMarker525"/>voltage measurement system, as observed in the previous figure.</p>
			<p>In this section, we learned about solar panels and met a voltage sensor and its components. We also learned how to connect the solar cell to the voltage sensor and the voltage sensor to the STM32 Blue Pill.</p>
			<p>It is time to move on to the next section, which will show you how to write C code to complete our IoT solar energy monitoring system's first functionality.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>Reading data from a voltage sensor module</h1>
			<p>It is time <a id="_idIndexMarker526"/>to learn how to code a program <a id="_idIndexMarker527"/>that will read the information from the voltage sensor and display its reading on the serial monitor.</p>
			<p>Let's write the program to receive the sensor data from the STM32 Blue Pill:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Declare which pin of the STM32 Blue Pill card will be used as input of the sensor data:<pre><code>0</code> (labeled A0 on the Blue Pill).</p></li>
				<li>Next, in the <code>setup()</code> part, start the serial data transmission and assign the speed of the <a id="_idIndexMarker528"/>transfer to 9600 bps, and indicate to the microcontroller the type of pin assigned to A0:<pre>void setup() {
<strong class="bold">  Serial.begin(9600);</strong>
<strong class="bold">  pinMode(sensorPin, INPUT);</strong>
}</pre></li>
				<li>Now, in <code>loop()</code>, first <a id="_idIndexMarker529"/>read the input pin's data sensor, send its value to the serial port, and wait for a second:<pre><strong class="bold">void loop() {</strong>
<strong class="bold">  int sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin);</strong>
<strong class="bold">  Serial.print("Voltage: ");</strong>
<strong class="bold">  Serial.println(sensorValue);</strong>
<strong class="bold">  delay(1000);</strong>
<strong class="bold">}</strong></pre></li>
				<li>We are going to load the program to the STM32 board and review the serial plotter of the Arduino IDE to know the waveform of the analog signal that we are reading from the sensor, and the result can be seen in <em class="italic">Figure 11.9</em>:<div><img src="img/B16413_Figure_11.9.jpg" alt="Figure 11.9 – Sensor signal waveform in the serial plotter"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.9 – Sensor signal waveform in the serial plotter</p><p>The waveform that forms the sensor signal can take the values from <code>0</code> to <code>1023</code>. Then, it will be necessary to convert this value to voltage.</p></li>
				<li>We will <a id="_idIndexMarker530"/>add two lines to our script to <a id="_idIndexMarker531"/>show the voltage value, and we will comment on the one that sends the signal value to the serial port:<pre>void loop() {
  int sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin);
<code>map()</code> function transforms a number from one range to another:</p><pre>map(value, fromLow, fromHigh, toLow, toHigh)</pre><p>The first parameter that <code>map()</code> receives is the value to be converted. In our program, it is the value read from the sensor. The value of <code>fromLow</code> will be mapped to <code>toLow</code>, and <code>fromHigh</code> to <code>toHigh</code>, and all values within the range.</p><p>Now, upload <a id="_idIndexMarker532"/>it to the Blue Pill board. Now <a id="_idIndexMarker533"/>you can see in the <strong class="bold">serial monitor</strong> the <a id="_idIndexMarker534"/>voltage value as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.10</em>:</p></li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16413_Figure_11.10.jpg" alt="Figure 11.10 – Serial monitor readings"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.10 – Serial monitor readings</p>
			<p>For the complete sketch, refer to the <code>Chapter11/voltage</code> folder in the GitHub repository.</p>
			<p>What have we learned so far? We introduced the B25 sensor to measure voltage and know about solar panels. We learned to connect them to our STM32 Blue Pill microcontroller, write the code to read the sensor data, display it on the serial monitor, and graph it in the serial plotter.</p>
			<p>Some new <a id="_idIndexMarker535"/>skills were acquired in this section, and these <a id="_idIndexMarker536"/>skills will help you build electronic systems that require monitoring of the voltage level.</p>
			<p>Next, we will use the NodeMCU microcontroller to send the sensed data to the internet.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>Coding a program to send the sensed data to the internet</h1>
			<p>In this section, we will continue using the NodeMCU development board to receive the data <a id="_idIndexMarker537"/>from the STM32 and send it to the internet. However, unlike <a href="B16413_10_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor135"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">IoT Plant Pot Moisture Sensor</em>, where a digital <a id="_idIndexMarker538"/>value (1 or 0) was sent directly between both microcontrollers, we now need to send the voltage value using serial communication between these microcontrollers.</p>
			<p>Serial transmission is done by sending the data using the RX/TX pins.</p>
			<p>Let's create the program to connect the NodeMCU and the STM32:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In <code>setup()</code>, we need to add new serial data transmission to 115200 bps. It is the recommended speed for the NodeMCU board:<pre>void setup() {
  serial.begin(9600);
  <strong class="bold">Serial1.begin(115200);</strong>
}</pre></li>
				<li>The <code>loop()</code> instance needs a new line after the sensor reading and voltage conversion. The <code>write()</code> function sends the data as an integer value:<pre>void loop() {
  int sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin);
  double voltageValue = map(sensorValue, 0, 1023, 0, 25);
  Serial.print("Voltage: ");
  //Serial.println(sensorValue);
  Serial.println(voltageValue);
<strong class="bold">  Serial1.write((int)voltageValue);</strong>
  delay(1000);
}</pre></li>
				<li>To complete <a id="_idIndexMarker539"/>the communication between the NodeMCU and the STM32, it will be necessary to add <a id="_idIndexMarker540"/>the additional connections shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.11</em> and <em class="italic">Figure 11.12</em>:<div><img src="img/B16413_Figure_11.11.jpg" alt="Figure 11.11 – Circuit for microcontroller serial communication"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.11 – Circuit for microcontroller serial communication</p><p><em class="italic">Figure 11.12</em> shows the schematics diagram for the circuit interfacing between the STM32 and the NodeMCU microcontrollers:</p><div><img src="img/B16413_Figure_11.12.jpg" alt="Figure 11.12 – Schematics for microcontroller serial communication"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.12 – Schematics for microcontroller serial communication</p><p>Connect <a id="_idIndexMarker541"/>the RX pin from NodeMCU to <a id="_idIndexMarker542"/>the TX pin (B6) of the STM32 and the TX pin from NodeMCU to the RX pin (B7) of the STM32.</p><p><em class="italic">Figure 11.13</em> shows how everything was connected in the actual system, including the voltage sensor: </p><div><img src="img/B16413_Figure_11.13.jpg" alt="Figure 11.13 – STM32 and NodeMCU serial connection"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.13 – STM32 and NodeMCU serial connection</p></li>
				<li>Now, to <a id="_idIndexMarker543"/>complete the serial <a id="_idIndexMarker544"/>connection between the NodeMCU and the STM32, we will create a new sketch, <code>Chapter11/voltage_iot.</code></li>
				<li>In <code>setup()</code>, indicate the serial data transmission:<pre>void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
}</pre></li>
				<li>The final step is <code>loop()</code>:<pre>void loop() {
  double data = Serial.read();
  Serial.print("Voltage: ");
  Serial.println(data);
  delay(1000);
} </pre><p>With the preceding code, the NodeMCU will receive the sensor value from the STM32 and will display it on the serial monitor.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The sketch is <a id="_idIndexMarker545"/>now complete. Upload it <a id="_idIndexMarker546"/>to the NodeMCU board, and reset it after completing the upload. Now you can see, in the <strong class="bold">serial monitor</strong>, the sensor value, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<p>It is now time to move on to the next section, which will show you how to visualize data over the internet.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor153"/>Showing sensor data results over the internet</h1>
			<p>In <a href="B16413_09_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor122"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">IoT Temperature-Logging System</em>, and <a href="B16413_10_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor135"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">IoT Plant Pot Moisture Sensor</em>, we learned <a id="_idIndexMarker547"/>how to program IoT applications within our local network. In this section of the chapter, we will learn how to send data to the cloud outside of our local network.</p>
			<p>A wide variety of cloud platforms allow us to connect our IoT devices to their services. Most allow us to use essential services at no cost. If something more complete is desired, there is a charge, generally a monthly payment. This time we will use the Blynk platform, which has several free options, and they are the ones we will use.</p>
			<p>Blynk has <a id="_idIndexMarker548"/>an app for both Android and iOS that will allow us to monitor the value of the voltage in our solar cell.</p>
