- en: Welcome to *Game Development Patterns with Unreal Engine 5*. In this book, we
    will be exploring design patterns, a series of tools and practices through which
    we can learn to write faster and easier to work with code. We will also be exploring
    a range of different patterns and learn to apply them to project development in
    Unreal Engine 5.

    C++/Blueprint blend for maintainable and scalable systems.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is targeted at beginner and intermediate game developers who are working
    with Unreal Engine and would like to improve their C++ coding practices. This
    book will help you produce clean, reusable code using design patterns. We will
    be covering some introductory tasks to show the key fundamentals of using Unreal
    Engine 5 and some of its tools; however, we will not be teaching you Unreal Engine
    from scratch.

    you do not need a deep working understanding of the toolset.

- en: You will need a version of Unreal Engine 5 installed on your computer. All code
    examples have been tested on Unreal Engine 5.0.3, and they should work with later
    versions of the Engine. However, this may not be the case if Epic Games makes
    any major changes to the core engine.

    are already included in the engine, or available to use as part of the many tools
    within the engine.

    before exploring a series of common mistakes that developers make when using Blueprint
    and seeing how to fix them. We will then discover a range of different patterns,
    exploring these with examples built from a mix of Blueprints and C++ and using
    a variety of tools, including World Partition and AI Behavior Trees.
