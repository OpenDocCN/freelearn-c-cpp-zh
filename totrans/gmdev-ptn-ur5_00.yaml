- en: Welcome to *Game Development Patterns with Unreal Engine 5*. In this book, we
    will be exploring design patterns, a series of tools and practices through which
    we can learn to write faster and easier to work with code. We will also be exploring
    a range of different patterns and learn to apply them to project development in
    Unreal Engine 5.

- en: This book is targeted at beginner and intermediate game developers who are working
    with Unreal Engine and would like to improve their C++ coding practices. This
    book will help you produce clean, reusable code using design patterns. We will
    be covering some introductory tasks to show the key fundamentals of using Unreal
    Engine 5 and some of its tools; however, we will not be teaching you Unreal Engine
    from scratch.

- en: You will need a version of Unreal Engine 5 installed on your computer. All code
    examples have been tested on Unreal Engine 5.0.3, and they should work with later
    versions of the Engine. However, this may not be the case if Epic Games makes
    any major changes to the core engine.
