    journey, is very curious to get started with the platform immediately. Well, guys,
    your wait is over, and we welcome you to this chapter with a *Hello World* greeting.
    This chapter not only provides you with a *Hello World* example but also comes
    with many important core concepts of how the **Arduino IoT Cloud** works. This
    is the most important chapter for all readers, as this chapter will give you an
    overview of how to get started with the Arduino IoT Cloud, as the Arduino IoT
    Cloud platform has significant differences compared to other platforms. This chapter
    is divided into two parts; in the first part, you will learn how to use the **Arduino
    MKR Wi-Fi 1010** board to interact with the Arduino IoT Cloud platform, and in
    the second part, you will learn how to use an **API** with **Node-RED** for communication
    with the cloud platform.

- en: Along with these examples, you will learn the difference between a **Thing**
    and a **device**, what a **variable** is, and different properties of Thing. You
    will also get a taste of the **Arduino Web Editor**, which is an awesome feature
    with interesting stuff. After that, we will move on to the dashboard, which helps
    a user control a Thing and visualize sensor data. So, guys, buckle up for this
    interesting journey.

    it operates because it’s a little bit different from traditional IoT cloud platforms.
    As a result, the Arduino IoT Cloud is a more flexible, secure, and industry-deployment-ready
    IoT solution. Firstly, we will understand the design of the Arduino IoT Cloud
    with the following diagram, which will help you to understand the key pillars
    of the Arduino IoT Cloud:'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most cloud platforms work with the concept of devices and sensors, but in the
    Arduino IoT Cloud, we have the concept of the Thing, which includes devices and
    variables known as **sensors**/**actuators**. You may be thinking that a *Thing*
    and a *Device* are both the same; actually, they’re not. It’s important to make
    this distinction because if we do not understand it, then it will create more
    complications going forward.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To understand the difference between a Thing and a device, I am going to take
    an example from real life. Let’s say we have an empty box. If we put some stuff
    in that box, it will be a filled box. However, what if we put the shipping label
    on that box? Will it still be a box? No, now it’s a parcel. So, we can understand
    that a parcel is just a logical container that consists of the box, the stuff
    in the box, and the shipping label.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like the preceding example, a Thing is a logical container that consists of
    a development board, variables that act as a bridge between the cloud and sensors/actuators
    for read/write operations, and network connectivity that makes the Thing live
    in an ecosystem (which is like the shipping label in the box analogy).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, we need to understand how device configuration works in relation to the
    Arduino IoT Cloud. Here, we are not talking about **network connectivity** but
    **device configuration**. Some cloud platforms provide **Arduino IDE** libraries
    or **Software Development Kits** (**SDKs**) for device configuration, but Arduino
    has a different, more restrictive system. Firstly, the Arduino IoT Cloud has two
    ways for device configuration; the first one uses compatible boards via the Arduino
    Create Agent (in the upcoming section, you will dive deep into the Arduino Create
    Agent) and the second way is through an API, which is used for non-compatible
    devices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, why does Arduino have this restriction for device connectivity? Arduino
    cares about security for IoT devices, and security is as vital in an IoT infrastructure
    as water is for living beings. Also, not all the official Arduino development
    boards are compatible with the Arduino IoT Cloud. You can find the complete list
    of Arduino IoT Cloud-compatible devices at [https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/getting-started/technical-reference#compatible-hardware](https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/getting-started/technical-reference#compatible-hardware).
    The Arduino IoT Cloud directly supports some famous boards besides the Arduino
    official compatible boards, which include **ESP8266 Series**, **ESP32 Series**,
    and **LoRaWAN Nodes**. An API is available for other development boards, which
    can be used via any programming language. Later on in this chapter, we will explain
    how to use APIs with Node-RED to communicate with the Arduino IoT Cloud.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, which options are available for **data visualization** and **data extraction**?
    The Arduino IoT Cloud platform provides a variety of options. For data visualization,
    the platform provides a flexible dashboard option for both web and mobile, with
    huge widget features as well as sharing features. For third-party application
    integrations, a **Representational State Transfer** (**REST**) **API** and **w****ebhooks**
    are available. For custom application development or custom integrations, Arduino
    provides **JavaScript** and **Python SDKs**, which enrich the platform’s extensibility.
    An organization can create custom dashboard visualization and control panels by
    using these SDKs.

    they start learning any programming technology to get a taste for a platform.
    However, when it comes to the IoT side, things are different; you will be working
    with hardware and software, which means the *Hello World* example will be different
    from its traditional onscreen appearance. In this section, we will demonstrate
    how to turn on/off a built-in LED of an Arduino MKR Wi-Fi 1010 development board
    using the Arduino IoT Cloud dashboard, which is a *Hello World* example for the
    Arduino IoT Cloud.

- en: The Arduino IoT Cloud provides a different way to connect a device to its cloud.
    Arduino does not publicly reveal its cloud connectivity technique for security
    reasons. That’s why we only have two options to connect devices with the Arduino
    IoT Cloud – using the Arduino Cloud IDE or the API. Also, for the Arduino Cloud
    IDE, it’s mandatory to have the Arduino Create Agent on your machine. *Figure
    2**.2* shows the complete process of how the Create Agent helps devices to interact
    with the Arduino Web Editor.

    boards via a browser. That’s why the Arduino team developed software for all major
    operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, called the Arduino Create
    Agent. The Create Agent acts like a bridge between a device and the Arduino Web
    Editor. The preceding diagram explains the process in detail.

    the Arduino IoT Cloud using a basic LED on/off example. In the first part, we
    used an Arduino IoT Cloud-compatible development board, which was the MKR Wi-Fi
    1010 board, where we learned how to create Things and cloud variables, how to
    associate devices, how to configure networks, and how to create sketches. At the
    end of that section, there was an assignment for you to practice on.

    development boards, such as Arduino UNO, Arduino Mega, and Raspberry Pi, with
    the Arduino IoT Cloud, using Node-RED and the Arduino API interface. Here we have
    explored Node-RED, the Node-RED module for the Arduino IoT Cloud, and generating
    API keys in the cloud. This part of the chapter helped teach you how to use non-compatible
    existing technologies with the Arduino IoT Cloud.

    dashboards, and a lot of widgets for dashboards and the Arduino Web Editor. So,
    in the next chapter, we will explore all those options in detail before moving
    on. [*Chapter 3*](B19752_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor056) is very important for you
    to better understand all of the Arduino IoT Cloud options.
