    We will introduce the concept of sockets, and explain a bit of the history behind
    them. We will cover the important differences between the socket APIs provided
    by Windows and Unix-like operating systems, and we will review the common functions
    that are used in socket programming. This chapter ends with a concrete example
    of turning a simple console program into a networked program you can access through
    your web browser.

- en: There are a few different socket **application programming interfaces** (**APIs**).
    The first were Berkeley sockets, which were released in 1983 with 4.3BSD Unix.
    The Berkeley socket API was widely successful and quickly evolved into a de facto
    standard. From there, it was adopted as a POSIX standard with little modification.
    The terms Berkeley sockets, BSD sockets, Unix sockets, and **Portable Operating
    System Interface** (**POSIX**) sockets are often used interchangeably.

    a cleanup function is called when we are finished. These initialization and cleanup

    take a closer look at what we will be using these sockets for.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Two types of sockets
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sockets come in two basic types—**connection-oriented** and **connectionless**.
    These terms refer to types of protocols. Beginners sometimes get confused with
    the term **connectionless**. Of course, two systems communicating over a network
    are in some sense connected. Keep in mind that these terms are used with special
    meanings, which we will cover shortly, and should not imply that some protocols
    manage to send data without a connection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The two protocols that are used today are **Transmission Control Protocol** (**TCP**)
    and **User Datagram Protocol** (**UDP**). TCP is a connection-oriented protocol,
    and UDP is a connectionless protocol.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The socket APIs also support other less-common or outdated protocols, which
    we do not cover in this book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a connectionless protocol, such as UDP, each data packet is addressed individually.
    From the protocol's perspective, each data packet is completely independent and
    unrelated to any packets coming before or after it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A good analogy for UDP is **postcards**. When you send a postcard, there is
    no guarantee that it will arrive. There is also no way to know if it did arrive.
    If you send many postcards at once, there is no way to predict what order they
    will arrive in. It is entirely possible that the first postcard you send gets
    delayed and arrives weeks after the last postcard was sent.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With UDP, these same caveats apply. UDP makes no guarantee that a packet will
    arrive. UDP doesn't generally provide a method to know if a packet did not arrive,
    and UDP does not guarantee that the packets will arrive in the same order they
    were sent. As you can see, UDP is no more reliable than postcards. In fact, you
    may consider it less reliable, because with UDP, it is possible that a single
    packet may arrive twice!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you need reliable communication, you may be tempted to develop a scheme where
    you number each packet that's sent. For the first packet sent, you number it one,
    the second packet sent is numbered two, and so on. You could also request that
    the receiver send an acknowledgment for each packet. When the receiver gets packet
    one, it sends a return message, **packet one received**. In this way, the receiver
    can be sure that received packets are in the proper order. If the same packet
    arrives twice, the receiver can just ignore the redundant copy. If a packet isn't
    received at all, the sender knows from the missing acknowledgment and can resend
    it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This scheme is essentially what connection-oriented protocols, such as TCP,
    do. TCP guarantees that data arrives in the same order it is sent. It prevents
    duplicate data from arriving twice, and it retries sending missing data. It also
    provides additional features such as notifications when a connection is terminated
    and algorithms to mitigate network congestion. Furthermore, TCP implements these
    features with an efficiency that is not achievable by piggybacking a custom reliability
    scheme on top of UDP.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For these reasons, TCP is used by many protocols. HTTP (for severing web pages),
    FTP (for transferring files), SSH (for remote administration), and SMTP (for delivering
    email) all use TCP. We will cover HTTP, SSH, and SMTP in the coming chapters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: UDP is used by DNS (for resolving domain names). It is suitable for this purpose
    because an entire request and response can fit in a single packet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: UDP is also commonly used in real-time applications, such as audio streaming,
    video streaming, and multiplayer video games. In real-time applications, there
    is often no reason to retry sending dropped packets, so TCP's guarantees are unnecessary.
    For example, if you are streaming live video and a few packets get dropped, the
    video simply resumes when the next packet arrives. There is no reason to resend
    (or even detect) the dropped packet, as the video has already progressed past
    that point.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: UDP also has the advantage in cases where you want to send a message without
    expecting a response from the other end. This makes it useful when using IP broadcast
    or multicast. TCP, on the other hand, requires bidirectional communication to
    provide its guarantees, and TCP does not work with IP multicast or broadcast.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the guarantees that TCP provides are not needed, then UDP can achieve greater
    efficiency. This is because TCP adds some additional overhead by numbering packets.
    TCP must also delay packets that arrive out of order, which can cause unnecessary
    delays in real-time applications. If you do need the guarantees provided by TCP,
    however, it is almost always preferable to use TCP instead of trying to add those
    mechanisms to UDP.

- en: As we mentioned in [Chapter 1](e3e07fa7-ff23-4871-b897-c0d4551e6422.xhtml), *An
    Introduction to Networks and Protocols*, network programming is usually done using
    a client-server paradigm. In this paradigm, a server listens for new connections
    at a published address. The client, knowing the server's address, is the one to
    establish the connection initially. Once the connection is established, the client
    and the server can both send and receive data. This can continue until either
    the client or the server terminates the connection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A traditional client-server model usually implies different behaviors for the
    client and server. The way web browsing works, for example, is that the server
    resides at a known address, waiting for connections. A client (web browser) establishes
    a connection and sends a request that includes which web page or resource it wants
    to download. The server then checks that it knows what to do with this request
    and responds appropriately (by sending the web page).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An alternative paradigm is the peer-to-peer model. For example, this model is
    used by the BitTorrent protocol. In the peer-to-peer model, each peer has essentially
    the same responsibilities. While a web server is optimized to send requested data
    from the server to the client, a peer-to-peer protocol is balanced in that data
    is exchanged somewhat evenly between peers. However, even in the peer-to-peer
    model, the underlying sockets that are using TCP or UDP aren't created equal.
    That is, for each peer-to-peer connection, one peer was listening and the other
    connecting. BitTorrent works by having a central server (called a **tracker**)
    that stores a list of peer IP addresses. Each of the peers on that list has agreed
    to behave like a server and listen for new connections. When a new peer wants
    to join the swarm, it requests a list of peers from the central server, and then
    tries to establish a connection to peers on that list while simultaneously listening
    for new connections from other peers. In summary, a peer-to-peer protocol doesn't
    so much replace the client-server model; it is just expected that each peer be
    a client and a server both.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another common protocol that pushes the boundary of the client-server paradigm
    is FTP. The FTP server listens for connections until the FTP client connects.
    After the initial connection, the FTP client issues commands to the server. If
    the FTP client requests a file from the server, the server will attempt to establish
    a new connection to the FTP client to transfer the file over. So, for this reason,
    the FTP client first establishes a connection as a TCP client, but later accepts
    connections like a TCP server.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Network programs can usually be described as one of four types—a TCP server,
    a TCP client, a UDP server, or a UDP client. Some protocols call for a program
    to implement two, or even all four types, but it is useful for us to consider
    each of the four types separately.

- en: A TCP client program must first know the TCP server's address. This is often
    input by a user. In the case of a web browser, the server address is either input
    directly by the user into the address bar, or is known from the user clicking
    on a link. The TCP client takes this address (for example, `http://example.com`)
    and uses the `getaddrinfo()` function to resolve it into a `struct addrinfo` structure.
    The client then creates a socket using a call to `socket()`. The client then establishes
    the new TCP connection by calling `connect()`. At this point, the client can freely
    exchange data using `send()` and `recv()`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A TCP server listens for connections at a particular port number on a particular
    interface. The program must first initialize a `struct addrinfo` structure with
    the proper listening IP address and port number. The `getaddrinfo()` function
    is helpful so that you can do this in an IPv4/IPv6 independent way. The server
    then creates the socket with a call to `socket()`. The socket must be bound to
    the listening IP address and port. This is accomplished with a call to `bind()`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The server program then calls `listen()`, which puts the socket in a state where
    it listens for new connections. The server can then call `accept()`, which will
    wait until a client establishes a connection to the server. When the new connection
    has been established, `accept()` returns a new socket. This new socket can be
    used to exchange data with the client using `send()` and `recv()`. Meanwhile,
    the first socket remains listening for new connections, and repeated calls to
    `accept()` allow the server to handle multiple clients.

    is established.

- en: A UDP client must know the address of the remote UDP peer in order to send the
    first packet. The UDP client uses the `getaddrinfo()` function to resolve the
    address into a `struct addrinfo` structure. Once this is done, the client creates
    a socket of the proper type. The client can then call `sendto()` on the socket
    to send the first packet. The client can continue to call `sendto()` and `recvfrom()`
    on the socket to send and receive additional packets. Note that the client must
    send the first packet with `sendto()`. The UDP client cannot receive data first,
    as the remote peer would have no way of knowing where to send data without it
    first receiving data from the client. This is different from TCP, where a connection
    is first established with a handshake. In TCP, either the client or server can
    send the first application data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A UDP server listens for connections from a UDP client. This server should initialize `struct
    addrinfo` structure with the proper listening IP address and port number. The
    `getaddrinfo()` function can be used to do this in a protocol-independent way.
    The server then creates a new socket with `socket()` and binds it to the listening
    IP address and port number using `bind()`. At this point, the server can call
    `recvfrom()`, which causes it to block until it receives data from a UDP client.
    After the first data is received, the server can reply with `sendto()` or listen
    for more data (from the first client or any new client) with `recvfrom()`.

    information. `getaddrinfo()` takes a `hints` parameter, which tells it what we're
    looking for. In this case, we've zeroed out `hints` using `memset()` first. Then,
    we set `ai_family = AF_INET`. `AF_INET` specifies that we are looking for an IPv4
    address. We could use `AF_INET6` to make our web server listen on an IPv6 address
    instead (more on this later).

    be using TCP. `SOCK_DGRAM` would be used if we were doing a UDP server instead.
    Finally, `ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE` is set. This is telling `getaddrinfo()` that
    we want it to bind to the wildcard address. That is, we are asking `getaddrinfo()`
    to set up the address, so we listen on any available network interface.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once `hints` is set up properly, we declare a pointer to a `struct addrinfo`
    structure, which holds the return information from `getaddrinfo()`. We then call
    the `getaddrinfo()` function. The `getaddrinfo()` function has many uses, but
    for our purpose, it generates an address that's suitable for `bind()`. To make
    it generate this, we must pass in the first parameter as `NULL` and have the `AI_PASSIVE`
    flag set in `hints.ai_flags`.
  prefs: []

    on. A standard HTTP server would use port `80`. However, only privileged users
    on Unix-like operating systems can bind to ports `0` through `1023`. The choice
    of port number here is arbitrary, but we use `8080` to avoid issues. If you are
    running with superuser privileges, feel free to change the port number to `80`
    if you like. Keep in mind that only one program can bind to a particular port
    at a time. If you try to use a port that is already in use, then the call to `bind()` fails.
    In this case, just change the port number to something else and try again.

    fill in a `struct addrinfo` structure directly. The advantage to using `getaddrinfo()`
    is that it is protocol-independent. Using `getaddrinfo()` makes it very easy to
    convert our program from IPv4 to IPv6\. In fact, we only need to change `AF_INET`
    to `AF_INET6`, and our program will work on IPv6\. If we filled in the `struct
    addrinfo` structure directly, we would need to make many tedious changes to convert

    `stdin` and `stdout`.

    very minimal changes. We would only need to add in an extra `printf()` function with
    the HTTP response header, read from `stdin`, and configure *inetd*.

- en: In this chapter, we learned about the basics of using sockets for network programming.
    Although there are many differences between Berkeley sockets (used on Unix-like
    operating systems) and Winsock sockets (used on Windows), we mitigated those differences
    with preprocessor statements. In this way, it was possible to write one program
    that compiles cleanly on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

- en: We covered how the UDP protocol is connectionless and what that means. We learned
    that TCP, being a connection-oriented protocol, gives some reliability guarantees,
    such as automatically detecting and resending lost packets. We also saw that UDP
    is often used for simple protocols (for example, DNS) and for real-time streaming
    applications. TCP is used for most other protocols.

- en: After that, we worked through a real example by converting a console application
    into a web server. We learned how to write the program using the `getaddrinfo()`
    function, and why that matters for making the program IPv4/IPv6-agnostic. We used
    `bind()`, `listen()`, and `accept()` on the server to wait for an incoming connection
    from the web browser. Data was then read from the client using `recv()`, and a
    reply was sent using `send()`. Finally, we terminated the connection with `close()`
    (`closesocket()` on Windows).

    OK if you didn't understand all of it. We will revisit many of these functions
    again throughout [Chapter 3](eb2e080f-fad2-4e14-b4c1-9a6c124df77c.xhtml), *An
    In-Depth Overview of TCP Connections*, and the rest of this book.

    connections in more depth.
