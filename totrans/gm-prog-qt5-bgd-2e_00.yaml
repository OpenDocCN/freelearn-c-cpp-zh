- en: As a leading cross-platform toolkit for all significant desktop, mobile, and
    embedded platforms, Qt is becoming more popular by the day. This book will help
    you learn the nitty-gritty of Qt and will equip you with the necessary toolsets
    to build apps and games. This book is designed as a beginner's guide to take programmers
    new to Qt from the basics, such as objects, core classes, widgets, and new features
    in version 5.9, to a level where they can create a custom application with the
    best practices of programming with Qt.

- en: From a brief introduction of how to create an application and prepare a working
    environment for both desktop and mobile platforms, we will dive deeper into the
    basics of creating graphical interfaces and Qt's core concepts of data processing
    and display. As you progress through the chapters, you'll learn to enrich your
    games by implementing network connectivity and employing scripting. Delve into
    Qt Quick, OpenGL, and various other tools to add game logic, design animation,
    add game physics, handle gamepad input, and build astonishing UIs for games. Toward
    the end of this book, you'll learn to exploit mobile device features, such as
    sensors and geolocation services, to build engaging user experiences.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book will be interesting and helpful to programmers and application and
    UI developers who have basic knowledge of C++. Additionally, some parts of Qt
    allow you to use JavaScript, so basic knowledge of this language will also be
    helpful. No previous experience with Qt is required. Developers with up to a year
    of Qt experience will also benefit from the topics covered in this book.

    and other projects as well as detailed descriptions of how to create them. We
    advise you to try to create these projects yourself using the instructions we'll
    give you. If at any point of time you have trouble following the instructions
    or don't know how to do a certain step, you should take a pick at the example
    code files to see how it can be done. However, the most important and exciting
    part of learning is to decide what you want to implement and then find a way to
    do it, so pay attention to the "Have a go hero" sections or think of your own
    way to improve each project.
