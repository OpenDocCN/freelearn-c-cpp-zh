<h1 id="_idParaDest-255"><a id="_idTextAnchor256"/>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Congratulations! </p>
<p>You have built a point-and-click adventure game that utilizes 3D assets, incorporates camera and character controllers that respond to player inputs, triggers visual and sound effects for feedback, follows player progress, and loads a new level. </p>
<p>This chapter will cover a topic that is usually covered when you come to the finish line. We will show you how to export your game so that you can share it with the rest of the world. That being said, we’ll also discuss reasons why you might want to export more frequently than just waiting until the end.</p>
<p>After that, we’ll be fully done with the technical parts of the engine. Hence, we’ll present a few pieces of advice, more like guidelines you can follow in your development cycle to be efficient either before you start your projects or during them.</p>
<p>Lastly, you will look at a few game genres for which you can use Godot Engine. Every game engine is usually built around at least one strong and a few core needs. That being said, most engines worth their salt also support the most expected features. You’ll see how some of the knowledge you have gained throughout the book could be expanded upon in new areas.</p>
<p>This is going to be a relatively short and, most definitely, less technical chapter. Nevertheless, we still have the following topics to tackle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exporting your game</li>
<li>Offering different gameplay experiences</li>
<li>Discovering different genres</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of this chapter, you’ll have learned how to export your creation, evaluate different options you can offer to your players, and – finally – find a list of genres you can consider using Godot Engine for.  </p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-256"><a id="_idTextAnchor257"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p>There won’t be any new resources in this chapter. If you prefer, you can continue your own work from the previous chapter or peruse the content we keep in this book’s repository at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Game-Development-with-Blender-and-Godot">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Game-Development-with-Blender-and-Godot</a>.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-257"><a id="_idTextAnchor258"/>Exporting your game</h1>
<p>So, you<a id="_idIndexMarker676"/> have a game. What now? You can keep running the game in the editor, as you’ve been doing all along. At some point, though, you’ll most likely want to show it to your friends and family or even deploy it somewhere public for everybody to look at it. This section will teach you how to export your game so that you can share your creation with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Although we’ll only cover how to do it for Windows, Godot Engine<a id="_idIndexMarker677"/> is also capable of exporting your game to the following platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Android</li>
<li>iOS</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>macOS</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Universal Windows Platform</strong> (<strong class="bold">UWP</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Although exporting<a id="_idIndexMarker678"/> is usually a simple process, it would be wise to check the documentation since updates that platforms receive sometimes change the steps you must take. You can find the most comprehensive list of instructions here: <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.4/tutorials/export/">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.4/tutorials/export/</a>.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">What about consoles?</p>
<p class="callout">Consoles<a id="_idIndexMarker679"/> are not part of the aforementioned list because they lie in a somewhat gray area due to licensing. As a developer, you need to be in touch with a console producer and sign agreements to have access to their tools and kits. In essence, although there is still some technical aspect to this, it also has some moving parts in the legal department.</p>
<p>Before we start tackling Windows-specific export settings, we need to add or change a few things in our project.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-258"><a id="_idTextAnchor259"/>Preparing your project for export</h2>
<p>By default, Godot doesn’t <a id="_idIndexMarker680"/>launch your games in <strong class="bold">Fullscreen</strong> mode even <a id="_idIndexMarker681"/>though it’s something most games use. While in the end, we will make our game cover the whole screen, it’s worth discussing a few other options you will see when you open <strong class="bold">Project Settings</strong>. More specifically, you’ll see two features when you visit the <strong class="bold">Window</strong> section under the <strong class="bold">Display</strong> group, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Resizable</strong>: This option makes your game screen resizable, just as you would be able to resize any other application that’s not in <strong class="bold">Fullscreen</strong> mode. This is on right off the bat, so turn it off.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Borderless</strong>: When your game is not running in <strong class="bold">Fullscreen</strong> mode, it will have to have borders defined by your operating system. Having this option on will remove those borders and the header of the window. By the way, most modern desktop applications—such as Slack, Discord, and likewise—use this feature these days. </li>
</ul>
<p>We suggest you turn on the <strong class="bold">Fullscreen</strong> option and the other two that we just talked about off. After that, this is what our <strong class="bold">Project Settings</strong> screen looks like:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 14.1 – The project settings we are using before we export our game " height="582" src="img/Figure_14.1_B17473.jpg" width="1650"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 14.1 – The project settings we are using before we export our game</p>
<p>So far, we’ve focused only on building the game itself without worrying about the intro, game settings, or credits screens. These can be constructed just like any other Godot scene. Then, once you figure out the flow between these scenes, you can use the <code>change_scene</code> function to transition to the one the player is asking for. Alternatively, you can keep some of <a id="_idIndexMarker682"/>these screens as hidden scenes inside the <code>Game.tscn</code> file <a id="_idIndexMarker683"/>and turn their visibility on as requested.</p>
<p>Since our game will now run in <strong class="bold">Fullscreen</strong> mode, you won’t be able to terminate it by using the operating system’s buttons. In Windows, pressing the <em class="italic">Alt</em> + <em class="italic">F4</em> key combination will exit the window. We need to provide a far better way for the player to quit the game. </p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-259"><a id="_idTextAnchor260"/>Creating a mechanism for turning the game off</h2>
<p>Movies <a id="_idIndexMarker684"/>end with the production companies’ logos and actors’ names on a theater screen. Unless you are really intent on looking at the credits, you will consider this moment as your cue to get up and leave the theater. Either this way or if you want to terminate your movie experience early on at any moment you want, you have the freedom to leave the premises.</p>
<p>A similar situation would happen with the click of a button if you were consuming a movie with a video player on your computer. When we run our little game in <strong class="bold">Fullscreen</strong> mode, since there won’t be any button around to click, this is something you have to present to your players in different forms. </p>
<p>This is usually done by pressing <em class="italic">Esc</em> on the keyboard to reveal a screen—sometimes blocking the game screen and sometimes as an overlay—so that the player can either go into the game’s settings or load a different game session and obviously quit the game. </p>
<p>We will implement only the <em class="italic">Esc</em> press part in this section and treat it as the player’s desire to quit. To that end, we suggest you open the <code>Game.gd</code> script and add the following lines of code to it:</p>
<pre class="source-code">func _input(event):
    if event.is_action_pressed("ui_cancel"):
        get_tree().quit()</pre>
<p>You might have been <a id="_idIndexMarker685"/>expecting to see <em class="italic">Esc</em> in that <code>if</code> block. It’s there but as <a id="_idIndexMarker686"/>an <strong class="bold">identifier</strong>. If you go to <strong class="bold">Project Settings</strong> and bring up the <strong class="bold">Input Map</strong> tab, you will see a list of shortcuts that are mapped to easily comprehensible names. The following screenshot shows a portion of <strong class="bold">Input Map</strong>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 14.2 – The Input Map tab is part of Project Settings " height="631" src="img/Figure_14.2_B17473.jpg" width="1650"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 14.2 – The Input Map tab is part of Project Settings</p>
<p>If you’re building games that allow your players to use multiple input devices, then configuring <strong class="bold">Input Map</strong> will be tremendously helpful. For example, you could set it so that a game controller or a joystick’s button press means the same thing if the player wishes to exert the same behavior with a keyboard. It’s a neat way of consolidating different inputs under one name you can easily follow in your code.</p>
<p>We took care of screen sizes and letting the player quit the game, so we should be all set for exporting our game.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-260"><a id="_idTextAnchor261"/>Configuring Windows export settings</h2>
<p>Godot’s download size is<a id="_idIndexMarker687"/> extremely small compared to other game engines. One of the reasons for this is that it doesn’t come loaded with export packages. Platform requirements sometimes change and Godot’s specific functionalities must conform to their guidelines, so it makes sense to download and get updates on export packages as you go. </p>
<p>Since we’ve never exported a game, there is no export package in our setup. To get one, press the <strong class="bold">Editor</strong> button in the top menu to access the <strong class="bold">Manage Export Templates</strong> setting. When you bring it up, you will see an interface with which you can download and install the right package for the version you are using. The following screenshot shows the current state of export templates:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 14.3 – This screen will help us download export templates " height="631" src="img/Figure_14.3_B17473.jpg" width="1650"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 14.3 – This screen will help us download export templates</p>
<p>You should press the <strong class="bold">Download and Install</strong> button and wait. Once that’s done, you could press the <strong class="bold">Close</strong> button in that interface. Next in our export efforts is to work with the <strong class="bold">Export</strong> settings, so follow these steps: </p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> button in the top menu and select <strong class="bold">Export</strong> among the options.</li>
<li>Press the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button and choose <strong class="bold">Windows Desktop</strong> among the options.</li>
<li>Fill out the <code>Build</code> folder outside the project files, so we defined it as <code>../Build/Clara.exe</code>.</li>
<li>Press the <strong class="bold">Export Project</strong> button in the bottom part of the <strong class="bold">Export</strong> interface.</li>
<li>Turn off the <strong class="bold">Export With Debug</strong> option near the bottom. Confirm your file path and press <strong class="bold">Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before we move on to<a id="_idIndexMarker688"/> explaining things, here is a visual representation of some of the steps you had to take for exporting:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 14.4 – Some of the export settings for Windows " height="874" src="img/Figure_14.4_B17473.jpg" width="1633"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 14.4 – Some of the export settings for Windows</p>
<p>These steps, assuming your Windows is running on a 64-bit machine, will export your game to the folder you defined. When you run the executable, you should be playing the game just as you were while you were developing it in Godot. Pressing <em class="italic">Esc</em> will terminate the program and take you back to the operating system.</p>
<p>You might have noticed an extra file with a PCK extension besides <code>Clara.exe</code>. If you want to keep those two together, you can turn on the <strong class="bold">Embed PCK</strong> option in the <strong class="bold">Export</strong> settings, yet keeping things separate might be a good idea too. Godot keeps your game’s resources in a separate package file and uses it when you run the executable.</p>
<p>Why or when would this be<a id="_idIndexMarker689"/> useful? If you want to enhance your game with more content, you can create only content packages and instruct the game executable to pull them in. Your next DLC might be just around the corner, and this is a useful mechanism toward that goal. </p>
<p>Not only do you have a finished game, but you can also ship it! Exciting, indeed. Although we have provided mostly technical instructions, we feel it would also be valuable to share a few words about different gameplay experiences you can offer to your players.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-261"><a id="_idTextAnchor262"/>Offering different gameplay experiences</h1>
<p>Sometimes, it’s OK to use <a id="_idIndexMarker690"/>prototype assets or another artist’s creations so that you can focus on fun. We are saying this with a word of caution because we’ll always advise you to be sure of the license of the assets you are using. That being said, the topic we want to discuss is what you do with the assets once you have access to them.</p>
<p>The <code>Models</code> folder contains extra assets that we didn’t use throughout the book. When you were constructing the first level in <a href="B17473_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor146"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Designing the Level</em>, we mentioned that you could use some of those other assets. Maybe you did and had to follow the instructions in later chapters based on your own conditions, especially with input detection, pathfinding, and likewise.</p>
<p>At some point, as with right now in the last pages of this book, you might find yourself at a loss for coming up with what more to add to your game. </p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-262"><a id="_idTextAnchor263"/>Having an iterative creation process</h2>
<p>Some people find it much more<a id="_idIndexMarker691"/> empowering to have visual assets laid right in front of them. The creative juices start flowing when they look at different objects’ size-and-shape relationships. Then, there are others who find this inconvenient and getting in the way of drawing out a proper plan. If they figure out what needs to be done, they can start altering assets or looking for new ones. Finally, a mix of both of these approaches might work. </p>
<p>In the end—specifically, if you want to go commercial with your work—you’ve got to keep the player in the center of your workflow. Quick iterations followed by early and frequent playtesting might be what you need. The ramifications of some of your choices mixed with players’ expectations from the game might create a lot of stress, so be aware of this. We’ll give you an example by using the assets and layout of the second level.</p>
<p>There are currently two bookcases on that level: an upright one and a knocked-down one. This is a relatively cheap and effective storytelling method. Why is one bookcase on the floor? Perhaps there was a calamity, but we don’t know. Is it going to be moved out of the way? If you, as a developer, want it or the playtesting shows it’s a strong request, then you have to spend more time in Blender or Godot to come up with an animation plan for the bookcase. Clara will most likely need another action that shows her lifting up and moving the bookcase. If she shouldn’t because it’s unlikely that she can lift up such a heavy object, then you either need a tool or a companion that can help her.</p>
<p>One simple change or request, and you will be inundated with a series of tasks. Unfortunately, not all these changes will be visual either. You’ll have to account for the programming parts where you have to keep the state of the bookcase still on the floor or moved out of the way. </p>
<p>Ultimately, as the creator, you’ve got to ask yourself where this effort might be leading. If you could take this idea to have Clara access another level or a secret used in the game—in other words, mix it with something that already exists as a mechanic—you can replicate it with the minimum number of steps; it might be worth it. </p>
<p>So, it’s always a trade-off. As <a id="_idIndexMarker692"/>much as you should honor fun and your players’ requests, you should approach it carefully and also consider what works best for you.</p>
<p>As we are wrapping up our book, let us discuss which other things you can do with Godot.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-263"><a id="_idTextAnchor264"/>Discovering different genres</h1>
<p>Even though Godot Engine is <a id="_idIndexMarker693"/>known for creating quality 2D games and other well-known engines are preferred for building 3D games, you have seen that Godot is actually quite capable of building a 3D game. This is going to change for the better when Godot 4 comes out.</p>
<p>Until then, what else can you do with Godot? You can build any kind of game with it, to be honest. There has also been a recent trend to build desktop applications using Godot Engine. However, we will consider these cases as extraordinary and instead focus on some more commonly known genres that employ 3D features, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simulation and strategy games: When you used raycasting to detect user input, it was done so that Clara could move to a particular spot with pathfinding. In a simulation or strategy game, either on a grid or free-move structure, your selected unit or units could move to their designated destination in a similar way. You could even combine a turn-based feature on top of this where you keep track of which side’s units have already moved.</li>
<li>Racing games: Godot already has a <strong class="bold">VehicleBody</strong> node to simulate the behavior of a car. Isn’t that nice! By appropriately placing a <strong class="bold">Camera</strong> node inside a <strong class="bold">MeshInstance</strong> node and combining the mechanics of a <strong class="bold">VehicleBody</strong> node, you could be building the next awesome racing game. Start your engine, Godot Engine, and vroom!</li>
<li>First-person shooters: A classic example that could definitely be built with Godot Engine. You’ll be using raycasting a lot in this type of game where you detect whether bullets connect with objects. If they do, maybe a good mix of technical and creative problems lies ahead of you. Should bullets penetrate or destroy every object the same way? </li>
<li>Role-playing games: This is <a id="_idIndexMarker694"/>similar to First-person shooters, so it could be done. In this genre, you generally have a lengthy narrative to present to your player. Also, you’ve got to keep track of where the player is in the story and whether they have met some of the conditions to reveal the following parts of the story or the outcome of a puzzle. We haven’t discovered this in this book, but it would be wise to check out <code>Resource</code> as a useful Godot mechanism to facilitate content-heavy games. </li>
<li>Multiplayer/Co-op: This is not a genre by itself, since any genre can be made multiplayer or co-op. However, there are some games where the experience won’t be the same without networking, so we had to mention this separately. Godot has networking parts you can use to connect to third-party services or have two computers in the <a id="_idIndexMarker695"/>same network connect to each other. </li>
</ul>
<p>These are some of the genres that can most definitely be made with Godot. You can also include some other genres such as puzzles or sports games, or any other subgenre that uses 3D assets. </p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-264"><a id="_idTextAnchor265"/>Summary</h1>
<p>As we are concluding our book in this chapter, your game project is also coming to an end. Hence, we opened it by showing you the necessary steps for exporting your game. Even though it might seem like you’d tackle this phase once your game is built, as was mentioned in the <em class="italic">Iterative creation process</em> section, it might be wise to export your game often and share it with others for frequent feedback. </p>
<p>The rest of the chapter was dedicated to discussing different approaches you can take in your game development efforts, best practices, general guidelines, and—finally—getting to know different genres you can target.</p>
<p>You’ve come a long way in your game development journey. It started with Blender in the first five chapters and continued with a few transitional chapters until you fully switched to building a game with Godot Engine. Hopefully, you now have a much better opinion about how things work in both applications. Also, if you have some prior experience, we hope that this book has increased your confidence level in some areas. </p>
<p>As we are leaving you, we wish you the very best in your future efforts, and may your code compile the first time!</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-265"><a id="_idTextAnchor266"/>Further reading</h1>
<p>You might have noticed that the exported game is using Godot’s icon. It would be nice to have your own custom icon. There are several moving parts to this, but it’s possible. The instructions are listed at <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.4/tutorials/export/changing_application_icon_for_windows.xhtml">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.4/tutorials/export/changing_application_icon_for_windows.xhtml</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to deploy your game for feedback purposes instead of sending files over emails or chat applications, you can use the following platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://itch.io">https://itch.io</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gotm.io">https://gotm.io</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The latter URL is especially useful in our situation because that platform also hosts Godot game jams. For PC games, Steam is a big marketplace, but the aforementioned places might work faster than signing up and going through the application process on Steam.</p>
