    more expressive templated programming. With their inherent ability to specify
    constraints on template arguments, concepts promise to reshape how we interact

    for their template parameters. With concepts, these requirements become explicit
    and understandable. For instance, the `std::sort` algorithm requires random access
    iterators, which can now be asserted using concepts. This leads to more precise
    error messages if one mistakenly uses a list (which only provides bidirectional

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When working with C++ template programming, ensuring that a given type satisfies
    a specific set of requirements has historically been challenging. Before the introduction
    of concepts, developers would rely on complex techniques involving **substitution
    failure is not an error** (**SFINAE**) or specialized trait classes to impose
    type constraints. These methods were verbose and error-prone, often resulting
    in convoluted error messages that were difficult to decipher.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Concepts allow developers to define a set of predicates that a type must satisfy,
    offering a more structured and readable way to constrain templates. Using concepts,
    you can specify the requirements that template arguments must meet. When a type
    does not match the constraints defined by a concept, the compiler will reject
    the template instantiation, producing a more straightforward and more meaningful
    error message. This enhances the template code’s readability, maintainability,
    and robustness. With concepts, the compiler can quickly ascertain the suitability
    of a type for a given template, ensuring that only appropriate types are utilized,
    thereby minimizing the potential for runtime errors or undefined behavior.

    The `Printable` concept checks if a type can be printed to `std::cout`. We then
    have two function templates, `printValue`, and `printValueSFINAE`, that print
    a value if it satisfies the concept or the SFINAE condition, respectively.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When using the `printValue` function template with the `Printable` concept,
    the compiler will ensure that the type passed to it can be printed, and if not,
    it will produce a clear error message. This makes the code more readable and provides
    meaningful error messages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, when using the `printValueSFINAE` function template, we rely
    on SFINAE to achieve the same task. This approach is more verbose and error-prone,
    as it involves complex `std::enable_if` constructs and may lead to cryptic error
    messages when the constraints are unmet.
