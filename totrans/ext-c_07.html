			<h1 id="_idParaDest-115" class="chapterTitle" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor211"/>Composition and Aggregation</h1>
			<p class="normal"><a id="_idTextAnchor212"/>In the previous chapter, we talked about encapsulation and information hiding. In this chapter, we continue with object orientation in C and we'll discuss the various relationships that can exist between two classes. Eventually, this will allow us to expand our object model and express the relations between objects as part of the upcoming chapters.</p>
			<p class="normal">As part of this chapter, we discuss:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="list">Types of relations that can exist between two objects and their corresponding classes: We will talk about <em class="italics">to-have</em> and <em class="italics">to-be</em> relationships, but our focus will be on to-have relations in this chapter.</li>
				<li class="list"><em class="italics">Composition</em> as our first to-have relation: An example will be given to demonstrate a real composition relationship between two classes. Using the given example, we explore the memory structure which we usually have in case of composition.</li>
				<li class="list"><em class="italics">Aggregation</em> as the second to-have relation: It is similar to composition since both of them address a to-have relationship. But they are different. We will give a separate complete example to cover an aggregation case. The difference among aggregation and composition will shine over the memory layout associated with these relationships.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">This is the second of the four chapters covering OOP in C. The to-be relationship, which is also called <em class="italics">inheritance</em>, will be covered in the next chapter.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-116" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor213"/>Relations between classes</h1>
			<p class="normal"><a id="_idTextAnchor214"/>An object model is a set of<a id="_idIndexMarker547"/> related objects. The number of relations can be many, but there are a few relationship types that can exist between two objects. Generally, there are two categories of relationships found between objects (or their corresponding classes): to-have relationships and to-be relationships.</p>
			<p class="normal">We'll explore to-have<a id="_idIndexMarker548"/> relationships in depth in this chapter, and we'll cover to-be relationships in the next chapter. In addition, we will also see how the relationships between various objects can lead to relationships between their corresponding classes. Before dealing with that, we need to be able to distinguish between a class and an object.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-117" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor215"/>Object versus class</h1>
			<p class="normal">If you remember from the<a id="_idIndexMarker549"/> previous chapter, we have two approaches for constructing objects. One approach is <em class="italics">prototype-based</em> and the other is <em class="italics">class-based</em>.</p>
			<p class="normal">In the prototype-based<a id="_idIndexMarker550"/> approach, we construct an object either empty (without any attribute or behavior), or we <a id="_idIndexMarker551"/>clone it from an existing object. In this context, <em class="italics">instance</em> and <em class="italics">object</em> mean the same thing. So, the prototype-based approach can be read as the object-based approach; an approach that begins from empty objects instead of classes.</p>
			<p class="normal">In the class-based approach, we<a id="_idIndexMarker552"/> cannot construct an object without having a blueprint that is often called a <em class="italics">class</em>. So, we should start from a class. And then, we can instantiate an object from it. In the previous chapter, we explained the implicit encapsulation technique that defines a class as a set of declarations put in a header file. We also gave some examples showing how this works in C.</p>
			<p class="normal">Now, as part of this section, we want to talk more about the differences between a class and an object. While the differences seem to be trivial, we want to dive deeper and study them carefully. We begin by giving an example.</p>
			<p class="normal">Suppose that we define a class, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Person</code>. It has the following attributes: <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">name</code>, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">surname</code>, and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">age</code>. We won't talk about the behaviors because the differences usually come from the attributes, and not the behaviors. </p>
			<p class="normal">In C, we can write the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Person</code> class with public attributes as follows:</p>
			<pre>typedef struct {
  char name[32];
  char surname[32];
  unsigned int age;
} <strong class="highlight">person_t;</strong></pre>
			<p class="packt_figref">Code Box 7-1: The Person attribute structure in C</p>
			<p class="normal">And in C++:</p>
			<pre>class <strong class="highlight">Person</strong> {
public:
  std::string name;
  std::string family;
  uint32_t age;
};</pre>
			<p class="packt_figref">Code Box 7-2: The Person class's class in C++</p>
			<p class="normal">The preceding code boxes<a id="_idIndexMarker553"/> are identical. In fact, the current discussion can be applied to both C and C++, and even other OOP languages such as Java. A class (or an object template) is a blueprint that only determines the attributes required to be present in every<a id="_idIndexMarker554"/> object, and <em class="italics">not</em> the values that these attributes might have in one specific object. In fact, each object has its own specific set of values for the same attributes that exist in other objects instantiated from the same class. </p>
			<p class="normal">When an object is created based on a class, its memory is allocated first. This allocated memory will be a placeholder for the attribute values. After that, we need to initialize the attribute values with some values. This is an important step, otherwise, the object might have an invalid state after being created. As you've already seen, this step is called <em class="italics">construction</em>.</p>
			<p class="normal">There is usually a dedicated function that performs the construction step, which is called the <em class="italics">constructor</em>. The functions <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">list_init</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">car_construct</code> in the examples, found in the previous chapter, were constructor functions. It is quite possible that as part of constructing an object, we need to allocate even more memory for resources such as other objects, buffers, arrays, streams, and so on required by that object. The resources owned by the object must have been released before having the owner object freed.</p>
			<p class="normal">We also have another function, similar to the constructor, which is responsible for freeing any allocated resources. It is called the <em class="italics">destructor</em>. Similarly, the functions <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">list_destroy</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">car_destruct</code> in the examples found in the previous chapter were destructors. After destructing an object, its allocated memory is freed, but before that, all the owned resources and their corresponding memories must be freed.</p>
			<p class="normal">Before moving on, let's sum up what we've explained so far:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="list">A class is a blueprint that is used as a map for creating objects.</li>
				<li class="list">Many objects can be made from the same class.</li>
				<li class="list">A class determines which attributes should be present in every future object created based on that class. It doesn't say anything about the possible values they can have.</li>
				<li class="list">A class itself does not consume<a id="_idIndexMarker555"/> any memory (except in some programming languages other than C and C++) and only exists at the source level and at compile time. But objects exist at runtime and consume memory.</li>
				<li class="list">When creating an object, memory allocation happens first. In addition, memory deallocation is the last operation for an object.</li>
				<li class="list">When creating an object, it should be constructed right after memory allocation. It should be also destructed right before deallocation.</li>
				<li class="list">An object might be <a id="_idIndexMarker556"/>owning some resources such as streams, buffers, arrays, and so on, that must be released before having the object destroyed.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">Now that you know the differences between a class and an object, we can move on and explain the different relationships that can exist between two objects and their corresponding classes. We'll start with com<a id="_idTextAnchor216"/>position.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-118" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor217"/>Composition</h1>
			<p class="normal">As the term "composition" implies, when an object contains or possesses another object – in other words, it is composed of another object – we say that there is a composition relationship between them. </p>
			<p class="normal">As an example, a car has an<a id="_idIndexMarker557"/> engine; a car is an object that contains an engine object. Therefore, the car and engine objects have a composition relationship. There is an important condition that a composition relationship must have: <em class="italics">the lifetime of the contained object is bound to the lifetime of the container object</em>.</p>
			<p class="normal">As long as the container object exists, the contained object must exist. But when the container object is about to get destroyed, the contained object must have been destructed first. This condition implies that the contained object is often internal and private to the container.</p>
			<p class="normal">Some parts of the contained object may be still accessible through the public interface (or behavior functions) of the container class, but the lifetime of the contained object must be managed internally by the container object. If a piece of code can destruct the contained object without destructing the container object, it is a breach of the composition relationship and the relationship is no longer a composition.</p>
			<p class="normal">The following example, <em class="italics">example 7.1</em>, demonstrates the composition relationship between a car object and an engine object. </p>
			<p class="normal">It is composed of five files: two header files, which declare the public interfaces of the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Car</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Engine</code> classes; two source files, which contain the implementation of the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Car</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Engine</code> classes; and finally, a source file, which contains the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">main</code> function and <a id="_idIndexMarker558"/>executes a simple scenario using a car and its engine object.</p>
			<p class="normal">Note that, in some domains, we can have engine objects outside of the car objects; for example, in mechanical engineering CAD software. So, the type of relationships between the various objects is determined by the problem domain. For the sake of our example, imagine a domain in which engine objects could not exist outside of car objects.</p>
			<p class="normal">The following code box shows the header file for the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Car</code> class:</p>
			<pre>#ifndef EXTREME_C_EXAMPLES_CHAPTER_7_1_CAR_H

#endif</pre>
			<p class="packt_figref">Code Box 7-3 [ExtremeC_examples_chapter7_1_car.h]: The public interface of the Car class</p>
			<p class="normal">As you see, the preceding declarations have been made in a similar way to what we did for the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">List</code> class in the last example of the previous chapter, <em class="italics">example 6.3</em>. One of the differences is that we have chosen a new suffix for the constructor function; <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">car_new</code> instead of <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">car_construct</code>. The other difference is that we have only declared the attribute structure <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">car_t</code>. We have not defined its fields, and this is called a <em class="italics">forward declaration</em>. The definition for the structure <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">car_t</code> will be in the source file which comes in the code box 7-5. Note that in the <a id="_idIndexMarker559"/>preceding header file, the type <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">car_t</code> is considered an incomplete type which is not defined yet.</p>

			<p class="packt_figref">Code Box 7-4 [ExtremeC_examples_chapter7_1_engine.h]: The public interface of the Engine class</p>
			<p class="normal">The following code boxes contains the implementations done for the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Car</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Engine</code> classes. We begin with the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Car</code> class:</p>
			<pre>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

typedef struct {
  // Composition happens because of this attribute

  return engine_get_temperature(car-&gt;engine);
}</pre>
			<p class="packt_figref">Code Box 7-5 [ExtremeC_examples_chapter7_1_car.c]: The definition of the Car class</p>
			<p class="normal">The preceding code box shows <a id="_idIndexMarker560"/>how the car has contained the engine. As you see, we have a new attribute as part of the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">car_t</code> attribute structure, and it is of the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">struct engine_t*</code> type. Composition happens because of this attribute.</p>
			<p class="normal">Though the type <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">struct engine_t*</code> is still incomplete inside this source file, it can point to an object from a complete <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">engine_t</code> type at runtime. This attribute will point to an object that is going to be constructed as part of the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Car</code> class's constructor, and it will be freed inside the destructor. At both places, the car object exists, and this means that the engine's lifetime is included in the car's lifetime.</p>
			<p class="normal">The <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">engine</code> pointer<a id="_idIndexMarker561"/> is private, and no pointer is leaking from the implementation. That's an important note. When you are implementing a composition relationship, no pointer should be leaked out otherwise it causes external code to be able to change the state of the contained object. Just like encapsulation, no pointer should be leaked out when it gives direct access to the private parts of an object. Private parts should always be accessed indirectly via behavior functions.</p>
			<p class="normal">The <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">car_get_engine_temperature</code> function in the code box gives access to the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">temperature</code> attribute of the engine. However, there is an important note regarding this function. It uses the public interface of the engine. If you pay attention, you'll see that the <em class="italics">car's private implementation</em> is consuming the <em class="italics">engine's public interface</em>.</p>
			<p class="normal">This means that the car itself doesn't know anything about the implementation details of the engine. This is the way that it should be. </p>
			<p class="normal"><em class="italics">Two objects that are not of the same type, in most cases, must not know about each other's implementation details</em>. This is what information hiding dictates. Remember that the car's behaviors are considered external to the engine.</p>
			<p class="normal">This way, we can replace the implementation of the engine with an alternative one, and it should work, as long as the new implementation provides definitions for the same public functions declared in the engine's header file.</p>
			<p class="normal">Now, let's look at the implementation of the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Engine</code> class:</p>
			<pre>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

}</pre>
			<p class="packt_figref">Code Box 7-6 [ExtremeC_examples_chapter7_1_engine.c]: The definition of the Engine class</p>
			<p class="normal">The preceding code is just using the implicit<a id="_idIndexMarker562"/> encapsulation approach for its private implementation, and it is very similar to previous examples. But there is one thing to note about this. As you see, the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">engine</code> object doesn't know that an external object is going to contain it in a composition relationship. This is like the real world. When a company is building engines, it is not clear which engine will go into which car. Of course, we could have kept a pointer to the container <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">car</code> object, but in this example, we didn't need to. </p>
			<p class="normal">The following code box demonstrates the scenario in which we create a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">car</code> object and invoke some of its public API to extract information about the car's engine:</p>

Note that the main source file (the source file that contains the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">main</code> function) only depends on the car's public interface. So, when linking, it only needs the private implementation of the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">car</code> object. However, the private implementation of the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">car</code> object relies on the public interface of the engine interface; then, while linking, we need to provide the private implementation of the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">engine</code> object.

			<p class="normal">Inside the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">player_t</code> structure, we declare the<a id="_idIndexMarker568"/> pointer attribute <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">gun</code> that is going to point to a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">gun</code> object soon. We need to nullify this in the constructor because unlike composition, this attribute is not meant to be set as part of the constructor.</p>
			<p class="normal">If an aggregation pointer is required to be set upon construction, the address of the target object should be passed as an argument to the constructor. Then, this situation is called a <em class="italics">mandatory aggregation</em>.</p>
			<p class="normal">If the aggregation pointer can be left as null in the constructor, then it is an <em class="italics">optional aggregation</em>, as in the preceding code. It is important to nullify the optional aggregation pointers in the constructor.</p>
			<p class="normal">In the function <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">player_pickup_gun</code>, the aggregation relationship begins, and it ends in the function <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">player_drop_gun</code> when the player drops the gun.</p>
			<p class="normal">Note that we need to nullify the<a id="_idIndexMarker569"/> pointer <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">gun</code> after dropping the aggregation relationship. Unlike in composition, the container object is not the <em class="italics">owner</em> of the contained object. So, it has no control over its lifetime. Therefore, we should not free the gun object in any place inside the player's implementation code.</p>
			<p class="normal">In optional aggregation relations, we may not have set the contained object at some point in the program. Therefore, we should be careful while using the aggregation pointer since any access to a pointer that is not set, or a pointer that is <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">null</code>, can lead to a segmentation fault. That's basically why in the function <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">player_shoot</code>, we check the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">gun</code> pointer is valid. If the aggregation pointer is null, it means that the code using the player object is misusing it. If that's the case, we abort the execution by returning 1 as the <em class="italics">exit</em> code of the process.</p>
			<p class="normal">The following code is the implementation of the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Gun</code> class:</p>
			<pre>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
typedef int bool_t;
// Attribute structure
typedef struct {
  int bullets;
} gun_t;
// Memory allocator
gun_t* gun_new() {
  return (gun_t*)malloc(sizeof(gun_t));
}
// Constructor
void gun_ctor(gun_t* gun, int initial_bullets) {
  gun-&gt;bullets = 0;
  if (initial_bullets &gt; 0) {
    gun-&gt;bullets = initial_bullets;
  }
}
// Destructor
void gun_dtor(gun_t* gun) {
  // Nothing to do
}
// Behavior functions
bool_t gun_has_bullets(gun_t* gun) {
  return (gun-&gt;bullets &gt; 0);
}
void gun_trigger(gun_t* gun) {
  gun-&gt;bullets--;
}
void gun_refill(gun_t* gun) {
  gun-&gt;bullets = 7;

			<p class="packt_figref">Code Box 7-11 [ExtremeC_examples_chapter7_2_gun.c]: The definition of the Gun class</p>
			<p class="normal">The preceding code is straightforward, and it is written in a way that a gun object doesn't know that it will be contained in any object.</p>
			<p class="normal">Finally, the following code box demonstrates a short scenario that creates a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">player</code> object and a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">gun</code> object. Then, the <a id="_idIndexMarker570"/>player picks up the gun and fires with it until no ammo is left. After that, the player refills the gun and does the same. Finally, they drop the gun:</p>
			<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include "ExtremeC_examples_chapter7_2_player.h"
#include "ExtremeC_examples_chapter7_2_gun.h"
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  // Create and constructor the gun object
  struct gun_t* gun = gun_new();
  gun_ctor(gun, 3);
  // Create and construct the player object
  struct player_t* player = player_new();
  player_ctor(player, "Billy");
  // Begin the aggregation relation.
  player_pickup_gun(player, gun);
  // Shoot until no bullet is left.
  while (gun_has_bullets(gun)) {
    player_shoot(player);
  }
  // Refill the gun
  gun_refill(gun);
  // Shoot until no bullet is left.
  while (gun_has_bullets(gun)) {
    player_shoot(player);
  }
  // End the aggregation relation.
  player_drop_gun(player);
  // Destruct and free the player object
  player_dtor(player);
  free(player);
  // Destruct and free the gun object

			<p class="packt_figref">Code Box 7-12 [ExtremeC_examples_chapter7_2_main.c]: The main function of example 7.2</p>
			<p class="normal">As you see here, the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">gun</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">player</code> objects are independent of each other. The responsible logic for creating and <a id="_idIndexMarker571"/>destroying these objects is the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">main</code> function. At some point in the execution, they form an aggregation relationship and perform their roles, then at another point, they become separated. The important thing in aggregation is that the container object shouldn't alter the lifetime of the contained object, and as long as this rule is followed, no memory issues should arise.</p>
			<p class="normal">The following shell box shows how to build the example and run the resulting executable file. As you see, the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">main</code> function in <em class="italics">Code Box 7-12</em> doesn't produce any output:</p>
			<pre><strong class="highlight">$ gcc -c ExtremeC_examples_chapter7_2_gun.c -o gun.o $ gcc -c ExtremeC_examples_chapter7_2_player.c -o player.o $ gcc -c ExtremeC_examples_chapter7_2_main.c -o main.o $ gcc gun.o player.o main.o -o ex7_2.out $ ./ex7_2.out $</strong></pre>
			<p class="packt_figref">Shell Box 7-2: The compilation, linking, and execution of example 7.2</p>
			<p class="normal">In an object model created for a real project, the amount of aggregation<a id="_idIndexMarker572"/> relationships is usually greater than the number of composition relationships. Also, aggregation relationships are more visible externally because, in order to make an aggregation relationship, some dedicated behavior functions are required, at least in the public interface of the container object, to set and reset the contained object.</p>
			<p class="normal">As you see in the p<a id="_idTextAnchor221"/>receding example, the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">gun</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">player</code> objects are separated from the start. They become related for a short period of time, and then they become separated again. This means that the aggregation relationship is temporary, unlike the composition relationship, which is permanent. This shows that composition is a stronger form of <em class="italics">possession</em> (to-have) relationship between objects, while aggregation exhibits a weaker relationship.</p>
			<p class="normal">Now, a question comes to mind. If an aggregation relationship is temporary between two objects, is it temporary between their corresponding classes? The answer is no. The aggregation relationship is permanent between the types. If there is a small chance that in the future, two objects from two different types become related based on an aggregation relationship, their types should be in the aggregation relationship permanently. This holds for composition as well.</p>
			<p class="normal">Even a low chance of there being an aggregation relationship should cause us to declare some pointers in the attribute structure of the container object, and this means that the attribute structure is changed permanently. Of course, this is only true for class-based programming languages.</p>
			<p class="normal">Composition and aggregation both describe the possession of some objects. In other words, these relationships describe a "to-have" or "has-a" situation; a player <strong class="bold">has</strong> a gun, or a car <strong class="bold">has</strong> an engine. Every time you feel that an object possesses another one, it means there should either be a<a id="_idIndexMarker573"/> composition relationship or an aggregation relationship between them (and their corresponding classes).</p>
			<p class="normal">In the next chapter, we'll continue our discussion regarding relationship types by looking at the <em class="italics">inheritance</em> or <em class="italics">extension</em> relationship.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-120" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor222"/>Summary</h1>
			<p class="normal">In this chapter, the following topics have been discussed:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="list">The possible relationship types between classes and objects.</li>
				<li class="list">The differences and similarities between a class, an object, an instance, and a reference.</li>
				<li class="list">Composition, which entails that a contained object is totally dependent on its container object.</li>
				<li class="list">Aggregation, in which the contained object can live freely without any dependency on its container object.</li>
				<li class="list">The fact that aggregation can be temporary between objects, but it is defined permanently between their types (or classes).</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">In the next chapter, we continue to explore OOP, primarily addressing the two further pillars upon which it is based: inheritance and polymorphism.</p>
