<p>As a boy, the more I took apart the hand-held transistor radios and games the easier it became to identify the various parts that were on the circuit boards. It was a lot harder, however, to figure out how all the parts worked together. While it was possible to take electronic devices apart and put them back together without a basic understanding of the circuit, it was impossible to figure out how the devices actually worked. Once I understood how circuits worked, not only was I able to begin to understand how the electronic devices worked but I was also able to build simple circuits on my own.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>What a circuit is</li>
<li>What open, closed, and short circuits are</li>
<li>What Fritzing diagrams are</li>
<li>What schematic diagrams are</li>
<li>What the differences between series and parallel circuits are</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we can begin developing our own electronic projects we need to have a basic understanding of what circuits are and how to design them. In this chapter, we will look at the knowledge we need to begin designing and creating basic circuits.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">What is a circuit?</h1>
                </header>

<p>A circuit is a circular path in which electrical current flows. In <a href="48ede881-c312-454b-8351-06f6a4734c52.xhtml" target="_blank"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 2</span></a>, <em>Basic Electronics</em> we described electrical current as the flow of electrons. The circuit is the path in which these electrons flow, powering the components that make up the circuit. The point where the electrons enter the circuit, and the current starts, is called the <strong>source</strong>. The point where the electrons exit the circuit is called the <strong>return</strong>. Everything between the source and the return, the components and wires that make up the remainder of the circuit, is called the <strong>load</strong>.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>In a closed circuit, the current has a complete path from the source to the return allowing the current to flow through the circuit. The following diagram shows a closed circuit where a switch is closed allowing the current to flow through the circuit. In this circuit, we are powering a light bulb. This makes the light bulb the load:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/9d42e3aa-4eb3-4e95-bce3-ccfdfefa3317.png" style="width:33.33em;height:35.00em;"/></div>
<p>An open circuit is one that has a break in the circuit that prevents the current flow. The following diagram shows an open circuit where the switch is open, thereby preventing the current flow:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2efb6b2f-38fe-4043-a508-1662716a286b.png" style="width:33.33em;height:35.00em;"/></div>
<p>The last two examples show how a typical light switch works in your house. When you turn the switch on, the circuit is closed, which turns the light on; however, when you turn the switch off, the circuit is open, which turns the light off.</p>
<p>Most multimeters have a continuity mode that can be used to test if you have an open circuit or not. If your multimeter has a continuity mode, you should see a symbol that looks somewhat like this:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/212fb647-cb49-4ac6-9d10-3390522ce17f.png" style="width:18.67em;height:23.58em;"/></p>
<p>If you set your multimeter to continuity mode and touch the two leads together the meter will emit a tone. This tone lets you know that you have a closed circuit. To test if your circuit is closed or open, put the multimeter into continuity mode and place the two leads from the multimeter at different points in your circuit, and if there is a connection between the two points the meter will emit the tone.</p>
<p>The most dangerous circuit is a short circuit. A short circuit is one that allows the current to flow through the circuit with little to no resistance. This is usually a circuit with no load.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox"><span>You should never create a circuit like this because you run the risk of starting a fire.</span></div>
<p>The following diagram shows what a short circuit looks like:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/547a540d-f056-413c-8d00-831b6d90486c.png"/></div>
<p>While the preceding diagrams look nice, it would be almost impossible to show complex circuits with diagrams like these. It is also hard for someone else to understand these diagrams without an explanation, because there are no standard symbols defined. The standard way to represent a circuit is with a schematic diagram.</p>
<p>A schematic diagram, when referring to electronic circuits, is a diagram that contains representations of the elements in the circuit. Each type of electrical component has a standard symbol that is used when representing it on a schematic diagram. These diagrams will show how each component is connected giving anyone that reads the diagram an understanding of how the circuit works.</p>
<p>All the circuit diagrams in this book will be created using the very popular, and free, <strong>Fritzing</strong> application, which can be downloaded here: <a href="http://fritzing.org/home/">http://fritzing.org/home/</a>. At the time this book was written, the latest version of Fritzing is 0.9.3b and is the version used to create all of the diagrams in this book and the diagrams that come with the downloadable code. Let's look at what Fritzing is before we look at the types of diagrams it can produce.</p>

<p>Fritzing is an open-source initiative to develop software to design electronic hardware. This software is designed in the same spirit as the Arduino where it abstracts away the complexity of diagramming the circuit, so the user can focus on the design itself. There will be a <strong>Fritzing sketch</strong> in the downloadable code, for all projects in this book. A Fritzing sketch is a project within the Fritzing application that represents the circuit being created. These projects can contain both circuit diagrams and code if the project includes a microcontroller like the Arduino. We will not be using the coding section of Fritzing in this book and instead will use the standard Arduino IDE, but it is good to know it is there.</p>
<p>The Fritzing sketches included in the downloadable code will allow you to examine the design of each project closer and enables you to adjust the design if you want to. We will also be including either a Fritzing diagram or a schematic diagram in the book itself for each project to show how to create the circuit. Both types of diagrams will be generated from the Fritzing sketch.</p>
<p>Fritzing is a very powerful tool and it is recommended that you spend some time learning how to create your own diagrams with it. This chapter is focused on how to read both the Fritzing and schematic diagrams that are included in this book. If you wish to learn how to use the Fritzing software, their website has a very good tutorial that you can find here: <a href="http://fritzing.org/learning/">http://fritzing.org/learning/</a>. Let's start with the Fritzing diagrams.</p>

<p>A Fritzing diagram is a picture representation of what the circuit should look like, similar to the open, closed and short circuit diagrams previously shown in this chapter; however, the Fritzing diagram has standard symbols to represent each part and a compact design making it easier to design more complex circuits. The following Fritzing diagram shows an Arduino connected to a LED and resistor on a breadboard:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/6b735ddb-6ffe-4c2e-a65a-742444130543.png" style="width:26.00em;height:37.83em;"/></div>
<p>The circuit in this diagram starts with the Arduino GND pin, which is connected to the top rail of the breadboard. The cathode connector of the LED is also connected to the top rail, which connects it to the common ground from the Arduino. The anode connector of the LED is connected to a 220 Ohm resistor, which is connected to the digital 12 pin of the Arduino. This is a pretty easy diagram to understand because the diagrams look like the components themselves. Fritzing diagrams are used a lot when showing diagrams on electronic websites and blogs because it is easier for a beginner to understand how to connect the circuit.</p>
<p>Now let's look at the schematic diagram.</p>

<p>While the Fritzing diagrams used images to represent the circuit, schematic diagrams use symbols. This allows for a more compact diagram, which makes it easier to represent complex circuits. The following diagram shows the symbols for some of the more common electronic components in a schematic diagram:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/802993cc-3d8a-4df5-b2a9-e94081471ba3.png" style="width:23.67em;height:37.83em;"/></div>
<p>We would use these symbols to represent the components in a circuit. To see what a schematic diagram would look like, let's create a simple circuit that contained a battery, resistor and LED. The Fritzing diagram for this circuit would look like this:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/76ecfe21-3362-48a9-a720-46960f5cc4fc.png" style="width:34.25em;height:23.83em;"/></div>
<p>In this diagram, it is easy to see what components are needed and how they are connected; however, in more complex circuits it can be harder to see how everything is connected. The image from the Fritzing diagram also doesn't show the value of the components. A schematic diagram offers a much clearer view of the circuit and if the author of the diagram chooses to, show the values of each component. The following diagram shows the same circuit in a schematic diagram:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/315086a7-82c6-4495-8110-17f1263a6e26.png" style="width:17.67em;height:15.00em;"/></div>
<p>This diagram shows us how the components are connected and all the values of the components. We will be using both Fritzing diagrams and schematic diagrams throughout this book, so we can get familiar with both kinds. Both types of diagrams will be generated from the Fritzing sketches that comes with the downloadable code for this book.</p>

<p>There are two types of circuits that we can create. These are parallel and series circuits. A series circuit is a circuit where current only has one path to flow from the source to the return. A parallel circuit is a circuit that has multiple paths for the current flow. It is important to understand both types of circuits because the properties are different between them. Let's see look at the series circuit first.</p>

<p>The following schematic diagram shows a series circuit:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/65557c93-a2f2-4b04-a78d-f23ad7bb7783.png" style="width:16.42em;height:26.17em;"/></div>
<p>The preceding diagram shows a series circuit where the current only has one path from the source to the return. In this circuit, the load consists of two resistors. One resistor has a value of 330 ohms and the other has a value 220 ohms. Now let's look at several properties of a series circuit.</p>

<p>The total resistance of a series circuit is the sum of the resistance of each component of the load. In the example circuit, the load consists of two resistors with values of 220 ohms and 330 ohms. If we add these two values together we get a total resistance of 550 ohms.</p>

<p>The total voltage of a series circuit is the sum of the voltage of each power source connected in series. In the example circuit, there is only one power source, which is a 9V battery, therefore, the total voltage is 9 volts. If we used 4 AA batteries (1.5 volts each) in series, rather than the 9-volt battery, we would have a total voltage of 6 volts because 1.5V + 1.5V + 1.5V + 1.5V would equal 6 volts.</p>

<p>In a series circuit, the same current flows through each part of the circuit. This means that we can measure the current at any point within the circuit and it will be the same as any other point in the circuit.</p>
<p>In the example circuit, we know the total voltage (9 volts) and we know the total resistance (550 ohms) therefore we can calculate the current of the circuit using Ohm's law, where <em>I</em>=<em>V</em>/<em>R</em>. This formula would give us a current of 9 volts/550 ohms or 0.0164 amps (16.4 milliamps).</p>
<p>Now let's look at the properties of a parallel circuit.</p>

<p>The following schematic diagram shows a parallel circuit:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/ec2b6da7-17a3-41cf-88f6-4d01c938ba84.png" style="width:13.00em;height:24.00em;"/></div>
<p>The preceding diagram shows a parallel circuit where the current has multiple paths to the return. The current can either flow through the branch with the 220-ohm resistor, the branch with the 330-ohm resistor or both branches.</p>
<p>In this sample circuit, as with the series circuit, the load consists of two resistors with values of 330 ohms and 220 ohms, however, this time the resistors are connected in parallel rather than series. The properties of a parallel circuit are very different than the properties of a series circuit. Let's look at these properties.</p>

<p>The total resistance of a parallel circuit will always be less than the total resistance of any branch within the circuit and adding additional branches will always decrease the total resistance of the circuit.</p>
<p>To calculate the total resistance of a parallel circuit, take the sum of the reciprocal of the resistance for each component in the circuit and that equals the reciprocal of the total resistance. Sounds confusing? It really isn't. Here is the formula:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/5ef72779-618a-4c59-a3f6-69f34c4cbf79.png" style="width:15.25em;height:4.25em;"/></div>
<p>This formula will go out to however many resistance values are needed. In the example circuit, there are two resistors with values to 220 ohms and 330 ohms. Therefore, to calculate the resistance of the circuit we would take the reciprocal of 1/220 + 1/330, which would equal 132 ohms.</p>
<p>Rather than trying to calculate the resistance of a parallel circuit by hand, there are plenty of online calculators that you can use.</p>

<p>In a parallel circuit, current will be different in each branch. The total current of the circuit (the current coming out of the power source) will be equal to the sum of the current in each branch. This means that current coming out of the power source will equal the sum of the current running through the 220-ohm resistor branch and the 330-ohm resistor branch.</p>
<p>Let's look at this with Ohm's law to see how this works. To calculate current with Ohm's law we use the formula <em>I</em>=<em>V</em>/<em>R</em>, which means the current equals the voltage divided by the resistance. Earlier, in the resistance section, we calculated that the resistance in the circuit was 132 ohms and we know that the voltage is 9 volts, therefore, the total current will equal 9 volts/132 ohms or 0.0682 amps (68.2 milliamps).</p>
<p>We can also use Ohm's law to calculate the current in each branch knowing that the voltage for each branch will be the same 9 volts. The current in the branch that contains the 220-ohm resistor would be 9 volts/220 ohms or 0.0409 amps (40.9 milliamps). The current in the branch with the 330-ohm resistor would be 9 volts/330 ohms or 0.0273 amps (27.3 milliamps).</p>
<p>We can now add the current from the branch that contains the 220-ohm resistor to the current from the branch that contains the 330-ohm resistor to get the total current of 40.9 milliamps + 27.3 milliamps, which equals the same 68.2 milliamps coming out of the power source.</p>
<p>Now that we understand the difference between parallel and series circuits, there is one more concept we need to understand before we can get started building things. This concept is a voltage drop.</p>

<p>Voltage drop is defined as the amount of voltage lost through each component in the circuit due to impedance. Impedance is the amount of opposition that the circuit and component present to the current flow. We will see why voltage drop is important in the next section where we light up a LED.</p>

<p>Now that we have discussed the basics of electrical circuits, let's build our first circuit. In this circuit, we will simply light up a LED. We will start off with a look at the schematic diagram, which will tell us how to build the circuit:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/a85437f4-772d-4277-8b2e-e6c17fa04c36.png" style="width:21.17em;height:22.50em;"/></div>
<p>In this diagram, we can see that the circuit consists of one 9-volt power source (9-volt battery) one LED and one resistor. One of the first questions people new to circuits ask is how we calculate the value of the resistor. To calculate this value, we need to know what the forward voltage for the LED is and the maximum current it can take without blowing. The forward voltage is the voltage amount required before the LED will conduct electricity and the voltage drop that will occur. If you purchase the LED from a good electronic store, they should have a datasheet that will tell you the forward voltage and the maximum current the LED can take.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">I would recommend writing these items down, so you will have it later when you forget where you purchased the LEDs from.</div>
<p>We use the forward voltage and maximum current in the following formula to figure out what size resistor we need:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/64b414aa-6fd8-4164-b580-07aef0d405cc.png" style="width:9.92em;height:4.75em;"/></div>
<p>In this formula, the voltage marked with the <strong>S</strong> is the voltage source, which is 9V in this example. The voltage and current marked with <strong>LED</strong> is the forward voltage and maximum current, respectively, for the LED. The LED I am using for this example is 3.4 volts and 20 milliamps. This gives a value of (9 - 3.4 volts)/20 milliamps, which are 280 ohms. Since I do not have a resistor with a value of 280 ohms, I rounded it up to the next highest value with is 330 ohms as shown in the schematic.</p>
<p>The following photograph shows how I connected everything:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/0d0f3435-f31e-4cbe-a847-3717ba40f8aa.png" style="width:37.83em;height:28.42em;"/></div>
<p>If you have everything connected correctly the LED will light up when the battery is connected.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we introduced what circuits are and described the differences between closed, open and short circuits. We also showed how to read both a Fritzing and a schematic diagram. We finished the chapter by seeing the differences between parallel and series and creating our first circuit to light up a LED.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will look at how we can prototype circuits and what tools and skills we need.</p>
