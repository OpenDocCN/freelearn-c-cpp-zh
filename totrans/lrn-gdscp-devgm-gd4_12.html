			<h1 id="_idParaDest-296"><a id="_idTextAnchor690"/>Exporting to Multiple Platforms</h1>
			<p>After making a game, we should get it into the hands of players. Games are meant to be played, after all! In the old days, this meant burning thousands to millions of CDs and distributing them all over the world to physical game stores, in the hope people would buy them. This cost tremendous amounts of money and manpower. Big studios would often only see 10% of the profits because the rest dissipated in buying physical CDs and paying distribution and store cuts. Even if you developed a successful hit game, the upfront investment to distribute it could stop it in its tracks.</p>
			<p>With the rise of the internet and <a id="_idIndexMarker738"/>gaming platforms such as <strong class="bold">Steam</strong> and <strong class="bold">Itch.io</strong>, distribution has become <a id="_idIndexMarker739"/>way cheaper, sometimes even free, and easier, with nearly no upfront investment.</p>
			<p>Over the course of this chapter, we’ll learn everything about exporting production builds for our game and even upload it to Itch.io (if you want to).</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Exporting a game for Windows, Mac, and Linux</li>
				<li>Uploading our game to Itch.io</li>
				<li>Exporting our game to other platforms</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-297"><a id="_idTextAnchor691"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>As with every chapter, you can find the final code in the GitHub repository in the subfolder for this chapter: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-GDScript-by-Developing-a-Game-with-Godot-4/tree/main/chapter12">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-GDScript-by-Developing-a-Game-with-Godot-4/tree/main/chapter12</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-298"><a id="_idTextAnchor692"/>Exporting for Windows, Mac, and Linux</h1>
			<p>Exporting is the process where we take the game that we have been developing and make it executable outside of Godot. Yes, we can run our game from the engine’s editor in debug mode, but ideally, we<a id="_idIndexMarker740"/> don’t want to share our game’s code with players. We also don’t want our players to first have to download the whole engine with its editor, and then our game.</p>
			<p>When exporting for computers, we’ll have to do a separate export for each different operating system, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. An operating system is software that manages all the hardware and common functionality of a computer.</p>
			<p>No matter what kind <a id="_idIndexMarker741"/>of <strong class="bold">Operating System</strong> (<strong class="bold">OS</strong>) you use, Windows, Mac, or Linux, Godot allows us to export a game to any other platform. This way, we can easily make exports for all our users, no matter what platform they prefer.</p>
			<p>Before we can export to any platform though, we’ll need to download the export template.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-299"><a id="_idTextAnchor693"/>Downloading the export template</h2>
			<p>To export anything, the Godot engine <a id="_idIndexMarker742"/>uses a template that tells it how to actually export our game, which is unique for each Godot Engine version and called the <strong class="bold">export template</strong>. Once we have the template, we can export to any of the built-in platforms. We can easily download this export template from within the Godot Editor itself, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the top menu bar, open up the <strong class="bold">Editor</strong> dropdown and click on <strong class="bold">Manage Export </strong><strong class="bold">Templates...</strong> .</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 12.1 – The export templates manager can be accessed through the Editor drop-down menu" src="img/B19358_12_1.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.1 – The export templates manager can be accessed through the Editor drop-down menu</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Click <strong class="bold">Download </strong><strong class="bold">and Install</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 12.2 – In the export template manager, we can download and install export templates" src="img/B19358_12_2.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.2 – In the export template manager, we can download and install export templates</p>
			<p>It will take some time to <a id="_idIndexMarker743"/>download and install the export template, but you only need to do this once for each Godot Engine version you are using. Now, we are ready to do a proper export.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-300"><a id="_idTextAnchor694"/>Making the actual exports of the game</h2>
			<p>With the export template for our<a id="_idIndexMarker744"/> given Godot Engine version in place, we can finally export the game. We’ll do this using the <strong class="bold">Export menu</strong>. Let’s get cracking:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the top menu bar, open up the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> dropdown and click on <strong class="bold">Export...</strong>.</li>

			<ol>
				<li value="6">Now, click <strong class="bold">Export Project...</strong> to export the game.</li>
				<li>Create a new folder called <code>exports</code>, under which you can create a folder for each platform. So, if you <a id="_idIndexMarker747"/>export for Windows, put it under <code>exports/windows</code>. This is just to give some structure to our exports.</li>
				<li>Disable the <strong class="bold">Export With </strong><strong class="bold">Debug</strong> option.</li>

			<p>We’ll now have an export of the game for the target platform in the folder we just created. Repeat the steps in this section for each platform.</p>

			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">You might have noticed there is also a button called <strong class="bold">Export All...</strong> in the export menu. When all the platforms you want to export to are set up, you can press this button to export all of them simultaneously.</p>
			<p>After exporting, it’s time<a id="_idIndexMarker748"/> to publish the game and share it with the world.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-301"><a id="_idTextAnchor695"/>Uploading our game to Itch.io</h1>
			<p>After making a game, it is a lot of fun to <a id="_idIndexMarker749"/>share it with people you know or total strangers to see them interact and play with what you made. In this section, we’ll go through the process of putting the game on an online platform called Itch.io. If you don’t want to share your game for any reason, then you can skip this section for now; just return to it when you feel ready. But don’t worry too much whether it is too early or not to share a game. Player feedback is always a good thing, no matter what point of development you are at, and following these steps to create an Itch.io page is great practice too.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-302"><a id="_idTextAnchor696"/>What is Itch.io?</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Itch.io</strong> is an online platform <a id="_idIndexMarker750"/>and store where people can distribute games, assets (to make games), or any other digital resource, file, or program. It is very well known in the game development community because a lot of developers put their small game experiments on there, but you can also find bigger projects.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 12.10 – The Itch.io front page" src="img/B19358_12_11.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.10 – The Itch.io front page</p>
			<p>Itch.io is also the place to be to participate in <strong class="bold">game jams</strong>. A game jam is a little online event where you build a game within a certain time<a id="_idIndexMarker751"/> limit around a certain theme. The time limit and theme differ from <a id="_idIndexMarker752"/>game jam to game jam. Afterward, everyone who participated plays each other’s games and gives feedback. It is a great way to practice creating games and get feedback from other game developers.</p>
			<p>We’ll upload our computer builds to the Itch.io platform, but the cool thing is that we can also upload a web build that will be playable from within the browser so that people don’t have to download any files – they can just start playing. If we upload both the normal exports and the web export, people can still choose how they want to play, which gives them more options.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-303"><a id="_idTextAnchor697"/>Exporting our game to the web</h2>
			<p>Exporting to the web means that we <a id="_idIndexMarker753"/>make an export that can be included in any website and is playable from any browser, even mobile ones.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Note that when we make a web export, it will only be playable when it is run through a server. You will not be able to directly open the export in your favorite browser without running a server on your computer or hosting it on an online platform. Luckily, we are going to host our game on Itch.io, so you will be able to play it over there.</p>
			<p>The first thing we need <a id="_idIndexMarker754"/>to do is take out the multiplayer aspect of the game for now.</p>
			<h3>Removing multiplayer</h3>
			<p>For security reasons, a website should never have full access to your computer. That is why web exports have some limits, such as slightly worse performance and networking. This means that our game’s multiplayer will not <a id="_idIndexMarker755"/>work in the web export. There are ways to get multiplayer to work for web exports, but these are out of the scope of this book. With just one small change it will still work fine for a single player:</p>
			<p>In the <code>_ready()</code> function of the <code>menu.gd</code> script, add the following line:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
func _ready():
   <strong class="bold">_ip_address_line_edit.visible = OS.get_name() != "Web"</strong>
   # Rest of the _ready function</pre>			<p>The <code>OS.get_name()</code> function gives us the name of the operating system the game is currently running on. This makes sure that the input field for the IP address is not visible anymore when the player is playing on the web and cannot get stuck trying to connect, which could break the game for them.</p>
			<p>With the multiplayer disables, let’s see how we can make the web export.</p>
			<h3>Making the actual web export</h3>
			<p>The process of making a <a id="_idIndexMarker756"/>web export is equally easy as exporting to the computer platforms; we just add a new preset for the <strong class="bold">Web</strong> platform and export the project as normal.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 12.11 – Adding an export preset for the Web platform" src="img/figure_12.11.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.11 – Adding an export preset for the Web platform</p>
			<p>One thing that we’ll have to <a id="_idIndexMarker757"/>ensure is that, when saving the file, we name it <code>index.html</code>, as demonstrated in <em class="italic">Figure 12</em><em class="italic">.12</em>. Itch.io requires this name because it will be looking for an <code>index.html</code> file to run the game in the browser.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 12.12 – Make sure you save the web export as index.html" src="img/B19358_12_13.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.12 – Make sure you save the web export as index.html</p>
			<p>Now that we have the export, we’ll need to make a zip file out of it. Let’s learn how to do that.</p>
			<h3>Zipping the web export</h3>
			<p>Itch.io will require a ZIP file that contains all the exported files for the web export. A ZIP  file is a file that bundles multiple other files into a compressed format, making it easier to transport them as well as making the content smaller.</p>
			<p>Depending on the platform you <a id="_idIndexMarker758"/>use, the process is a little different.</p>
			<p>For Windows and macOS, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Select all the export files.</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 12.13 – Selecting all the exported files" src="img/B19358_12_14.jpg"/>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.13 – Selecting all the exported files</p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.15 – On macOS platforms, select Compress</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Now, name the<a id="_idIndexMarker760"/> ZIP file <code>Survivor </code><code>Game Web</code>.</li>

			<p>For Linux, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open the Terminal application on your computer.</li>
				<li>Use the <code>cd ~/path/to/game/export/folder</code> command, with the correct path, to navigate to the web export folder of the game.</li>
				<li>Now, run <code>zip -r "Survivor Game Web.zip" .</code> to create a ZIP file with the contents of this folder.</li>

			<p>With all the exports ready <a id="_idIndexMarker761"/>and zipped, it is time to upload the game to Itch.io.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-304"><a id="_idTextAnchor698"/>Uploading to Itch.io</h2>
			<p>Now that everything is ready, we<a id="_idIndexMarker762"/> can upload our game to the Itch.io <a id="_idIndexMarker763"/>platform and create our own page from which people can play and download the game:</p>

			<p>We know how to do the basic exports for most computers and the web, but what about other platforms, such as mobile and consoles? Let’s look at that next.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-305"><a id="_idTextAnchor699"/>Exporting our game to other platforms</h1>
			<p>Now that our game is published and everyone can play it, let’s take a quick look at how to export to other platforms that are not regular computers.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-306"><a id="_idTextAnchor700"/>Mobile platforms</h2>
			<p>For mobile devices, such as Android <a id="_idIndexMarker778"/>and iOS devices, the process is a little more intricate. However, once the process is set up, it will be very reliable. You can find guides<a id="_idIndexMarker779"/> to export to mobile platforms in the official Godot Engine documentation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Exporting to Android: <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_for_android.html">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_for_android.html</a></li>
				<li>Exporting to iOS: <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_for_ios.html">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_for_ios.html</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Next to simply exporting the game, you’ll<a id="_idIndexMarker780"/> also need to account for the fact that mobile devices, mostly, don’t have external buttons, so the gameplay should account for touchscreen controls.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-307"><a id="_idTextAnchor701"/>Consoles</h2>
			<p>Let’s address the elephant in<a id="_idIndexMarker781"/> the room – what about <a id="_idIndexMarker782"/>exporting to consoles, such as <strong class="bold">PlayStation</strong>, <strong class="bold">Xbox</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Nintendo</strong> consoles?</p>
			<p>Well, the good <a id="_idIndexMarker783"/>news is that it is <a id="_idIndexMarker784"/>possible! The bad news is that because the Godot Engine is open source and the code libraries that are needed to export to these consoles are closed source, export options for<a id="_idIndexMarker785"/> these cannot be included in the base Godot version. So, by default, they are not in the engine.</p>
			<p>However, there are companies that provide a specialized Godot Engine version to export to consoles and/or help port a whole game. These companies include <strong class="bold">W4</strong> (a company <a id="_idIndexMarker786"/>that employs many of the original <a id="_idIndexMarker787"/>Godot Engine developers), <strong class="bold">Pineapple Works</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Lone Wolf Technology</strong>. You can find an up-to-date list on the Godot documentation site: <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/platform/consoles.html">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/platform/consoles.html</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-308"><a id="_idTextAnchor702"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we learned how to export our game to multiple computer platforms such as Windows, Mac, and Linux. We also saw how we can export for the web and upload the game to Itch.io. Now, we are ready to create a whole game and publish it!</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we’ll learn more advanced techniques in object-ori<a id="_idTextAnchor703"/>ented programming.</p>
