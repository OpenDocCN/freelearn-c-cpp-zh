- en: The book begins by exploring common myths about C++ and debunking them. You
    will gain insight into the history of C++ and develop an understanding of the
    zero-overhead principle. In addition, you will examine design challenges in embedded
    systems and learn how to address them using C++. This part also covers the embedded
    C++ ecosystem and guides you through setting up the development environment for
    a C++ embedded project, including configuring the toolchain, build system, and
    simulator.
