<p>What is a real-time system and what are the major components that make up a <strong>real-time operating system</strong> (<strong>RTOS</strong>)? These are the questions we'll be answering in the first section of this book. This prerequisite knowledge will serve as a foundation we'll build upon with working examples and hands-on exercises in later chapters. If you're already familiar with another RTOS, you can probably skim or skip this section. </p>
