- en: C++ is a general-purpose programming language built with a bias towards embedded
    programming and systems programming. Over the years, C++ has evolved and is used
    to develop software for many different sectors. Given its versatility and robustness,
    C++ is a wonderful language to start your coding journey with. This book covers
    exciting projects built in C++ that show how to implement the language in different
    scenarios. While developing these projects, you will not only learn the language
    constructs but also how you can use C++ to meet your software requirements.

- en: '[Chapter 1](f654f53f-736c-4b83-8918-d619a31a7e58.xhtml), *Getting Started with
    C++*, introduces you to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++. We start by
    looking into a simple program that rolls a dice. We write the code, compile, link,
    and execute the program. We then continue by constructing a simple object-oriented
    hierarchy, with pointers and dynamic binding. Finally, we create two simple abstract
    data types: stack and queue. The stack is a set of values ordered in a bottom-to-top
    manner, where only the top-most value is accessible, while the queue is a traditional
    queue where we inspect values at the front and add values at the rear.'

    Algorithms*, builds on what was learned in the previous chapter, especially the
    list and set abstract datatypes. We also introduce templates and operator overloading,
    and we look into linear and binary search algorithms and the insert, select, bubble,
    merge, and quicksort algorithms.'

    Management System*, will help you develop a real-world system: a library management
    system that is made up of books and customers. The books keep track of the customers
    that have borrowed and reserved them, and the customers keep track of the books
    they have borrowed and reserved.'

    System with Pointers*, further develops the library management system. In the
    previous chapter, each book and customer were identified by integer numbers. In
    this chapter, however, we work with pointers. Each book holds pointers to the
    customers that have borrowed or reserved it, and each customer holds pointers
    to the books they have borrowed or reserved.'

    dives into three graphical applications that we develop with the Qt graphical
    library: an analog clock with hour, minute, and second hands, a drawing program
    that draws lines, rectangles, and ellipses in different colors, and an editor
    where the user can input and edit text. We will learn how to handle windows and
    widgets as well as menus and toolbars in the Qt Library. We will also learn how
    to draw figures and write text, and how to catch mouse and keyboard input.'

    analog clock, the drawing program, and the editor. We add digits to the clock
    dial, we add the possibility to move, modify, and cut-and-paste figures in the
    drawing program, and we add the possibility to change font and text alignment
    in the editor.'

    you to basic game development. In this chapter, we develop the games Othello,
    and Noughts and Crosses with the Qt library. In Othello, two players take turn
    adding marks, colored black and white, to the game grid in order to enclose the
    opponent''s marks. In Noughts and Crosses, two players take turns adding noughts
    and crosses to a game grid in order to place five marks in a row.'

    empowers the computer to play against a human player. In Othello, the computer
    tries to add marks that enclose as many as possible of the opponent’s marks. In
    Nought and Crosses, the computer tries to add marks to obtain five marks in a
    row, and to prevent the opponent to get five marks in a row.'

    teaches you to develop a Domain-Specific Language (DSL), which is a language intended
    for a specific domain. More specifically, we develop a language for writing graphical
    objects in a Qt widget. We start by formally defining our language with a grammar.
    We then write a scanner that recognizes meaningful sequences of characters, a
    parser that checks that the source code complies with the grammar, and a viewer
    that displays the graphical objects.'

    and iteration that alter the flow of the program, we add variables that can be
    assigned to values during the program execution, and we add functions with parameters
    and a return value.'
