# Section 1: Introduction and RTOS Concepts

What is a real-time system and what are the major components that make up a **real-time operating system** (**RTOS**)? These are the questions we'll be answering in the first section of this book. This prerequisite knowledge will serve as a foundation we'll build upon with working examples and hands-on exercises in later chapters. If you're already familiar with another RTOS, you can probably skim or skip this section.
