			<p>To best understand the example code in this book, you should have a general knowledge of programming, preferably with a modern, dynamically-typed language such as Python or JavaScript. If you’re new to programming entirely, you may wish to review a beginner tutorial before diving into the game <span class="No-Break">projects here.</span></p>
			<p>Godot will run on any relatively modern PC running Windows, MacOS, or Linux <span class="No-Break">operating systems.</span></p>
