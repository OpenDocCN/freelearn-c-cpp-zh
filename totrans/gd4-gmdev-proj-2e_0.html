			<p>This book is an introduction to the Godot game engine and its new version, 4. Godot 4 has a large number of new features and capabilities that make it a strong alternative to expensive commercial game engines. For beginners, it offers a friendly way to learn game development techniques. For more experienced developers, Godot is a powerful, customizable tool for bringing visions to life.</p>
			<p>This book takes a project-based approach to learning how to use Godot. It consists of five projects, along with additional resources, that will help developers achieve a sound understanding of how to use Godot to build games.</p>
