			<h1 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor208"/>Next Steps and Additional Resources</h1>
			<p>Congratulations! The projects you’ve built in this book have started you on the road to becoming a Godot expert. However, you’ve only just scratched the surface of what’s possible in Godot. As you become more proficient and the sizes of your projects grow, you’ll need to know how to find solutions to your problems, how to distribute your games so they can be played, and even how to extend the engine yourself.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you’ll learn about the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How to effectively use Godot’s built-in documentation</li>
				<li>Using <strong class="bold">Git</strong> to back up and manage your project files</li>
				<li>An overview of some of the vector math concepts you’ll encounter in most game projects</li>
				<li>Using <strong class="bold">Blender</strong>, an open source 3D modeling application, to make 3D objects you can use in Godot</li>
				<li>Exporting projects to run on other platforms</li>
				<li>An introduction to shaders</li>
				<li>Using other programming languages in Godot</li>
				<li>Community resources where you can get help</li>
				<li>Becoming a Godot contributor</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This chapter will help you move on from the book’s projects and begin making your own games. You can use the information here to find additional resources and guidance, as well as some more advanced topics that didn’t fit in with the beginner projects covered earlier.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor209"/>Using Godot’s documentation</h1>
			<p>Learning Godot’s API can seem overwhelming at first. How can you learn about all the different nodes and the properties and methods each one contains? Fortunately, Godot’s built-in documentation<a id="_idIndexMarker524"/> is there to help you. Develop the habit of using it often: it will help you find things when you’re learning, but it’s also a great way to quickly look up a method or property for reference once you know your way around.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Leveling up your skills</p>
			<p class="callout">Learning to effectively use API documentation is the number one thing you can do to dramatically boost your skill level. Keep a docs tab open in your web browser while you’re working and reference it often, looking up the nodes and/or functions you’re using.</p>
			<p>When you are in the <strong class="bold">Script</strong> tab of the editor, you’ll see the following buttons in the upper-right corner:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19289_07_01.jpg" alt="Figure 7.1: Documentation buttons"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.1: Documentation buttons</p>
			<p>The <code>position</code>, you can take a look at the <code>Vector2</code> document and see all of the functions available for that data type.</p>
			<p>The other button allows <a id="_idIndexMarker525"/>you to view the documentation directly in the Godot editor. Clicking <strong class="bold">Search Help</strong> lets you search for any method or property name. The search is <em class="italic">smart</em>, meaning you can type part of a word and the results will be narrowed down as you type. Take a look at the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19289_07_02.jpg" alt="Figure 7.2: Searching for help"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.2: Searching for help</p>
			<p>When you find the property or method you’re looking for, click <strong class="bold">Open</strong> and the documentation reference for that node will appear.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor210"/>Reading the API documentation</h2>
			<p>When you’ve <a id="_idIndexMarker526"/>found the documentation for the node you want, you’ll see that it follows a common format, with the name of the node at the top followed by several subsections of information, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19289_07_03.jpg" alt="Figure 7.3: API documentation"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.3: API documentation</p>
			<p>At the<a id="_idIndexMarker527"/> top of the page is a list called <code>Object</code>, which is Godot’s base object class. For example, <code>Area2D</code> has the following inheritance chain:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
  CollisionObject2D &lt; Node2D &lt; CanvasItem &lt; Node &lt; Object</pre>
			<p>This lets you quickly see what other properties this type of object may have. For example, an <code>Area2D</code> node has a <code>position</code> property because that property is defined by <code>Node2D</code> – any node that inherits from <code>Node2D</code> will also have a position in 2D space. You can click on any of the node names to jump to that node’s documentation.</p>
			<p>You can also see a list of what node types, if any, inherit from that particular node, as well as a general description of the node. Below that, you can see the member variables and methods of the node. The names of most methods and types are links, so you can click on any item to read more about it. Note that these names and descriptions are the same ones that show when you hover over a property in the Inspector.</p>
			<p>Develop the habit of consulting the API documentation regularly as you’re working. You’ll find that you will quickly begin to develop a stronger understanding of how everything works together.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-212"><a id="_idTextAnchor211"/>Version control – using Git with Godot</h1>
			<p>It happens <a id="_idIndexMarker528"/>to everyone – at a certain point, you’ll make a mistake. You’ll accidentally delete a file or just change some code in a way that breaks everything, but you can’t figure out how to get back to the working version.</p>
			<p>The solution to this <a id="_idIndexMarker529"/>problem is <strong class="bold">version control software</strong> (<strong class="bold">VCS</strong>). The most popular VCS, used by developers all over the world, is Git. When you use Git with your projects, every change you make is tracked, allowing you to “rewind” time at any point and recover from unwanted changes.</p>
			<p>Fortunately, Godot is very VCS-friendly. All the content of your game is kept in the project folder. Scenes, scripts, and resources are all saved in a human-readable text format that is easy for Git to track.</p>
			<p>Git is typically used via a command-line interface, but there are graphical clients you can use as well. There is also a Git plugin available in <a id="_idIndexMarker530"/>Godot’s <strong class="bold">AssetLib</strong> that you can try.</p>
			<p>In any case, the basic workflow can be broken down into two steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Add</strong> the files you want to track.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Commit</strong> the changes you have made.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In addition, you can use a website such as GitHub or GitLab to store and share your Git-based projects. This is a common way that developers collaborate on projects – indeed, the entire Godot source code is stored and managed on GitHub. If you’re doing this, you’ll have a third step: <strong class="bold">pushing</strong> your committed changes to the remote repository.</p>
			<p>Most developers use the command-line version of Git, which you can install from your OS package manager or download directly from <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a>. There are also many GUI interfaces, such as Git Kraken or GitHub Desktop.</p>
			<p>The details of using Git are beyond the scope of this book, but here is an example of the most basic usage: creating and updating a repository to save your changes. All of these steps will be done using your computer’s terminal or command-line interface:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Create a new Git repository in your project folder. Navigate to the folder and type the following:<pre class="source-code">
~/project_folder/$ git init</pre></li>
				<li>After working on your project, add the new and/or updated files to the repository by typing the following:<pre class="source-code">
~/project_folder/$ git add *</pre></li>
				<li>Commit your changes, creating a “checkpoint” in time that you can rewind to if necessary:<pre class="source-code">
~/project_folder/$ git commit -m "short description"</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Repeat <a id="_idIndexMarker531"/>steps 2 and 3 every time you add a new feature or make changes to your project.</p>
			<p>Make sure to type something descriptive in the commit message. If you need to rewind to a certain point in your project’s history, it will help you identify the change you are looking for.</p>
			<p>There’s a lot more to Git than just the above. You can create branches – multiple versions of your game’s code, collaborate with others making changes at the same time, and much more. Here are some suggestions of where you can learn more about how to use Git with your projects:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources">https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources</a><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources "/></li>
				<li><em class="italic">Mastering Git</em> (book) by Jakub Narębski</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It may seem hard at first – Git has a difficult learning curve – but it is a skill that will serve you well, and you’ll really appreciate it the first time it saves you from a disaster! You may even find that Git is helpful with your non-game projects as well.</p>
			<p>In the next section, you’ll see how to use the popular Blender modeling tool to create 3D objects and use them in Godot.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-213"><a id="_idTextAnchor212"/>Using Blender with Godot</h1>
			<p>Blender <a id="_idIndexMarker532"/>is a <a id="_idIndexMarker533"/>very popular open source 3D modeling and animation program (it does a lot of other things too). If you’re planning on making a 3D game and you need to make items, characters, and environments for your game, Blender is probably your best option for doing so.</p>
			<p>The most common workflow is to export glTF files from Blender and import them into Godot. This is a stable and reliable workflow and will work well in most situations.</p>
			<p>When you<a id="_idIndexMarker534"/> export a glTF file, you have two options: glTF binary (<code>.glb</code>) and glTF text (<code>.gltf</code>). The binary version is more compact and is therefore the preferred format, but either will work fine.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-214"><a id="_idTextAnchor213"/>Import hints</h2>
			<p>It’s common <a id="_idIndexMarker535"/>to import meshes from Blender and then make modifications such as adding collisions or removing unneeded nodes. To simplify this, you can add suffixes to the names of your objects to give Godot a hint about how you want them to be processed on import. Here are some examples:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>-noimp</code> – These objects will be removed from the imported scene.</li>
				<li><code>-col</code>, <code>-convcol</code>, <code>-colonly</code> – These options tell Godot to make a collision shape from the named mesh. The first two options make a child triangle mesh or convex polygon shape, respectively. The <code>-colonly</code> option will remove the mesh entirely and replace it with a <code>StaticBody3D</code> collision.</li>
				<li><code>-rigid</code> – This object will be imported as a <code>RigidBody3D</code>.</li>
				<li><code>-loop</code> – Blender animations with this suffix will be imported with the loop option enabled.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>See the documentation for more details on all the possible import suffixes.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-215"><a id="_idTextAnchor214"/>Using blend files</h2>
			<p>With<a id="_idIndexMarker536"/> Godot 4, you have an additional option: importing <code>.blend</code> files directly into your Godot project. In order to use this feature, you need to have Blender installed on the same computer you’re using for Godot.</p>
			<p>To set it up, open <strong class="bold">Editor Settings</strong> and look under <strong class="bold">FileSystem</strong> | <strong class="bold">Import</strong>. Here, you can set the path where you’ve installed Blender.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19289_07_04.jpg" alt="Figure 7.4: Setting up Blender support"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.4: Setting up Blender support</p>
			<p>Click the <a id="_idIndexMarker537"/>folder icon to browse to your Blender location. Once you’ve set this value, you can drop your <code>.blend</code> files directly into your Godot project folder. This can make prototyping and iterating your designs much faster. You can open Blender, save a change to the design, and then when you tab back to Godot, you’ll instantly see it updated.</p>
			<p>Blender is an important tool to learn if you plan on making 3D games. Because of its open source nature, it’s a great fit for working with Godot. While its learning curve can be challenging, investing time in learning it will give you a huge benefit when designing and building 3D games.</p>
			<p>Now that you’ve explored how to import external content into your game project, the next section will explain how you can export your game to run on other systems, such as mobile devices, PCs, or the web.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-216"><a id="_idTextAnchor215"/>Exporting projects</h1>
			<p>Eventually, your <a id="_idIndexMarker538"/>project will reach the stage where you want to share it with the world. Exporting your project means converting it into a package that can be run by someone who doesn’t have the Godot editor. You can export your project to a number of popular platforms.</p>
			<p>Godot supports the following target platforms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Android (mobile)</li>
				<li>iOS (mobile)</li>
				<li>Linux</li>
				<li>macOS</li>
				<li>HTML5 (web)</li>
				<li>Windows Desktop</li>
				<li>UWP (Windows Universal)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The requirements<a id="_idIndexMarker539"/> for exporting a project vary depending on the platform you are targeting. For example, to export to iOS, you must be running on a macOS computer with Xcode installed.</p>
			<p>Each platform is unique, and some features of your game may not work on some platforms because of hardware limitations, screen size, or other factors. As an example, if you wanted to export the <em class="italic">Coin Dash</em> game for an Android phone, your player wouldn’t be able to move because the user wouldn’t have a keyboard! For that platform, you would need to include touchscreen controls in your game’s code (more about this later).</p>
			<p>Every platform is unique, and there are many factors to consider when configuring your project for export. Consult the official documentation for the latest instructions on exporting to your desired platform.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Exporting for consoles</p>
			<p class="callout">While it’s perfectly possible for Godot games to run on consoles such as Switch or Xbox, the process is more complex. Console companies such as Nintendo and Microsoft require the developer to sign a contract that includes a secrecy clause. That means that, while you can make your game run on the console, you can’t share the code you wrote to make it work publicly. If you do plan to release your game on a console platform, you’ll either need to do that work yourself or partner with a company that has already entered such an agreement.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-217"><a id="_idTextAnchor216"/>Getting the export templates</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Export templates</strong> are<a id="_idIndexMarker540"/> versions of Godot that are compiled for each target platform but don’t include the editor. Your project will be combined with the target platform’s template to create a standalone application.</p>
			<p>To begin, you must download the export templates. Select <strong class="bold">Manage Export Templates</strong> from the <strong class="bold">Editor</strong> menu:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19289_07_05.jpg" alt="Figure 7.5: Manage Export Templates"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.5: Manage Export Templates</p>
			<p>In this window, you can click <strong class="bold">Download and Install</strong> to fetch the export templates matching the version of Godot you are using. If you’re running multiple versions of Godot for some reason, you’ll see the other versions listed in the window.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-218"><a id="_idTextAnchor217"/>Export presets</h2>
			<p>When you’re ready<a id="_idIndexMarker541"/> to export your project, click on <strong class="bold">Project</strong> | <strong class="bold">Export</strong>.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19289_07_06.jpg" alt="Figure 7.6: Export settings"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.6: Export settings</p>
			<p>In this window, you <a id="_idIndexMarker542"/>can create <strong class="bold">presets</strong> for each platform by clicking <strong class="bold">Add…</strong> and selecting the platform from the list. You can make as many presets for each platform as you wish. For example, you may want to create both “debug” and “release” versions of your projects.</p>
			<p>Each platform has its own settings and options – too many to describe here. The default values are typically good, but you should test them thoroughly before distributing the project. Consult the official documentation at <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/">https://docs.godotengine.org/</a> for details.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-219"><a id="_idTextAnchor218"/>Exporting</h2>
			<p>There are<a id="_idIndexMarker543"/> two export buttons at the bottom of the export window. The first button, <strong class="bold">Export PCK/ZIP…</strong>, will only create a PCK, or packed, version of your project’s data. This doesn’t include an executable, so the game can’t be run on its own. This method is useful if you need to provide add-ons, updates, or <strong class="bold">downloadable content</strong> (<strong class="bold">DLC</strong>) for <a id="_idIndexMarker544"/>your game.</p>
			<p>The second button, <code>exe</code> for Windows or an .<code>apk</code> for Android.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19289_07_07.jpg" alt="Figure 7.7: Export dialog"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.7: Export dialog</p>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker545"/>next dialog, you can choose where to save your exported project. Take note of the <strong class="bold">Export with Debug</strong> checkbox, which is checked by default. You’ll want to disable this when it is time to export the final, released version of your game.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-220"><a id="_idTextAnchor219"/>Exporting for specific platforms</h2>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker546"/> exact steps and requirements for exporting vary depending on your target platform. For example, exporting to desktop platforms (Windows, MacOS, Linux) is very straightforward and will work without any additional configuration.</p>
			<p>Exporting on mobile platforms, however, can be more complex. To export for Android, for example, you’ll need to install Google’s Android Studio and configure it correctly. The detailed requirements can change regularly as mobile platforms update, so you should check the Godot documentation at this link for the most accurate information: <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/export/">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/export/</a> </p>
			<p>Once you’ve configured the platforms you wish to export, the window will look like this:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19289_07_08.jpg" alt="Figure 7.8: Ready to export"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.8: Ready to export</p>
			<p>Godot’s <a id="_idIndexMarker547"/>export system is comprehensive and robust. You can manage multiple versions, export different features for different platforms, and many other options. While it may seem complex at first, remember that the complexity mostly comes from the rules of a particular platform. It’s best if you practice with desktop platforms first before attempting to work with mobile.</p>
			<p>In the next section, you’ll learn about how visual effects are implemented using a special type of program called a shader.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-221"><a id="_idTextAnchor220"/>Introduction to shaders</h1>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">shader</strong> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker548"/> program that is designed to run on the GPU and alters the way that objects appear on the screen. Shaders are used extensively in both 2D and 3D development to create a variety of visual effects. They are called shaders because they were originally used for shading and lighting effects, but today they are used for a wide variety of visual effects. Because they run in the GPU in <em class="italic">parallel</em>, they are very fast but also come with some restrictions.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Learning more</p>
			<p class="callout">This section<a id="_idIndexMarker549"/> is a very brief introduction to the concept of shaders. For a more in-depth understanding, see <a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/">https://thebookofshaders.com/</a><a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/"/> and Godot’s shader documentation at <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/shaders/"/>.</p>
			<p>Earlier in <a id="_idIndexMarker550"/>this book, when you added a <code>StandardMaterial3D</code> to a mesh, you were actually adding a shader – one that’s pre-configured and built into Godot. It’s great for many common situations, but sometimes you need something more specific, and for that, you’ll need to write shader code.</p>
			<p>In Godot, you’ll write shaders in a language very similar to GLSL ES 3.0. If you are familiar with C-style languages, you’ll find the syntax very similar. If you are not, it may look strange to you at first. See the end of this section for links to further resources where you can learn more.</p>
			<p>Shaders in <a id="_idIndexMarker551"/>Godot come in several types:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">spatial</strong> (for 3D rendering)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">canvas_item</strong> (for 2D rendering)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">particles</strong> (for rendering particle effects)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">sky</strong> (for rendering 3D sky materials)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">fog</strong> (for rendering volumetric fog effects)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker552"/> first<a id="_idIndexMarker553"/> line of your shader must declare which<a id="_idIndexMarker554"/> of <a id="_idIndexMarker555"/>these types you are writing. Typically, this will be automatically filled in for you when you add a shader to a particular type of node.</p>
			<p>After determining the type of shader, you can then choose what phase(s) of the rendering process you want to affect:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Fragment</strong> shaders <a id="_idIndexMarker556"/>are used to set the color of all affected pixels</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Vertex</strong> shaders <a id="_idIndexMarker557"/>can modify the vertices of a shape or mesh, changing its apparent shape</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Light</strong> shaders <a id="_idIndexMarker558"/>are applied to alter the way light is processed for an object</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For each of these three shader types, you will write code that will be run <em class="italic">simultaneously</em> on every affected item. This is where the real power of shaders comes from. For example, when using a fragment shader, the code is run on every pixel of the object at the same time. This is a very different process than what you might be used to using a traditional language, where you would loop over each pixel one at a time. That kind of sequential code just isn’t fast enough to handle the huge number of pixels modern games need to process.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">The importance of the GPU</p>
			<p class="callout">Consider a game running at the relatively low resolution of 480 x 720 – a typical phone resolution. The total number of pixels on the screen is almost 350,000. Any manipulation of those pixels in code must happen in less than 1/60 of a second to avoid lag – even less when you consider the rest of your code that also has to run on every frame: game logic, animation, networking, and everything else. This is why GPUs are so important, especially for high-end games that may be processing millions of pixels each and every frame.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-222"><a id="_idTextAnchor221"/>Creating a 2D shader</h2>
			<p>To <a id="_idIndexMarker559"/>demonstrate<a id="_idIndexMarker560"/> some shader effects, create a scene with a <code>Sprite2D</code> node and choose any texture you like. This demo will use the player image from <em class="italic">Coin Dash</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19289_07_09.jpg" alt="Figure 7.9: Player sprite"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.9: Player sprite</p>
			<p>A<a id="_idIndexMarker561"/> shader <a id="_idIndexMarker562"/>can be added to any <code>CanvasItem</code> derived node – in this case, <code>Sprite2D</code>, via its <strong class="bold">Material</strong> property. In this property, select <strong class="bold">New ShaderMaterial</strong> and click on the newly created resource.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19289_07_10.jpg" alt="Figure 7.10: Adding a shader material"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.10: Adding a shader material</p>
			<p>The first property is <strong class="bold">Shader</strong>, where you can choose <strong class="bold">New Shader</strong>. When you do, a <strong class="bold">Create Shader</strong> panel appears.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19289_07_11.jpg" alt="Figure 7.11: Create Shader options"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.11: Create Shader options</p>
			<p>Note<a id="_idIndexMarker563"/> that <code>.gdshader</code>. Click <strong class="bold">Create</strong> and then you can click your new shader to edit it in <a id="_idIndexMarker564"/>the bottom panel.</p>
			<p>Your new shader has the following code by default:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
shader_type canvas_item;
void fragment() {
    // Place fragment code here.
}</pre>
			<p>Shader functions have a number of <code>TEXTURE</code> input built-in contains the pixel data of the object’s texture, while the <code>COLOR</code> output built-in is used to set the pixel color. Remember, the code in the fragment shader will affect the color of every processed pixel.</p>
			<p>When working with shaders in the <code>TEXTURE</code> property, for example, coordinates are measured in a <em class="italic">normalized</em> (that is, ranging from 0 to 1) coordinate space. This coordinate space is called <code>UV</code> to distinguish it from the x/y coordinate space.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19289_07_12.jpg" alt="Figure 7.12: UV coordinate space"/>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.12: UV coordinate space</p>
			<p>As a <a id="_idIndexMarker565"/>very small example, our first shader will change the color <a id="_idIndexMarker566"/>of each pixel in the image based on its <code>UV</code> position.</p>

			<p>As soon as you do this, you’ll see the entire image change to a gradient of red and green. What happened? Look at the preceding UV image – as we move from left to right, the<a id="_idIndexMarker567"/> red value increases from 0 to 1, and the green does the same from bottom to top.</p>
			<p>Let’s try another example. This time, to allow you to choose the color, you can use a <code>uniform</code> variable.</p>
			<p>Uniforms<a id="_idIndexMarker568"/> allow you to pass data into the shader from outside. Declaring a <code>uniform</code> variable will cause it to appear in the Inspector (similar to the way <code>@export</code> works in GDScript) and also allows you to set it via code:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
shader_type canvas_item;
uniform vec4 fill_color : source_color;
void fragment() {
    COLOR = fill_color;
}</pre>
			<p>You’ll see that <strong class="bold">Fill Color</strong> has appeared under <strong class="bold">Shader Parameters</strong> in the Inspector, and you can change its value.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19289_07_14.jpg" alt="Figure 7.14: Shader Parameters"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.14: Shader Parameters</p>
			<p>Why did the entire rectangle of the image change color in these examples? Because the output <code>COLOR</code> is applied to every pixel. Our player image has transparent pixels surrounding it, so we can ignore those by not changing the pixel’s <code>a</code> value:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
COLOR.rgb = fill_color.rgb;</pre>
			<p>Now we <a id="_idIndexMarker569"/>can <a id="_idIndexMarker570"/>change the color of the object. Let’s turn it into a “hit” effect so that we can make the object flash whenever it’s hit:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
shader_type canvas_item;
uniform vec4 fill_color : source_color;
uniform bool active = false;
void fragment() {
    if (active == true) {
        COLOR.rgb = fill_color.rgb;
    }
}</pre>
			<p>Note that now you can toggle the color on and off by clicking the <code>uniform</code> variables appear in the <code>AnimationPlayer</code> that animates these values for your visual effect.</p>
			<p>Here’s another example. This time, we’ll create an outline around the image:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
shader_type canvas_item;
uniform vec4 line_color : source_color;
uniform float line_thickness : hint_range(0, 10) = 0.5;
void fragment() {
    vec2 size = TEXTURE_PIXEL_SIZE * line_thickness;
    float outline = texture(TEXTURE, UV + vec2(-size.x,
        0)).a;
    outline += texture(TEXTURE, UV + vec2(0, size.y)).a;
    outline += texture(TEXTURE, UV + vec2(size.x, 0)).a;
    outline += texture(TEXTURE, UV + vec2(0, -size.y)).a;
    outline = min(outline, 1.0);
    vec4 color = texture(TEXTURE, UV);
    COLOR = mix(color, line_color, outline - color.a);
}</pre>
			<p>In this<a id="_idIndexMarker571"/> shader, we have a lot more going on. We’re using the built-in <code>TEXTURE_PIXEL_SIZE</code> to get the normalized size of each pixel (its size <a id="_idIndexMarker572"/>compared to the size of the image). Then, we get a float value that “adds up” how transparent the pixels on all four sides of the image are. Finally, we use the <code>mix()</code> function to combine the original pixel’s color with the line color based on that outline value.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19289_07_15.jpg" alt="Figure 7.15: Outline shader"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.15: Outline shader</p>
			<p>An important thing to note – did you notice that the outline did not go below the character’s feet? This is because an object’s shader can only affect the pixels of that image. Since the character’s feet in this image are on the edge, there are no pixels available below them that can be affected by the shader. It’s important to keep this in mind when working on 2D shader effects. If you’re creating 2D art, leave a border of a few pixels around the image to prevent clipping at the edges.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-223"><a id="_idTextAnchor222"/>3D shaders</h2>
			<p>Let’s<a id="_idIndexMarker573"/> try one <a id="_idIndexMarker574"/>3D shader so you can see how the vertex() shader works. In a new scene, add a <code>MeshInstance3D</code> with a <code>PlaneMesh</code> shape. So that you can see the vertices better, select <strong class="bold">Display Wireframe</strong> from the <strong class="bold">Perspective</strong> menu.</p>
			<p>Click the <strong class="bold">Mesh</strong> resource to expand it and add a new shader in the <strong class="bold">Material</strong> property, just like you did previously.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19289_07_16.jpg" alt="Figure 7.16: Adding a shader to the plane"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.16: Adding a shader to the plane</p>
			<p>Since we’re using a plane shape, we have four vertices: the four corners of the shape. The <code>vertex()</code> function will apply an effect to each of these vertices. For example, adding to their <code>y</code> value <a id="_idIndexMarker575"/>would move them all upward.</p>
			<p>Let’s start with this code:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
shader_type spatial;
void vertex() {
    VERTEX.y += sin(10.0 * UV.x) * 0.5;
}</pre>
			<p>Note <a id="_idIndexMarker576"/>that we’re using a <code>spatial</code> type shader now, since our node is a <code>Node3D</code>.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19289_07_17.jpg" alt="Figure 7.17: Shifting the vertices"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.17: Shifting the vertices</p>
			<p>It doesn’t look like much changed – the two vertices in the +X direction moved down a little bit. But <code>UV.x</code> is only either <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>, so the <code>sin()</code> function doesn’t have much to do. To see more variation, we need to add more vertices. In the mesh properties, change both <code>32</code>.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19289_07_18.jpg" alt="Figure 7.18: Working with more vertices"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.18: Working with more vertices</p>
			<p>Now we <a id="_idIndexMarker577"/>can see much more variation in the effect, as the different vertices along the <em class="italic">x</em> axis are moved up or down in a smooth sine wave.</p>
			<p>For one <a id="_idIndexMarker578"/>more fun effect, let’s use the <code>TIME</code> built-in to animate the effect. Change the code to this:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
VERTEX.y += sin(TIME + 10.0 * UV.x) * 0.5;</pre>
			<p>Take some time to experiment with this. Don’t be afraid to try things – experimentation is a great way to become more comfortable with how shaders work.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-224"><a id="_idTextAnchor223"/>Learning more</h2>
			<p>Shaders are capable of an amazing range of effects. Experimenting with Godot’s shader language is a great way to learn the basics. The best place to start is with the shader section of<a id="_idIndexMarker579"/> Godot’s documentation:</p>
			<p><a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/shaders/">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/shaders/</a></p>
			<p>There is also a wealth of resources on the internet for learning more. When learning about shaders, you can use resources that aren’t specific to Godot, and you shouldn’t have much trouble getting them to work in Godot. The concept is the same across all types of graphics applications.</p>
			<p>In addition, Godot’s documentation includes a page on converting shaders from other popular sources into Godot’s version of GLSL.</p>
			<p>To see <a id="_idIndexMarker580"/>some examples of just how powerful shaders can be, visit <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">https://www.shadertoy.com/</a>.</p>
			<p>This section was only a brief introduction to the in-depth topic of shaders and shader effects. While it can be a very challenging subject to master, the power it gives you makes it well worth the effort.</p>
			<p>In the next section, you’ll see how it’s possible to use other programming languages with Godot.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-225"><a id="_idTextAnchor224"/>Using other programming languages in Godot</h1>
			<p>The projects in this book have all been written using GDScript. GDScript has a number of advantages that make it the best choice for building your games. It is very tightly integrated with Godot’s API, and its Python-style syntax makes it useful for rapid development while also being very beginner-friendly.</p>
			<p>It’s not the only option, however. Godot also supports two other “official” scripting languages and also provides tools for integrating code using a variety of other languages.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-226"><a id="_idTextAnchor225"/>C#</h2>
			<p>C# is <a id="_idIndexMarker581"/>very popular in game development, and the Godot version is based on the .NET 6.0 framework. Because of its wide use, there are many resources available for learning C# and a great deal of existing code in the language for accomplishing a variety of game-related functions.</p>
			<p>At the time<a id="_idIndexMarker582"/> of writing, Godot version 4.0 is still relatively new. Features are being added and bugs are being fixed continuously, so see the C# documentation at this link to get the latest information: <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/index.html">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/index.html</a></p>
			<p>If you want to try out the C# implementation, you’ll need to first make sure you have the .NET SDK installed, which you can get from <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download">https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download</a>. You must also download the Godot version that has C# support included, which you can find at <a href="http://godotengine.org/download">http://godotengine.org/download</a>, where it is <a id="_idIndexMarker583"/>labeled <strong class="bold">Godot Engine - .</strong><strong class="bold">NET</strong>.</p>
			<p>You’ll also need to use an external editor – such as Visual Studio Code or MonoDevelop – that provides more debugging and language functionality than Godot’s built-in editor. You can set this in <strong class="bold">Editor Settings</strong> under the <strong class="bold">Dotnet</strong> section.</p>
			<p>To <a id="_idIndexMarker584"/>attach a C# script to a node, select the language from the <strong class="bold">Attach Node </strong><strong class="bold">Script</strong> dialog:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19289_07_19.jpg" alt="Figure 7.19: Create script dialog"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.19: Create script dialog</p>
			<p>In general, scripting in C# works very much the same as what you’ve already done in GDScript. The main difference is that the API functions are renamed in PascalCase to follow C# standards instead of the snake_case that’s standard for GDScript.</p>
			<p>There are also a number of existing C# libraries that you may find useful in building your game. Things such as procedural generation, artificial intelligence, or other intensive topics may be easier to implement using available C# libraries.</p>
			<p>Here’s an example of CharacterBody2D movement in C#. Compare this with the movement script in <em class="italic">Jungle Jump</em>:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
using Godot;
public partial class MyCharacterBody2D : CharacterBody2D
{
    private float _speed = 100.0f;
    private float _jumpSpeed = -400.0f;
    // Get the gravity from the project settings so you can
       sync with rigid body nodes.
    public float Gravity = ProjectSettings.GetSetting(
        "physics/2d/default_gravity").AsSingle();
    public override void _PhysicsProcess(double delta)
    {
        Vector2 velocity = Velocity;
        // Add the gravity.
        velocity.Y += Gravity * (float)delta;
        // Handle jump.
        if (Input.IsActionJustPressed("jump") &amp;&amp;
        IsOnFloor())
            velocity.Y = _jumpSpeed;
        // Get the input direction.
        Vector2 direction = Input.GetAxis("ui_left",
            "ui_right");
        velocity.X = direction * _speed;
        Velocity = velocity;
        MoveAndSlide();
    }
}</pre>
			<p>For more<a id="_idIndexMarker585"/> details about setting up and using C#, see the <strong class="bold">Scripting</strong> section of the documentation linked above.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-227"><a id="_idTextAnchor226"/>Other languages – GDExtension</h2>
			<p>There are many programming languages to choose from. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, as well as its fans who prefer to use it over other options. While it doesn’t make sense to support every language directly in Godot, there are situations where GDScript is not sufficient to solve a particular problem. Perhaps you want to use an existing external library, or you’re doing something computationally intensive – such as AI or procedural world generation – that it doesn’t make sense to write in GDScript.</p>
			<p>Because GDScript is an interpreted language, it trades performance for flexibility. This means that for some processor-intensive code, it can run unacceptably slow. In this case, the highest performance would be achieved by running native code written in a compiled language. In this situation, you can move that code to GDExtension.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">GDExtension</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker586"/>technology that opens up the same API available to GDScript and C#, making it possible to write code in other languages that talks to Godot. By default, it works directly with C and C++, but by using <strong class="bold">third-party bindings</strong>, you <a id="_idIndexMarker587"/>can use it with many other languages.</p>
			<p>At the time of writing, several projects are available that use GDExtension to allow you to use other languages for scripting. These include C, C++, Rust, Python, Nim, and others. While these additional language bindings are still relatively new at the time of writing, they each have a dedicated group of developers working on them. If you’re interested in using a particular language with Godot, a Google search of “godot + &lt;language name&gt;” will help you find what’s available.</p>
			<p>Working with other programming languages is certainly not required for just about any game project you may encounter, so don’t feel that it’s something you need to learn if it’s foreign to you. It’s presented here for those to whom it might be useful, and it’s something to keep in mind if you have a preferred language you’d like to work with.</p>
			<p>In the next section, you can explore the community resources that are available for you to learn more about how Godot works, find examples, and even get help with your own projects.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-228"><a id="_idTextAnchor227"/>Getting help – community resources</h1>
			<p>Godot’s online<a id="_idIndexMarker588"/> community is one of its strengths. Because of its open source nature, there is a wide variety of people working together to improve the engine, write documentation, and help each other with issues.</p>
			<p>You can find a list of official community resources at <a href="https://godotengine.org/community">https://godotengine.org/community</a>. These links may change over time, but the following are the main community resources you should be aware of:</p>

			<p>As illustrated by <a id="_idIndexMarker597"/>this section, one of the great strengths of the Godot Engine is its community. The resources listed here, along with many others, are built by the community of Godot users who are passionate about the engine and about helping others. In the next section, you<a id="_idTextAnchor229"/> can find out how you can contribute to Godot as well.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-230"><a id="_idTextAnchor230"/>Contributing to Godot</h1>
			<p>Godot is an open source, community-driven project. All of the work that’s done to build, test, document, and otherwise support Godot is done primarily by passionate individuals contributing their time and skills. For the majority of contributors, it is a labor of love, and they take pride in helping to build something of quality that people enjoy using.</p>
			<p>In order for Godot to continue growing and improving, there is always a need for more members of the community to step up and contribute. There are many ways you can help out, regardless of your skill level or the amount of time you can commit.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-231"><a id="_idTextAnchor231"/>Contributing to the engine</h2>
			<p>There <a id="_idIndexMarker598"/>are two main ways you can directly contribute to Godot’s development. If you visit <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot">https://github.com/godotengine/godot</a>, you can see Godot’s source code, as well as finding out exactly what’s being worked on. Click the <strong class="bold">Clone</strong> or <strong class="bold">Download</strong> button, and you’ll have the up-to-the-minute source code and can test out the latest features. You’ll need to build the engine, but don’t be intimidated: Godot is one of the easiest open source projects to compile that you’ll find. See <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/development/compiling/index.html">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/development/compiling/index.html</a> for instructions.</p>
			<p>If you’re not able to actually contribute to the C++ code, go to the <strong class="bold">Issues</strong> tab, where you can report or read about bugs and suggestions for improvements. There is always a need for people to confirm bug reports, test fixes, and give their opinions on new features.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-232"><a id="_idTextAnchor232"/>Writing documentation</h2>
			<p>Godot’s <a id="_idIndexMarker599"/>official documentation is only as good as its community’s contributions. From something as small as correcting a typo to writing an entire tutorial, all levels of help are very welcome. The home of the official documentation is <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs">https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs</a>.</p>
			<p>Hopefully, by now, you’ve taken some time to browse through the official documentation and get an idea of what’s available. If you spot something wrong or something missing, open an issue at the aforementioned GitHub link. If you’re comfortable with using GitHub, you can even go ahead and submit a pull request yourself. Just make sure you read all the guidelines first so that your contribution will be accepted. You can find the guidelines at <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/ways_to_contribute.html">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/ways_to_contribute.html</a>.</p>
			<p>If you speak<a id="_idIndexMarker600"/> a language other than English, translations are also very much needed and will be greatly appreciated by Godot’s non-English-speaking users. See <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/documentation/editor_and_docs_localization">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/documentation/editor_and_docs_localization</a> for how to contribute in your language.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-233"><a id="_idTextAnchor233"/>Donations</h2>
			<p>Godot is a<a id="_idIndexMarker601"/> not-for-profit project, and user donations go a long way to help pay for hosting costs and development resources, such as hardware. Financial contributions also allow the project to pay core developers, allowing them to dedicate themselves part- or full-time to working on the engine.</p>
			<p>The easiest way to contribute to Godot is via the donation page at <a href="https://godotengine.org/donate">https://godotengine.org/donate</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-234"><a id="_idTextAnchor234"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you learned about a few additional topics that will help you continue to level up your Godot skills. Godot has a great many features in addition to those explored in this book. You’ll need to know where to look and where to ask for help as you move on to working on projects of your own.</p>
			<p>You also learned about some more advanced topics, such as working with other programming languages and using shaders to enhance your game’s visual effects.</p>
			<p>In addition, since Godot is built by its community, you learned how you could participate and become part of the team that is making it one of the fastest-growing projects of its kind.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-235"><a id="_idTextAnchor235"/>Final words</h1>
			<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this book. I hope you found it useful in starting your game development journey with Godot. The goal of this book was not to give you a “copy-and-paste” solution to making games but rather to help you develop an intuition for the process of game development. As you’ll see when you explore other resources, there are often many ways to solve a problem, and there may not be a single “right” answer. It’s up to you as a developer to evaluate and determine what works for you in your situation. I wish you luck in your future game projects, and I hope to play them sometime in the future!</p>
