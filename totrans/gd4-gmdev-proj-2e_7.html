			<h1 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor208"/>Next Steps and Additional Resources</h1>
			<p>Congratulations! The projects you’ve built in this book have started you on the road to becoming a Godot expert. However, you’ve only just scratched the surface of what’s possible in Godot. As you become more proficient and the sizes of your projects grow, you’ll need to know how to find solutions to your problems, how to distribute your games so they can be played, and even how to extend the <span class="No-Break">engine yourself.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, you’ll learn about the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>How to effectively use Godot’s <span class="No-Break">built-in documentation</span></li>
				<li>Using <strong class="bold">Git</strong> to back up and manage your <span class="No-Break">project files</span></li>
				<li>An overview of some of the vector math concepts you’ll encounter in most <span class="No-Break">game projects</span></li>
				<li>Using <strong class="bold">Blender</strong>, an open source 3D modeling application, to make 3D objects you can use <span class="No-Break">in Godot</span></li>
				<li>Exporting projects to run on <span class="No-Break">other platforms</span></li>
				<li>An introduction <span class="No-Break">to shaders</span></li>
				<li>Using other programming languages <span class="No-Break">in Godot</span></li>
				<li>Community resources where you can <span class="No-Break">get help</span></li>
				<li>Becoming a <span class="No-Break">Godot contributor</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This chapter will help you move on from the book’s projects and begin making your own games. You can use the information here to find additional resources and guidance, as well as some more advanced topics that didn’t fit in with the beginner projects <span class="No-Break">covered earlier.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor209"/>Using Godot’s documentation</h1>
			<p>Learning Godot’s API can seem overwhelming at first. How can you learn about all the different nodes and the properties and methods each one contains? Fortunately, Godot’s built-in documentation<a id="_idIndexMarker524"/> is there to help you. Develop the habit of using it often: it will help you find things when you’re learning, but it’s also a great way to quickly look up a method or property for reference once you know your <span class="No-Break">way around.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Leveling up your skills</p>
			<p class="callout">Learning to effectively use API documentation is the number one thing you can do to dramatically boost your skill level. Keep a docs tab open in your web browser while you’re working and reference it often, looking up the nodes and/or functions <span class="No-Break">you’re using.</span></p>
			<p>When you are in the <strong class="bold">Script</strong> tab of the editor, you’ll see the following buttons in the <span class="No-Break">upper-right corner:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer162" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19289_07_01.jpg" alt="Figure 7.1: Documentation buttons"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.1: Documentation buttons</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Online Docs</strong> button will open the documentation website in your browser. If you have a multimonitor setup, it can be very useful to keep the API reference open on one side for quick reference while you’re working in Godot. For example, if you’re working with a node’s <strong class="source-inline">position</strong>, you can take a look at the <strong class="source-inline">Vector2</strong> document and see all of the functions available for that <span class="No-Break">data type.</span></p>
			<p>The other button allows <a id="_idIndexMarker525"/>you to view the documentation directly in the Godot editor. Clicking <strong class="bold">Search Help</strong> lets you search for any method or property name. The search is <em class="italic">smart</em>, meaning you can type part of a word and the results will be narrowed down as you type. Take a look at the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer163" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19289_07_02.jpg" alt="Figure 7.2: Searching for help"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.2: Searching for help</p>
			<p>When you find the property or method you’re looking for, click <strong class="bold">Open</strong> and the documentation reference for that node <span class="No-Break">will appear.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor210"/>Reading the API documentation</h2>
			<p>When you’ve <a id="_idIndexMarker526"/>found the documentation for the node you want, you’ll see that it follows a common format, with the name of the node at the top followed by several subsections of information, as shown in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer164" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19289_07_03.jpg" alt="Figure 7.3: API documentation"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.3: API documentation</p>
			<p>At the<a id="_idIndexMarker527"/> top of the page is a list called <strong class="bold">Inherits</strong>, which shows the chain of classes that a particular node is built from, all the way back to <strong class="source-inline">Object</strong>, which is Godot’s base object class. For example, <strong class="source-inline">Area2D</strong> has the following <span class="No-Break">inheritance chain:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
  CollisionObject2D &lt; Node2D &lt; CanvasItem &lt; Node &lt; Object</pre>
			<p>This lets you quickly see what other properties this type of object may have. For example, an <strong class="source-inline">Area2D</strong> node has a <strong class="source-inline">position</strong> property because that property is defined by <strong class="source-inline">Node2D</strong> – any node that inherits from <strong class="source-inline">Node2D</strong> will also have a position in 2D space. You can click on any of the node names to jump to that <span class="No-Break">node’s documentation.</span></p>
			<p>You can also see a list of what node types, if any, inherit from that particular node, as well as a general description of the node. Below that, you can see the member variables and methods of the node. The names of most methods and types are links, so you can click on any item to read more about it. Note that these names and descriptions are the same ones that show when you hover over a property in <span class="No-Break">the Inspector.</span></p>
			<p>Develop the habit of consulting the API documentation regularly as you’re working. You’ll find that you will quickly begin to develop a stronger understanding of how everything <span class="No-Break">works together.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-212"><a id="_idTextAnchor211"/>Version control – using Git with Godot</h1>
			<p>It happens <a id="_idIndexMarker528"/>to everyone – at a certain point, you’ll make a mistake. You’ll accidentally delete a file or just change some code in a way that breaks everything, but you can’t figure out how to get back to the <span class="No-Break">working version.</span></p>
			<p>The solution to this <a id="_idIndexMarker529"/>problem is <strong class="bold">version control software</strong> (<strong class="bold">VCS</strong>). The most popular VCS, used by developers all over the world, is Git. When you use Git with your projects, every change you make is tracked, allowing you to “rewind” time at any point and recover from <span class="No-Break">unwanted changes.</span></p>
			<p>Fortunately, Godot is very VCS-friendly. All the content of your game is kept in the project folder. Scenes, scripts, and resources are all saved in a human-readable text format that is easy for Git <span class="No-Break">to track.</span></p>
			<p>Git is typically used via a command-line interface, but there are graphical clients you can use as well. There is also a Git plugin available in <a id="_idIndexMarker530"/>Godot’s <strong class="bold">AssetLib</strong> that you <span class="No-Break">can try.</span></p>
			<p>In any case, the basic workflow can be broken down into <span class="No-Break">two steps:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Add</strong> the files you want <span class="No-Break">to track.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Commit</strong> the changes you <span class="No-Break">have made.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In addition, you can use a website such as GitHub or GitLab to store and share your Git-based projects. This is a common way that developers collaborate on projects – indeed, the entire Godot source code is stored and managed on GitHub. If you’re doing this, you’ll have a third step: <strong class="bold">pushing</strong> your committed changes to the <span class="No-Break">remote repository.</span></p>
			<p>Most developers use the command-line version of Git, which you can install from your OS package manager or download directly from <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a>. There are also many GUI interfaces, such as Git Kraken or <span class="No-Break">GitHub Desktop.</span></p>
			<p>The details of using Git are beyond the scope of this book, but here is an example of the most basic usage: creating and updating a repository to save your changes. All of these steps will be done using your computer’s terminal or <span class="No-Break">command-line interface:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Create a new Git repository in your project folder. Navigate to the folder and type <span class="No-Break">the following:</span><pre class="source-code">
~/project_folder/$ git init</pre></li>
				<li>After working on your project, add the new and/or updated files to the repository by typing <span class="No-Break">the following:</span><pre class="source-code">
~/project_folder/$ git add *</pre></li>
				<li>Commit your changes, creating a “checkpoint” in time that you can rewind to <span class="No-Break">if necessary:</span><pre class="source-code">
~/project_folder/$ git commit -m "short description"</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Repeat <a id="_idIndexMarker531"/>steps 2 and 3 every time you add a new feature or make changes to <span class="No-Break">your project.</span></p>
			<p>Make sure to type something descriptive in the commit message. If you need to rewind to a certain point in your project’s history, it will help you identify the change you are <span class="No-Break">looking for.</span></p>
			<p>There’s a lot more to Git than just the above. You can create branches – multiple versions of your game’s code, collaborate with others making changes at the same time, and much more. Here are some suggestions of where you can learn more about how to use Git with <span class="No-Break">your projects:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources"><span class="No-Break">https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources</span></a><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources "/></li>
				<li><em class="italic">Mastering Git</em> (book) by <span class="No-Break">Jakub Narębski</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>It may seem hard at first – Git has a difficult learning curve – but it is a skill that will serve you well, and you’ll really appreciate it the first time it saves you from a disaster! You may even find that Git is helpful with your non-game projects <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></p>
			<p>In the next section, you’ll see how to use the popular Blender modeling tool to create 3D objects and use them <span class="No-Break">in Godot.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-213"><a id="_idTextAnchor212"/>Using Blender with Godot</h1>
			<p>Blender <a id="_idIndexMarker532"/>is a <a id="_idIndexMarker533"/>very popular open source 3D modeling and animation program (it does a lot of other things too). If you’re planning on making a 3D game and you need to make items, characters, and environments for your game, Blender is probably your best option for <span class="No-Break">doing so.</span></p>
			<p>The most common workflow is to export glTF files from Blender and import them into Godot. This is a stable and reliable workflow and will work well in <span class="No-Break">most situations.</span></p>
			<p>When you<a id="_idIndexMarker534"/> export a glTF file, you have two options: glTF binary (<strong class="source-inline">.glb</strong>) and glTF text (<strong class="source-inline">.gltf</strong>). The binary version is more compact and is therefore the preferred format, but either will <span class="No-Break">work fine.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-214"><a id="_idTextAnchor213"/>Import hints</h2>
			<p>It’s common <a id="_idIndexMarker535"/>to import meshes from Blender and then make modifications such as adding collisions or removing unneeded nodes. To simplify this, you can add suffixes to the names of your objects to give Godot a hint about how you want them to be processed on import. Here are <span class="No-Break">some examples:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">-noimp</strong> – These objects will be removed from the <span class="No-Break">imported scene.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">-col</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">-convcol</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">-colonly</strong> – These options tell Godot to make a collision shape from the named mesh. The first two options make a child triangle mesh or convex polygon shape, respectively. The <strong class="source-inline">-colonly</strong> option will remove the mesh entirely and replace it with a <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">StaticBody3D</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> collision.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">-rigid</strong> – This object will be imported as <span class="No-Break">a </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">RigidBody3D</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">-loop</strong> – Blender animations with this suffix will be imported with the loop <span class="No-Break">option enabled.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>See the documentation for more details on all the possible <span class="No-Break">import suffixes.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-215"><a id="_idTextAnchor214"/>Using blend files</h2>
			<p>With<a id="_idIndexMarker536"/> Godot 4, you have an additional option: importing <strong class="source-inline">.blend</strong> files directly into your Godot project. In order to use this feature, you need to have Blender installed on the same computer you’re using <span class="No-Break">for Godot.</span></p>
			<p>To set it up, open <strong class="bold">Editor Settings</strong> and look under <strong class="bold">FileSystem</strong> | <strong class="bold">Import</strong>. Here, you can set the path where you’ve <span class="No-Break">installed Blender.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer165" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19289_07_04.jpg" alt="Figure 7.4: Setting up Blender support"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.4: Setting up Blender support</p>
			<p>Click the <a id="_idIndexMarker537"/>folder icon to browse to your Blender location. Once you’ve set this value, you can drop your <strong class="source-inline">.blend</strong> files directly into your Godot project folder. This can make prototyping and iterating your designs much faster. You can open Blender, save a change to the design, and then when you tab back to Godot, you’ll instantly see <span class="No-Break">it updated.</span></p>
			<p>Blender is an important tool to learn if you plan on making 3D games. Because of its open source nature, it’s a great fit for working with Godot. While its learning curve can be challenging, investing time in learning it will give you a huge benefit when designing and building <span class="No-Break">3D games.</span></p>
			<p>Now that you’ve explored how to import external content into your game project, the next section will explain how you can export your game to run on other systems, such as mobile devices, PCs, or <span class="No-Break">the web.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-216"><a id="_idTextAnchor215"/>Exporting projects</h1>
			<p>Eventually, your <a id="_idIndexMarker538"/>project will reach the stage where you want to share it with the world. Exporting your project means converting it into a package that can be run by someone who doesn’t have the Godot editor. You can export your project to a number of <span class="No-Break">popular platforms.</span></p>
			<p>Godot supports the following <span class="No-Break">target platforms:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Android (mobile)</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">iOS (mobile)</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Linux</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">macOS</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">HTML5 (web)</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Windows Desktop</span></li>
				<li>UWP (<span class="No-Break">Windows Universal)</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The requirements<a id="_idIndexMarker539"/> for exporting a project vary depending on the platform you are targeting. For example, to export to iOS, you must be running on a macOS computer with <span class="No-Break">Xcode installed.</span></p>
			<p>Each platform is unique, and some features of your game may not work on some platforms because of hardware limitations, screen size, or other factors. As an example, if you wanted to export the <em class="italic">Coin Dash</em> game for an Android phone, your player wouldn’t be able to move because the user wouldn’t have a keyboard! For that platform, you would need to include touchscreen controls in your game’s code (more about <span class="No-Break">this later).</span></p>
			<p>Every platform is unique, and there are many factors to consider when configuring your project for export. Consult the official documentation for the latest instructions on exporting to your <span class="No-Break">desired platform.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Exporting for consoles</p>
			<p class="callout">While it’s perfectly possible for Godot games to run on consoles such as Switch or Xbox, the process is more complex. Console companies such as Nintendo and Microsoft require the developer to sign a contract that includes a secrecy clause. That means that, while you can make your game run on the console, you can’t share the code you wrote to make it work publicly. If you do plan to release your game on a console platform, you’ll either need to do that work yourself or partner with a company that has already entered such <span class="No-Break">an agreement.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-217"><a id="_idTextAnchor216"/>Getting the export templates</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Export templates</strong> are<a id="_idIndexMarker540"/> versions of Godot that are compiled for each target platform but don’t include the editor. Your project will be combined with the target platform’s template to create a <span class="No-Break">standalone application.</span></p>
			<p>To begin, you must download the export templates. Select <strong class="bold">Manage Export Templates</strong> from the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Editor</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> menu:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer166" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19289_07_05.jpg" alt="Figure 7.5: Manage Export Templates"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.5: Manage Export Templates</p>
			<p>In this window, you can click <strong class="bold">Download and Install</strong> to fetch the export templates matching the version of Godot you are using. If you’re running multiple versions of Godot for some reason, you’ll see the other versions listed in <span class="No-Break">the window.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-218"><a id="_idTextAnchor217"/>Export presets</h2>
			<p>When you’re ready<a id="_idIndexMarker541"/> to export your project, click on <strong class="bold">Project</strong> | <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Export</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer167" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19289_07_06.jpg" alt="Figure 7.6: Export settings"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.6: Export settings</p>
			<p>In this window, you <a id="_idIndexMarker542"/>can create <strong class="bold">presets</strong> for each platform by clicking <strong class="bold">Add…</strong> and selecting the platform from the list. You can make as many presets for each platform as you wish. For example, you may want to create both “debug” and “release” versions of <span class="No-Break">your projects.</span></p>
			<p>Each platform has its own settings and options – too many to describe here. The default values are typically good, but you should test them thoroughly before distributing the project. Consult the official documentation at <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/">https://docs.godotengine.org/</a> <span class="No-Break">for details.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-219"><a id="_idTextAnchor218"/>Exporting</h2>
			<p>There are<a id="_idIndexMarker543"/> two export buttons at the bottom of the export window. The first button, <strong class="bold">Export PCK/ZIP…</strong>, will only create a PCK, or packed, version of your project’s data. This doesn’t include an executable, so the game can’t be run on its own. This method is useful if you need to provide add-ons, updates, or <strong class="bold">downloadable content</strong> (<strong class="bold">DLC</strong>) for <a id="_idIndexMarker544"/><span class="No-Break">your game.</span></p>
			<p>The second button, <strong class="bold">Export Project…</strong>, will create an executable version of your game, such as an .<strong class="source-inline">exe</strong> for Windows or an .<strong class="source-inline">apk</strong> <span class="No-Break">for Android.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer168" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19289_07_07.jpg" alt="Figure 7.7: Export dialog"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.7: Export dialog</p>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker545"/>next dialog, you can choose where to save your exported project. Take note of the <strong class="bold">Export with Debug</strong> checkbox, which is checked by default. You’ll want to disable this when it is time to export the final, released version of <span class="No-Break">your game.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-220"><a id="_idTextAnchor219"/>Exporting for specific platforms</h2>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker546"/> exact steps and requirements for exporting vary depending on your target platform. For example, exporting to desktop platforms (Windows, MacOS, Linux) is very straightforward and will work without any <span class="No-Break">additional configuration.</span></p>
			<p>Exporting on mobile platforms, however, can be more complex. To export for Android, for example, you’ll need to install Google’s Android Studio and configure it correctly. The detailed requirements can change regularly as mobile platforms update, so you should check the Godot documentation at this link for the most accurate information: <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/export/">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/export/</a> </p>
			<p>Once you’ve configured the platforms you wish to export, the window will look <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer169" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19289_07_08.jpg" alt="Figure 7.8: Ready to export"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.8: Ready to export</p>
			<p>Godot’s <a id="_idIndexMarker547"/>export system is comprehensive and robust. You can manage multiple versions, export different features for different platforms, and many other options. While it may seem complex at first, remember that the complexity mostly comes from the rules of a particular platform. It’s best if you practice with desktop platforms first before attempting to work <span class="No-Break">with mobile.</span></p>
			<p>In the next section, you’ll learn about how visual effects are implemented using a special type of program called <span class="No-Break">a shader.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-221"><a id="_idTextAnchor220"/>Introduction to shaders</h1>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">shader</strong> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker548"/> program that is designed to run on the GPU and alters the way that objects appear on the screen. Shaders are used extensively in both 2D and 3D development to create a variety of visual effects. They are called shaders because they were originally used for shading and lighting effects, but today they are used for a wide variety of visual effects. Because they run in the GPU in <em class="italic">parallel</em>, they are very fast but also come with <span class="No-Break">some restrictions.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Learning more</p>
			<p class="callout">This section<a id="_idIndexMarker549"/> is a very brief introduction to the concept of shaders. For a more in-depth understanding, see <a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/">https://thebookofshaders.com/</a><a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/"/> and Godot’s shader documentation <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/shaders/"/><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Earlier in <a id="_idIndexMarker550"/>this book, when you added a <strong class="source-inline">StandardMaterial3D</strong> to a mesh, you were actually adding a shader – one that’s pre-configured and built into Godot. It’s great for many common situations, but sometimes you need something more specific, and for that, you’ll need to write <span class="No-Break">shader code.</span></p>
			<p>In Godot, you’ll write shaders in a language very similar to GLSL ES 3.0. If you are familiar with C-style languages, you’ll find the syntax very similar. If you are not, it may look strange to you at first. See the end of this section for links to further resources where you can <span class="No-Break">learn more.</span></p>
			<p>Shaders in <a id="_idIndexMarker551"/>Godot come in <span class="No-Break">several types:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">spatial</strong> (for <span class="No-Break">3D rendering)</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">canvas_item</strong> (for <span class="No-Break">2D rendering)</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">particles</strong> (for rendering <span class="No-Break">particle effects)</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">sky</strong> (for rendering 3D <span class="No-Break">sky materials)</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">fog</strong> (for rendering volumetric <span class="No-Break">fog effects)</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker552"/> first<a id="_idIndexMarker553"/> line of your shader must declare which<a id="_idIndexMarker554"/> of <a id="_idIndexMarker555"/>these types you are writing. Typically, this will be automatically filled in for you when you add a shader to a particular type <span class="No-Break">of node.</span></p>
			<p>After determining the type of shader, you can then choose what phase(s) of the rendering process you want <span class="No-Break">to affect:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Fragment</strong> shaders <a id="_idIndexMarker556"/>are used to set the color of all <span class="No-Break">affected pixels</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Vertex</strong> shaders <a id="_idIndexMarker557"/>can modify the vertices of a shape or mesh, changing its <span class="No-Break">apparent shape</span></li>

			</ul>
			<p>For each of these three shader types, you will write code that will be run <em class="italic">simultaneously</em> on every affected item. This is where the real power of shaders comes from. For example, when using a fragment shader, the code is run on every pixel of the object at the same time. This is a very different process than what you might be used to using a traditional language, where you would loop over each pixel one at a time. That kind of sequential code just isn’t fast enough to handle the huge number of pixels modern games need <span class="No-Break">to process.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">The importance of the GPU</p>
			<p class="callout">Consider a game running at the relatively low resolution of 480 x 720 – a typical phone resolution. The total number of pixels on the screen is almost 350,000. Any manipulation of those pixels in code must happen in less than 1/60 of a second to avoid lag – even less when you consider the rest of your code that also has to run on every frame: game logic, animation, networking, and everything else. This is why GPUs are so important, especially for high-end games that may be processing millions of pixels each and <span class="No-Break">every frame.</span></p>

			<p>To <a id="_idIndexMarker559"/>demonstrate<a id="_idIndexMarker560"/> some shader effects, create a scene with a <strong class="source-inline">Sprite2D</strong> node and choose any texture you like.

			<p>A<a id="_idIndexMarker561"/> shader <a id="_idIndexMarker562"/>can be added to any <strong class="source-inline">CanvasItem</strong> derived node – in this case, <strong class="source-inline">Sprite2D</strong>, via its <strong class="bold">Material</strong> property. In this property, select <strong class="bold">New ShaderMaterial</strong> and click on the newly <span class="No-Break">created resource.</span></p>

			<p>Note<a id="_idIndexMarker563"/> that <strong class="bold">Mode</strong> is already showing the correct shader type, but you’ll need to supply a filename for the shader. By default, Godot shader files end in <strong class="source-inline">.gdshader</strong>. Click <strong class="bold">Create</strong> and then you can click your new shader to edit it in <a id="_idIndexMarker564"/>the <span class="No-Break">bottom panel.</span></p>
			<p>Your new shader has the following code <span class="No-Break">by default:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
shader_type canvas_item;
void fragment() {
    // Place fragment code here.
}</pre>
			<p>Shader functions have a number of <strong class="bold">built-ins</strong>, which are either input values or output values. For example, the <strong class="source-inline">TEXTURE</strong> input built-in contains the pixel data of the object’s texture, while the <strong class="source-inline">COLOR</strong> output built-in is used to set the pixel color. Remember, the code in the fragment shader will affect the color of every <span class="No-Break">processed pixel.</span></p>
			<p>When working with shaders in the <strong class="source-inline">TEXTURE</strong> property, for example, coordinates are measured in a <em class="italic">normalized</em> (that is, ranging from 0 to 1) coordinate space. This coordinate space is called <strong class="source-inline">UV</strong> to distinguish it from the x/y <span class="No-Break">coordinate space.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer173" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19289_07_12.jpg" alt="Figure 7.12: UV coordinate space"/>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.12: UV coordinate space</p>
			<p>As a <a id="_idIndexMarker565"/>very small example, our first shader will change the color <a id="_idIndexMarker566"/>of each pixel in the image based on its <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">UV</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> position.</span></p>
			<p>Type the following code into the <strong class="bold">Shader </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Editor</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> panel:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
shader_type canvas_item;
void fragment() {
COLOR = vec4(UV.x, UV.y, 0.0, 1.0);
}</pre>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer174" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19289_07_13.jpg" alt="Figure 7.13: Color gradient"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.13: Color gradient</p>
			<p>As soon as you do this, you’ll see the entire image change to a gradient of red and green. What happened? Look at the preceding UV image – as we move from left to right, the<a id="_idIndexMarker567"/> red value increases from 0 to 1, and the green does the same from bottom <span class="No-Break">to top.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s try another example. This time, to allow you to choose the color, you can use a <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">uniform</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> variable.</span></p>
			<p>Uniforms<a id="_idIndexMarker568"/> allow you to pass data into the shader from outside. Declaring a <strong class="source-inline">uniform</strong> variable will cause it to appear in the Inspector (similar to the way <strong class="source-inline">@export</strong> works in GDScript) and also allows you to set it <span class="No-Break">via code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
shader_type canvas_item;
uniform vec4 fill_color : source_color;
void fragment() {
    COLOR = fill_color;
}</pre>
			<p>You’ll see that <strong class="bold">Fill Color</strong> has appeared under <strong class="bold">Shader Parameters</strong> in the Inspector, and you can change <span class="No-Break">its value.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer175" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19289_07_14.jpg" alt="Figure 7.14: Shader Parameters"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.14: Shader Parameters</p>
			<p>Why did the entire rectangle of the image change color in these examples? Because the output <strong class="source-inline">COLOR</strong> is applied to every pixel. Our player image has transparent pixels surrounding it, so we can ignore those by not changing the pixel’s <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">a</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> value:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
COLOR.rgb = fill_color.rgb;</pre>
			<p>Now we <a id="_idIndexMarker569"/>can <a id="_idIndexMarker570"/>change the color of the object. Let’s turn it into a “hit” effect so that we can make the object flash whenever <span class="No-Break">it’s hit:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
shader_type canvas_item;
uniform vec4 fill_color : source_color;
uniform bool active = false;
void fragment() {
    if (active == true) {
        COLOR.rgb = fill_color.rgb;
    }
}</pre>
			<p>Note that now you can toggle the color on and off by clicking the <strong class="bold">Active</strong> property. Since both <strong class="source-inline">uniform</strong> variables appear in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>, you could now add a track to an <strong class="source-inline">AnimationPlayer</strong> that animates these values for your <span class="No-Break">visual effect.</span></p>
			<p>Here’s another example. This time, we’ll create an outline around <span class="No-Break">the image:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
shader_type canvas_item;
uniform vec4 line_color : source_color;
uniform float line_thickness : hint_range(0, 10) = 0.5;
void fragment() {
    vec2 size = TEXTURE_PIXEL_SIZE * line_thickness;
    float outline = texture(TEXTURE, UV + vec2(-size.x,
        0)).a;
    outline += texture(TEXTURE, UV + vec2(0, size.y)).a;
    outline += texture(TEXTURE, UV + vec2(size.x, 0)).a;
    outline += texture(TEXTURE, UV + vec2(0, -size.y)).a;
    outline = min(outline, 1.0);
    vec4 color = texture(TEXTURE, UV);
    COLOR = mix(color, line_color, outline - color.a);
}</pre>
			<p>In this<a id="_idIndexMarker571"/> shader, we have a lot more going on. We’re using the built-in <strong class="source-inline">TEXTURE_PIXEL_SIZE</strong> to get the normalized size of each pixel (its size <a id="_idIndexMarker572"/>compared to the size of the image). Then, we get a float value that “adds up” how transparent the pixels on all four sides of the image are. Finally, we use the <strong class="source-inline">mix()</strong> function to combine the original pixel’s color with the line color based on that <span class="No-Break">outline value.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer176" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19289_07_15.jpg" alt="Figure 7.15: Outline shader"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.15: Outline shader</p>
			<p>An important thing to note – did you notice that the outline did not go below the character’s feet? This is because an object’s shader can only affect the pixels of that image. Since the character’s feet in this image are on the edge, there are no pixels available below them that can be affected by the shader. It’s important to keep this in mind when working on 2D shader effects. If you’re creating 2D art, leave a border of a few pixels around the image to prevent clipping at <span class="No-Break">the edges.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-223"><a id="_idTextAnchor222"/>3D shaders</h2>
			<p>Let’s<a id="_idIndexMarker573"/> try one <a id="_idIndexMarker574"/>3D shader so you can see how the vertex() shader works. In a new scene, add a <strong class="source-inline">MeshInstance3D</strong> with a <strong class="source-inline">PlaneMesh</strong> shape. So that you can see the vertices better, select <strong class="bold">Display Wireframe</strong> from the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Perspective</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> menu.</span></p>
			<p>Click the <strong class="bold">Mesh</strong> resource to expand it and add a new shader in the <strong class="bold">Material</strong> property, just like you <span class="No-Break">did previously.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer177" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19289_07_16.jpg" alt="Figure 7.16: Adding a shader to the plane"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.16: Adding a shader to the plane</p>
			<p>Since we’re using a plane shape, we have four vertices: the four corners of the shape. The <strong class="source-inline">vertex()</strong> function will apply an effect to each of these vertices. For example, adding to their <strong class="source-inline">y</strong> value <a id="_idIndexMarker575"/>would move them <span class="No-Break">all upward.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s start with <span class="No-Break">this code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
shader_type spatial;
void vertex() {
    VERTEX.y += sin(10.0 * UV.x) * 0.5;
}</pre>
			<p>Note <a id="_idIndexMarker576"/>that we’re using a <strong class="source-inline">spatial</strong> type shader now, since our node is <span class="No-Break">a </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Node3D</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer178" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.17: Shifting the vertices</p>
			<p>It doesn’t look like much changed – the two vertices in the +X direction moved down a little bit. But <strong class="source-inline">UV.x</strong> is only either <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>, so the <strong class="source-inline">sin()</strong> function doesn’t have much to do. To see more variation, we need to add more vertices. In the mesh properties, change both <strong class="bold">Subdivide Width</strong> and <strong class="bold">Subdivide Depth</strong> <span class="No-Break">to </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">32</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.18: Working with more vertices</p>
			<p>Now we <a id="_idIndexMarker577"/>can see much more variation in the effect, as the different vertices along the <em class="italic">x</em> axis are moved up or down in a smooth <span class="No-Break">sine wave.</span></p>
			<p>For one <a id="_idIndexMarker578"/>more fun effect, let’s use the <strong class="source-inline">TIME</strong> built-in to animate the effect. Change the code <span class="No-Break">to this:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
VERTEX.y += sin(TIME + 10.0 * UV.x) * 0.5;</pre>
			<p>Take some time to experiment with this. Don’t be afraid to try things – experimentation is a great way to become more comfortable with how <span class="No-Break">shaders work.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-224"><a id="_idTextAnchor223"/>Learning more</h2>
			<p>Shaders are capable of an amazing range of effects. Experimenting with Godot’s shader language is a great way to learn the basics. The best place to start is with the shader section of<a id="_idIndexMarker579"/> <span class="No-Break">Godot’s documentation:</span></p>
			<p><a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/shaders/"><span class="No-Break">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/shaders/</span></a></p>
			<p>There is also a wealth of resources on the internet for learning more. When learning about shaders, you can use resources that aren’t specific to Godot, and you shouldn’t have much trouble getting them to work in Godot. The concept is the same across all types of <span class="No-Break">graphics applications.</span></p>
			<p>In addition, Godot’s documentation includes a page on converting shaders from other popular sources into Godot’s version <span class="No-Break">of GLSL.</span></p>
			<p>To see <a id="_idIndexMarker580"/>some examples of just how powerful shaders can be, <span class="No-Break">visit </span><a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/"><span class="No-Break">https://www.shadertoy.com/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>This section was only a brief introduction to the in-depth topic of shaders and shader effects. While it can be a very challenging subject to master, the power it gives you makes it well worth <span class="No-Break">the effort.</span></p>
			<p>In the next section, you’ll see how it’s possible to use other programming languages <span class="No-Break">with Godot.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-225"><a id="_idTextAnchor224"/>Using other programming languages in Godot</h1>
			<p>The projects in this book have all been written using GDScript. GDScript has a number of advantages that make it the best choice for building your games. It is very tightly integrated with Godot’s API, and its Python-style syntax makes it useful for rapid development while also being <span class="No-Break">very beginner-friendly.</span></p>
			<p>It’s not the only option, however. Godot also supports two other “official” scripting languages and also provides tools for integrating code using a variety of <span class="No-Break">other languages.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-226"><a id="_idTextAnchor225"/>C#</h2>
			<p>C# is <a id="_idIndexMarker581"/>very popular in game development, and the Godot version is based on the .NET 6.0 framework. Because of its wide use, there are many resources available for learning C# and a great deal of existing code in the language for accomplishing a variety of <span class="No-Break">game-related functions.</span></p>
			<p>At the time<a id="_idIndexMarker582"/> of writing, Godot version 4.0 is still relatively new. Features are being added and bugs are being fixed continuously, so see the C# documentation at this link to get the latest <span class="No-Break">information: </span><a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/index.html"><span class="No-Break">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/index.html</span></a></p>
			<p>If you want to try out the C# implementation, you’ll need to first make sure you have the .NET SDK installed, which you can get from <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download">https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download</a>. You must also download the Godot version that has C# support included, which you can find at <a href="http://godotengine.org/download">http://godotengine.org/download</a>, where it is <a id="_idIndexMarker583"/>labeled <strong class="bold">Godot Engine - .</strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">NET</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>You’ll also need to use an external editor – such as Visual Studio Code or MonoDevelop – that provides more debugging and language functionality than Godot’s built-in editor. You can set this in <strong class="bold">Editor Settings</strong> under the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Dotnet</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> section.</span></p>
			<p>To <a id="_idIndexMarker584"/>attach a C# script to a node, select the language from the <strong class="bold">Attach Node </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Script</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> dialog:</span></p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.19: Create script dialog</p>
			<p>In general, scripting in C# works very much the same as what you’ve already done in GDScript. The main difference is that the API functions are renamed in PascalCase to follow C# standards instead of the snake_case that’s standard <span class="No-Break">for GDScript.</span></p>
			<p>There are also a number of existing C# libraries that you may find useful in building your game. Things such as procedural generation, artificial intelligence, or other intensive topics may be easier to implement using available <span class="No-Break">C# libraries.</span></p>
			<p>Here’s an example of CharacterBody2D movement in C#. Compare this with the movement script in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Jungle Jump</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
using Godot;
public partial class MyCharacterBody2D : CharacterBody2D
{
    private float _speed = 100.0f;
    private float _jumpSpeed = -400.0f;
    // Get the gravity from the project settings so you can
       sync with rigid body nodes.
    public float Gravity = ProjectSettings.GetSetting(
        "physics/2d/default_gravity").AsSingle();
    public override void _PhysicsProcess(double delta)
    {
        Vector2 velocity = Velocity;
        // Add the gravity.
        velocity.Y += Gravity * (float)delta;
        // Handle jump.
        if (Input.IsActionJustPressed("jump") &amp;&amp;
        IsOnFloor())
            velocity.Y = _jumpSpeed;
        // Get the input direction.
        Vector2 direction = Input.GetAxis("ui_left",
            "ui_right");
        velocity.X = direction * _speed;
        Velocity = velocity;
        MoveAndSlide();
    }
}</pre>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-227"><a id="_idTextAnchor226"/>Other languages – GDExtension</h2>
			<p>There are many programming languages to choose from. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, as well as its fans who prefer to use it over other options. While it doesn’t make sense to support every language directly in Godot, there are situations where GDScript is not sufficient to solve a particular problem. Perhaps you want to use an existing external library, or you’re doing something computationally intensive – such as AI or procedural world generation – that it doesn’t make sense to write <span class="No-Break">in GDScript.</span></p>
			<p>Because GDScript is an interpreted language, it trades performance for flexibility. This means that for some processor-intensive code, it can run unacceptably slow. In this case, the highest performance would be achieved by running native code written in a compiled language. In this situation, you can move that code <span class="No-Break">to GDExtension.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">GDExtension</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker586"/>technology that opens up the same API available to GDScript and C#, making it possible to write code in other languages that talks to Godot. By default, it works directly with C and C++, but by using <strong class="bold">third-party bindings</strong>, you <a id="_idIndexMarker587"/>can use it with many <span class="No-Break">other languages.</span></p>
			<p>At the time of writing, several projects are available that use GDExtension to allow you to use other languages for scripting. These include C, C++, Rust, Python, Nim, and others. While these additional language bindings are still relatively new at the time of writing, they each have a dedicated group of developers working on them. If you’re interested in using a particular language with Godot, a Google search of “godot + &lt;language name&gt;” will help you find <span class="No-Break">what’s available.</span></p>
			<p>Working with other programming languages is certainly not required for just about any game project you may encounter, so don’t feel that it’s something you need to learn if it’s foreign to you. It’s presented here for those to whom it might be useful, and it’s something to keep in mind if you have a preferred language you’d like to <span class="No-Break">work with.</span></p>
			<p>In the next section, you can explore the community resources that are available for you to learn more about how Godot works, find examples, and even get help with your <span class="No-Break">own projects.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-228"><a id="_idTextAnchor227"/>Getting help – community resources</h1>
			<p>Godot’s online<a id="_idIndexMarker588"/> community is one of its strengths. Because of its open source nature, there is a wide variety of people working together to improve the engine, write documentation, and help each other <span class="No-Break">with issues.</span></p>

			<p>As illustrated by <a id="_idIndexMarker597"/>this section, one of the great strengths of the Godot Engine is its community. The resources listed here, along with many others, are built by the community of Godot users who are passionate about the engine and about helping others. In the next section, you<a id="_idTextAnchor229"/> can find out how you can contribute to Godot <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-230"><a id="_idTextAnchor230"/>Contributing to Godot</h1>
			<p>Godot is an open source, community-driven project. All of the work that’s done to build, test, document, and otherwise support Godot is done primarily by passionate individuals contributing their time and skills. For the majority of contributors, it is a labor of love, and they take pride in helping to build something of quality that people <span class="No-Break">enjoy using.</span></p>
			<p>In order for Godot to continue growing and improving, there is always a need for more members of the community to step up and contribute. There are many ways you can help out, regardless of your skill level or the amount of time you <span class="No-Break">can commit.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-231"><a id="_idTextAnchor231"/>Contributing to the engine</h2>
			<p>There <a id="_idIndexMarker598"/>are two main ways you can directly contribute to Godot’s development. If you visit <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot">https://github.com/godotengine/godot</a>, you can see Godot’s source code, as well as finding out exactly what’s being worked on. Click the <strong class="bold">Clone</strong> or <strong class="bold">Download</strong> button, and you’ll have the up-to-the-minute source code and can test out the latest features. You’ll need to build the engine, but don’t be intimidated: Godot is one of the easiest open source projects to compile that you’ll find. See <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/development/compiling/index.html">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/development/compiling/index.html</a> <span class="No-Break">for instructions.</span></p>
			<p>If you’re not able to actually contribute to the C++ code, go to the <strong class="bold">Issues</strong> tab, where you can report or read about bugs and suggestions for improvements. There is always a need for people to confirm bug reports, test fixes, and give their opinions on <span class="No-Break">new features.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-232"><a id="_idTextAnchor232"/>Writing documentation</h2>
			<p>Godot’s <a id="_idIndexMarker599"/>official documentation is only as good as its community’s contributions. From something as small as correcting a typo to writing an entire tutorial, all levels of help are very welcome. The home of the official documentation <span class="No-Break">is </span><a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs"><span class="No-Break">https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Hopefully, by now, you’ve taken some time to browse through the official documentation and get an idea of what’s available. If you spot something wrong or something missing, open an issue at the aforementioned GitHub link. If you’re comfortable with using GitHub, you can even go ahead and submit a pull request yourself. Just make sure you read all the guidelines first so that your contribution will be accepted. You can find the guidelines <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/ways_to_contribute.html"><span class="No-Break">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/ways_to_contribute.html</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>If you speak<a id="_idIndexMarker600"/> a language other than English, translations are also very much needed and will be greatly appreciated by Godot’s non-English-speaking users. See <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/documentation/editor_and_docs_localization">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/documentation/editor_and_docs_localization</a> for how to contribute in <span class="No-Break">your language.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-233"><a id="_idTextAnchor233"/>Donations</h2>
			<p>Godot is a<a id="_idIndexMarker601"/> not-for-profit project, and user donations go a long way to help pay for hosting costs and development resources, such as hardware. Financial contributions also allow the project to pay core developers, allowing them to dedicate themselves part- or full-time to working on <span class="No-Break">the engine.</span></p>
			<p>The easiest way to contribute to Godot is via the donation page <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://godotengine.org/donate"><span class="No-Break">https://godotengine.org/donate</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-234"><a id="_idTextAnchor234"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you learned about a few additional topics that will help you continue to level up your Godot skills. Godot has a great many features in addition to those explored in this book. You’ll need to know where to look and where to ask for help as you move on to working on projects of <span class="No-Break">your own.</span></p>
			<p>You also learned about some more advanced topics, such as working with other programming languages and using shaders to enhance your game’s <span class="No-Break">visual effects.</span></p>
			<p>In addition, since Godot is built by its community, you learned how you could participate and become part of the team that is making it one of the fastest-growing projects of <span class="No-Break">its kind.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-235"><a id="_idTextAnchor235"/>Final words</h1>
			<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this book. I hope you found it useful in starting your game development journey with Godot. The goal of this book was not to give you a “copy-and-paste” solution to making games but rather to help you develop an intuition for the process of game development. As you’ll see when you explore other resources, there are often many ways to solve a problem, and there may not be a single “right” answer. It’s up to you as a developer to evaluate and determine what works for you in your situation. I wish you luck in your future game projects, and I hope to play them sometime in <span class="No-Break">the future!</span></p>
