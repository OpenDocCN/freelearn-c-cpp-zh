# Section 3: Concurrency, Networking, and Databases

In this section, we will learn how to implement concurrency in threads to reduce memory usage and speed up the CPU. We will then learn how to establish communication between processes and create a network between the server and the client. Finally, we will learn how to use a database to store and manage our data.
