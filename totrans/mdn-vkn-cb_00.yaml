- en: This book is designed for experienced computer graphics software engineers who
    might be well versed in older graphics APIs such as OpenGL and DirectX 10 but
    are relatively new to modern graphics APIs. Like you, we found ourselves needing
    to learn Vulkan but struggling to implement practical solutions because we didn’t
    understand the basic concepts of Vulkan, which is, in itself, a complicated and
    vast API. The goal of this book is to introduce you to the essential concepts
    of the API and then walk you through hand-picked, tried-and-true algorithms that
    show you the new and nuanced aspects of Vulkan in each recipe.

    but in this book, we offer a two-part story that progressively helps you understand
    the basic Vulkan concepts by providing easy and practical examples. The subsequent
    parts present implementations that work and can be used as a reference for the
    implementation of your own graphics engine.

- en: The main goal of the repository provided with this book was not to achieve the
    highest performance, find clever ways to implement things, or even implement the
    shiniest new algorithm shown at last year’s GDC or SIGGRAPH. It was simplicity
    and completeness. We offer tips and tricks on how some Vulkan features can and/or
    must be used, and most recipes have been tested and debugged and provide you with
    a self-contained working solution that you can improve and use in your own code
    base. Each recipe is its own executable and can be inspected independently from
    the others, making them easy to read. That also makes it easy to understand all
    the details of each algorithm from beginning to end.

    It’s a mature, feature-rich, and maintained API, supported by all GPU vendors,
    operating systems, frameworks, and languages. If you intend to write graphics
    applications or write one that uses only the compute facilities of Vulkan, getting
    to know the API is a must, and you need to learn it right now!

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book has been written for experienced graphics software engineers who would
    like to learn more about Vulkan. Knowing at least one other graphics API, such
    as OpenGL, and one of its variants, such as WebGL, OpenGL ES, or DirectX (up to
    version 9 or 10), is suggested but not strictly necessary. It is important to
    know graphics principles, such as transformations, graphics pipelines, shaders,
    lighting, the basics of ray tracing, and depth and stencil buffers, to name a
    few. More advanced topics, such as PBR and all its concepts, aren’t necessary
    but may be helpful.

- en: Finally, the code has been written entirely in C++, as it is the most widely
    used programming language for writing graphics applications. Even though some
    C++20 features are used in the book because they help reduce Vulkan’s verbosity,
    you are not expected to have intimate knowledge of the newest C++ features.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B18491_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor019), *Vulkan Core Concepts*, provides
    a walk-through of the most basic Vulkan concepts and objects and how to create
    and use them. The chapter covers how Vulkan can be used and initialized and how
    its objects interplay and are managed from the application. At the end of the
    chapter, we present a recipe for how those concepts can be used to create the
    simplest graphics application in Vulkan.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B18491_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor126), *Working with Modern Vulkan*,
    presents more advanced Vulkan concepts and objects, such as barriers, descriptors,
    and pipelines, that allow you to start using resources other than just data provided
    directly in the shader code. This chapter also offers a brief overview of modern
    rendering techniques, such as **Programmable Vertex Pulling** (**PVP**) and **Multidraw**
    **Indirect** (**MDI**).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B18491_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor217), *Implementing GPU-Driven Rendering*,
    has recipes that implement what is called GPU-driven rendering: techniques that
    generate data directly from shaders with little or no input from the CPU. The
    generated data remains in the GPU after being generated and can be used to direct
    how to render a scene; or, the data can be presented directly on screen as debug
    information.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B18491_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor241), *Exploring Techniques for
    Lighting, Shading, and Shadows*, explores known graphics techniques but from a
    Vulkan perspective. Recipes include implementations of deferred rendering, screen-space
    reflections, shadow maps, and screen-space ambient occlusion, demonstrating how
    to achieve practical results while navigating the complexity of Vulkan.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B18491_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor264), *Deciphering Order-Independent
    Transparency*, contains recipes for implementing transparency using Vulkan, all
    the way from simpler algorithms, such as depth-peeling and dual depth-peeling,
    to more advanced and physically correct implementations, such as order-independent
    transparency, that run exclusively on the GPU. While some of those recipes may
    seem old, they really show the power of the Vulkan API.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B18491_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor283), *Anti-Aliasing Techniques*,
    provides a comprehensive list of anti-aliasing techniques that can be used with
    Vulkan. The first recipe uses the multisample anti-aliasing feature provided by
    Vulkan, while the others offer alternate ways to provide antialiasing without
    using the facilities provided by the API.'

    is an introduction to ray tracing with Vulkan and uses the new Vulkan ray tracing
    extensions. Most of the chapter will walk you through how to implement a path
    tracer in your application and use it to render a ray-traced scene and display
    it on screen. The chapter spends the last few pages demonstrating how to use a
    hybrid approach in your existing rasterization engine to make it pop with a few
    ray-traced features.'

    introduces you to the realm of extended reality, which encompasses virtual, mixed,
    and augmented reality. The chapter introduces OpenXR, including its main features
    and how to use it. The chapter then explains how to improve your rendering engine’s
    performance using Vulkan and OpenXR features, such as multiview rendering and
    dynamic foveation.'
