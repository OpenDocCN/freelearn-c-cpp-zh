    which are very useful in remote monitoring and control, whether they involve asset
    tracking or remote operation monitoring. This project uses the **Arduino MKR GSM
    1400** development board, which is equipped with the latest communication bands
    and was specially designed for **Industrial Internet of Things** (**IIoT**) and
    **Internet of Things** (**IoT**) use cases. This project practically explains
    how you can develop a tracking solution based on cellular communications for different
    use cases. This chapter will help you to understand cellular communication technology,
    global IoT SIM cards, and the integration of Arduino IoT Cloud using cellular
    technology. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to develop solutions
    for remote areas using cellular technology.

    GPS 模块提供广泛的性能；它们在屋顶下以及晴朗的天空下都能工作，并且具有多个精度功能。
- en: While monitoring an asset’s location, there are some other parameters that are
    very important to monitor in different industries, such as temperature and humidity,
    which are very important in food and medical products. CO2 and LPG gases are very
    important to monitor during fuel transportation. Try different sensors with a
    GPS module to set up different tracking prototypes for different industries.

  zh: 摘要
- en: In this chapter, we explored how to develop a GPS-based tracking system using
    a global IoT SIM card and GPS module. We set up the Thing, which included cloud
    variable creation, device association, GSM network configuration, and coding a
    development board. Later, we created a dashboard to visualize the Thing readings
    with different types of widgets to display current readings, with the most important
    widget of the chapter being the Map widget. It is a very interesting and important
    widget to display the location of IoT devices using GPS coordinates.

  zh: 在本章中，我们探讨了如何使用全球物联网SIM卡和GPS模块开发一个基于GPS的跟踪系统。我们设置了“物”，包括创建云变量、设备关联、GSM网络配置以及编写开发板代码。随后，我们创建了一个仪表盘，使用不同类型的控件来可视化“物”的读数，其中本章最重要的控件是地图控件。这是一个非常有趣且重要的控件，用于显示物联网设备的GPS坐标位置。
- en: GPS tracking is a very important aspect that we covered in this chapter, and
    it helps us to develop a device for our asset tracking, which will help us in
    asset tracking and monitoring. This chapter demonstrated how we can display the
    location of a device on the dashboard, which gives you the confidence to build
    more solutions regarding asset tracking. In the next chapter, we will explore
    another long-range communication technology, called **LoRaWAN**. We will use this
    technology to build a solution for remote monitoring distant areas as well as
    compare this technology with GSM/4G/LTE and NB-IoT technology for proper guidance.
