			<h2 id="_idParaDest-181"><a id="_idTextAnchor193"/>Introduction</h2>
			<p>This chapter is a bit like the Roman god, Janus. Janus was the gatekeeper of heaven and had two faces. One of Janus' faces looked forward and the other backward; his name survives in the month January – looking forward to the new year and backward to the year that has passed.</p>
			<p>This chapter similarly has two faces: one looks outward, from the perspective of a developer to the business that this person finds themselves interacting with; the other looks inward, from the perspective of the business to the developer. To keep things exciting, the narrative changes between these positions more than once.</p>
			<p>"But I'm self-employed," I hear some of you saying. You still engage in business activities. You might have to justify your work to your client rather than your manager, but the concepts remain the same.</p>
			<p>Even if you're a junior developer with plenty of levels of management above you, it still pays to understand the business you're in and how your work fits into the company's goals. Reasons for this begin with the cynical: you'll probably be expected to take a "bigger picture" or strategic view of your work to progress up the pay scale. But it's also going to be helpful; if you know what the business pressures are, you can understand why management is coming up with the suggestions and rules that they are.</p>
			<p>If you <em class="italics">are</em> a junior programmer, this is likely to be the biggest change that helps your career progression (and, unfortunately, was one I learned the hard way). If all you see is the code, then all you see in management decisions is people getting in the way of writing code. They actually have different pressures, different inputs, and different experiences, so it's unsurprising that those people have come up with different priorities. Understanding that is the first step towards empathizing with their position and becoming a more valuable member of the team.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-182"><a id="_idTextAnchor194"/>Evaluate Risks Dispassionately</h2>
			<p>On any project, there are things that could go wrong. Are you being realistic about them? What are the things that <em class="italics">have</em> gone wrong on projects you've worked on before? Did you consider the risk of those going wrong this time around? Did you think about how you might control the things that led to them going wrong?</p>
			<p>According to some researchers in the field of disaster response, there are <em class="italics">five considerations in risk estimation</em>, leading to five different ways to get risk management wrong:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Incorrect evaluation of probability (usually presented as optimism bias – the false belief that nothing can go wrong)</li>
				<li>Incorrect evaluation of impact (again, usually assuming, optimistically, that the damage won't be too great)</li>
				<li>Statistical neglect (ignoring existing real data in forecasting future outcomes, usually in favor of folklore or other questionable heuristics)</li>
				<li>Solution neglect (not considering all options for risk reduction, thus failing to identify the optimal solution)</li>
				<li>External risk neglect, in which you fail to consider factors outside the direct scope of the project that could nonetheless have an impact</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-183"><a id="_idTextAnchor195"/>Project Risks</h3>
			<p>Reminiscence of my experience making—and then failing to meet—estimates leads me to believe that ignoring risks leads to unmet schedule expectations more often than underestimating the time required to do the work. In other words, "oh I thought this would take 3 days but it took me 5" does happen, but less frequently than "oh I thought this would take 3 days and it did but I was taken off the project for 2 days by this other thing."</p>
			<p>Techniques such as <strong class="bold">the velocity factor</strong>—<a href="https://resources.collab.net/agile-101/agile-scrum-velocity">https://resources.collab.net/agile-101/agile-scrum-velocity</a> and <strong class="bold">evidence-based scheduling</strong>—<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/10/26.html">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/10/26.html</a>) try to account for both of these impacts by comparing estimated completion time with actuals and providing a "fudge factor" by which to multiply subsequent estimates. </p>
			<p>Assuming that both scheduling failures and external interruptions follow a Poisson distribution, that fudge factor should be roughly correct (given infinite prior data as input, which might be tricky to arrange). But then if that assumption's valid, you could just build a Poisson model (such as, as Spolsky suggests in the above link, a Monte Carlo simulation) to guess how the project will go.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-184"><a id="_idTextAnchor196"/>Business Risks</h3>
			<p>At time of writing, the world of the Twitter client author has just been changed by updates to <strong class="bold">Twitter's Developer Rules of the Road</strong>—<a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy.html">https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy.html</a>. The company is limiting the number of client tokens any app can have before discussing their case with Twitter. They're also strongly discouraging (as they have done before) the standard "Twitter client" product category, suggesting that developers avoid developing that sort of product.</p>
			<p>It's clear that, for a Twitter client app, Twitter is a single point of failure. Indeed, at a technical level, the service still occasionally suffers from short outages. But it's also a single point of failure at the <em class="italics">business</em> level—if they don't want to support what you want to do, there's little chance of it happening on their platform. It's not like you can point to how much you've paid them and would continue to pay them; the platform is free to developers and users alike.</p>
			<p>Are there any companies or platforms that could similarly pull the rug out from under your business? What's the likelihood of that happening, and what will you do either to avoid or to react to it? What competitors do you have, and how does their behavior affect your plans? What patents might your work infringe on? And, in these days of cloud computing, how important is the San Andreas Fault or an Atlantic hurricane to your business?</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-185"><a id="_idTextAnchor197"/>Operational Risks</h3>
			<p>Operational risks are defined as risks arising from the potential for an organization's internal processes to fail. Perhaps your data recovery plan isn't resilient to losing your main office: that might be an operational risk. A salesperson failing to store a customer's information in the CRM, leading to a missed follow-up call and therefore a lost sales opportunity, is also an operational risk.</p>
			<p>Of course, some level of operational risk is acceptable. Internal processes do not generate any profit, so gold-plating them means sinking a lot of cost in return for smaller losses rather than greater income. This is, in my experience, the ultimate end for utility and commodity companies, where getting something wrong is a bigger danger than any external factors. Internal processes will ossify as operational risks are removed, pushing costs up as reduced prices squeeze the margins from the other side.</p>
			<p>Bad management decisions can also be classed as operational risks, as they represent internal processes of a sort.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-186"><a id="_idTextAnchor198"/>Other External Risks</h3>
			<p>Are there regulatory risks to your business? Many software companies, particularly those in social networks and mobile apps, are starting to find that <strong class="bold">California's Online Privacy Protection Act</strong>—<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2018966/california-sues-delta-airlines-over-app-privacy-policy.html">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2018966/california-sues-delta-airlines-over-app-privacy-policy.html</a> is relevant to their work, even though they aren't necessarily based in California (Apple and Google, their exclusive distributors, <em class="italics">are</em> based in California).</p>
			<p>Which rules or laws could change that would affect what your company does? Are those changes likely to happen? How would you have to modify what you do to take the new regulations into account, and are you prepared for that?</p>
			<p>Is your pricing correct? If you reduced your price, you would increase unit sales; if you increased your price, you would increase revenue per sale. Which is the best route to take? Is your current price optimal? Michael Jurewitz, then of Black Pixel, wrote <strong class="bold">a series of detailed posts</strong> on this topic, using one particular model of software pricing:</p>

			</ul>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-187"><a id="_idTextAnchor199"/>Career Risks</h3>
			<p>That thing you're doing now. Yes, that thing. Eww, no, not <em class="italics">that</em> thing; the other thing. Will you still be doing it in 10 years?</p>
			<p>Here's a hint: the answer's probably "no." Not <em class="italics">definitely</em> no, but probably no. Here's what I was doing in 2002:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Learning condensed matter physics and particle physics</li>
				<li>Waiting for the success of desktop Linux</li>
				<li>Teaching myself Objective-C programming</li>
				<li>Coding in Perl and Pascal</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Of those, it's only really Objective-C that's at all relevant to what I do now; maybe I pull Perl out once a year or less. (Of course, many people <em class="italics">are</em> still waiting for desktop Linux, so maybe I just quit too easily.) So, of the things you're doing now, which will still be around in 10 years? Which will be recognizably the same as they currently are?</p>
			<p>And what are you doing about that? Of course, education is part of the solution; there's <em class="italics">Chapter 10, Learning</em>, in this book. But this section's about dispassionately evaluating risks, and that's important too: put aside what you <em class="italics">want</em> to be doing in 10 years' time. Sure, you <em class="italics">could</em> focus on writing iOS apps in Objective-C in 2022, just as you <em class="italics">could</em> be focused on writing Mac Carbon software or Palm Treo apps in 2012.</p>
			<p>Will what you're doing now still be important then? Will it have been replaced by something else? If so, will it be from the same vendor? Even if it still exists, will there still be enough money in it for you to support yourself? And if the answers are no: what will you do before it happens?</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-188"><a id="_idTextAnchor200"/>Dealing with Risks</h3>
			<p>It's possible to get paralyzed by indecision: should we proceed before we have understood and controlled <em class="italics">all</em> the risks that could be faced by the company? That mentality won't be very profitable; essentially, profit can be seen as a return on taking risks.</p>
			<p>You can decide what risks are important by evaluating their likely costs. Some people do this in a currency unit (that is, dollars it'll cost to recover from this happening times the probability of it happening in a given time period); others do it in abstract units such as high/medium/low likelihood and impact. Either way, the outcome is a list of risks ranked by importance, and it's easy to choose a low watermark, below which you just accept any risks.</p>
			<p>Acceptance (or "sucking it up") is a very cheap way to deal with a risk. Other ways include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Withdrawal</strong>: Remove any likelihood and impact of a risky event occurring by refusing to participate in the risky activity. Withdrawing from the activity certainly mitigates any risk very reliably, but it also means no possibility of gaining the reward associated with participation.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Transference</strong>: You can opt to transfer the risk to another party, usually for a fee: this basically means taking out insurance. This doesn't affect the probability that our risky event will come to pass but means that someone else is liable for the damages.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Countermeasures</strong>: Finding some technical or process approach to reduce the risk. This means, of course, one or more of limiting its likelihood or the expected damage. But think about deploying these countermeasures: you've now made your business or your application a bit more complex. Have you introduced new risks? Have you increased the potential damage from some risks by reducing others? And, of course, is your countermeasure cost-effective? You don't want to spend $1,000 to save $100.<h4>Personal Experience</h4><p class="callout">Being mainly experienced in writing iOS apps, Apple is of course a single point of failure in my work. If they change the platform in ways I can't adapt to, I'll be out of luck: but I don't think that's very likely. They've shown (and said at their developer conferences) that they plan to iterate on their current platform for the foreseeable future.</p><p class="callout">On the other hand, they can and <em class="italics">do</em> reject applications that are inconsistent with their submission guidelines. My approach here has been twofold: firstly, to use the process countermeasure of planning apps that aren't obviously inconsistent with the guidelines. Secondly, transference: I don't sell any of the software I make myself, but sell development services (whether as an employee, consultant, or contractor) to people who themselves take on the risks associated with getting the products to market.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-189"><a id="_idTextAnchor201"/>Find Out What You Need to Know, And How You Can Know It</h2>
			<p>True story: I thought about opening this segment with the Donald Rumsfeld "there are the known knowns" quote. It didn't take long to find that he wasn't the first person to say that: here's Ibn Yamin, taken from the <em class="italics">Wikipedia entry for the Rumsfeld speech</em>—<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns</a>:</p>
			<p><em class="italics">One who knows and knows that he knows... His horse of wisdom will reach the skies.</em></p>
			<p><em class="italics">One who knows, but doesn't know that he knows... He is fast asleep, so you should wake him up!</em></p>
			<p><em class="italics">One who doesn't know, but knows that he doesn't know... His limping mule will eventually get him home.</em></p>
			<p><em class="italics">One who doesn't know and doesn't know that he doesn't know... He will be eternally lost in his hopeless oblivion!</em></p>
			<p>The thing is that, had I not looked this up, I could've confidently attributed that idea to Rumsfeld. "Aha," thinks I, "I've shown an example of thinking I know what I'm doing when I really don't. This is classic <strong class="bold">Dunning-Kruger Effect</strong>—<a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect">http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect</a>."</p>
			<p>Then, of course, ready to find and cite their Ig Nobel-winning paper, I spied the Darwin quote at the linked rationalwiki page:</p>
			<p><em class="italics">Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge</em></p>
			<p>In each of these cases, armed with an idea of what I wanted to say, it only took one web search to find:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A claim (that I could verify) that the idea was earlier than I imagined; which also served as…</li>
				<li>…a reminder that I don't know everything about what I'm writing.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It's really <em class="italics">that</em> easy to go from "thinking you know what you're talking about" to "realizing you don't know very much." That means it's probably best to assume that you don't know very much; particularly, if you're facing a new challenge you haven't dealt with before.</p>
			<p>The way I like to help along this realization when I'm planning is to spend about 5 minutes with an outline tool such as <strong class="bold">OmniOutliner</strong> or <strong class="bold">iThoughts</strong> HD, just writing down questions that are relevant to the problem at hand. Even that small amount of work gives me a plan for later research, and the humility needed to follow it up.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-190"><a id="_idTextAnchor202"/>What You Discover May Not Be to Your Liking</h2>
			<p>Sometimes, you'll look at the results of the research you've done and realize that things don't look promising.</p>
			<p>Perhaps there aren't as many customers for your product as you first assumed, development is going to be harder, or you've found a competing product you didn't know about before. Perhaps the task you estimated would take 2 days is going to take longer than a week.</p>
			<p>You need to decide what you're going to do about that. The <em class="italics">worst</em> way to do this is by ignoring the problem: you're relying on luck or on faith to get you through. You're cleverer than that; you can think of a plan to overcome the problem.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-191"><a id="_idTextAnchor203"/>Personal Experience</h3>
			<p>One of the first software projects I worked on had a team of three developers, none of whom had much experience with the technology we were using, and two of whom (myself included) didn't really have much experience of anything.</p>
			<p>As we progressed with the project, we found that it was taking us longer than we planned to deliver each build and that the builds were very buggy. We convinced ourselves that we could make up for it in the <em class="italics">next</em> build each time, even though this would mean coming in <em class="italics">under</em> schedule (something we hadn't demonstrated we could do), <em class="italics">and</em> at sufficient quality (ditto), <em class="italics">and</em> finding time to fix all the existing bugs.</p>
			<p>Eventually, our manager had to stop us and point out that for every day of new work we were doing, we were adding <em class="italics">3</em> days of bugfix work. In other words, the project would never be finished if we didn't change what we were doing.</p>
			<p>Contrast that with a project I worked on very recently. Looking at the plan, it was clear that some parts of the software would put significant computational load on the target hardware, and there was a real risk that the full functionality couldn't be delivered because it wouldn't run at an acceptable speed.</p>
			<p>I therefore wrote these parts of the application <em class="italics">first</em>, leaving the standard data-handling parts until later. Sure enough, within 3 weeks, we'd found that there were observable performance problems and we couldn't continue until we'd found a way to address them.</p>
			<p>It worked out that this pushed the schedule out by over a week – in other words, the project was delayed. But because we'd been open about this being a potential problem, had identified it, and addressed it as early as possible, this impact could be handled and didn't cause any great friction.</p>
			<p>Other books have covered this ground; a good place to go for an alternative discussion is the <em class="italics">pivot or persevere</em> section in <em class="italics">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="italics">The Lean Startup by Eric Ries</em>—<a href="http://theleanstartup.com/book">http://theleanstartup.com/book</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-192"><a id="_idTextAnchor204"/>How to Interview A Programmer?</h2>
			<p>I've been on both sides of job interviews for technical positions. I've seen both success and failure (on both sides: my own success rate is currently at around 2/3, where I count a job that I left after 2 months as a failure). This isn't the definitive guide to running an interview, or to being interviewed, but it's a good guide to what interviewers should be looking for. As a result, it's also a good guide to what interviewees can assume interviewers are looking for. How meta!</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-193"><a id="_idTextAnchor205"/>Bear the Goal in Mind</h3>
			<p>The goal of an interview is to find out—often in only an hour or so—whether you could work with the person you're talking to daily without one of the two of you going insane. Some people phrase this as whether you could spend 8 hours trapped in an airport with just the interviewee to talk to. Imagine that, but 5 days a week for the next 2 years.</p>
			<p>Find out enough about their technical skills to decide whether they were lying on their CV. You don't need to probe them on the depth of their skills beyond that; if you didn't think their CV expressed enough relevant experience for them to be good at the role, you wouldn't have invited them in for an interview.</p>
			<p>This focus on the interpersonal side is especially true of interviews for interns, graduates, and other positions where you don't expect applicants to bring much experience to the table. In these cases, you <em class="italics">can't</em> rely on technical questions to carry the interview—almost by definition, the best candidate will probably be unable to provide many answers. Rather than making candidates uncomfortable by showing how much more you know than them, make them comfortable and find out whether they'll be good people to work with.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-194"><a id="_idTextAnchor206"/>The Interview's There for Both of You</h3>
			<p>When I was a fresh graduate, I assumed that the purpose of a job interview was to put on my best suit (My <em class="italics">only</em> suit, at the time) and convince other people to let me work for them. I now know this not to be true, though I still encounter people who behave in this way. I feel that either the real purpose of an interview is being kept secret or careers services don't think people need to be told about it.</p>
			<p><em class="italics">The real purpose of an interview is to find out whether you want to work for that company.</em> Is the interviewer—who will most likely be your colleague or supervisor—someone you'd want to work with? Is the job actually what was advertised? Does it still seem interesting? Do they mention all sorts of extra responsibilities that weren't in the advert? Are the people you're talking to enthusiastic about the company? Where is the business going over the time you envisage being there, and beyond? Do you like that direction? Will you get the freedom and/or supervision that you need?</p>
			<p>If you treat the interview as an advert for your ability to fit in with the hirer's needs, then they'll end up with someone who doesn't actually work as they claimed in the interview, and you'll end up with a job you don't know much about.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-195"><a id="_idTextAnchor207"/>What If You Could Avoid Hypothetical Questions?</h3>
			<p>Whichever side of the interview you're on, avoid questions that investigate what would happen if some conjectural situation came to pass. The answer is always the same.</p>
			<p><em class="italics">Q: What would you do if you had a tight deadline?</em></p>
			<p><em class="italics">A: Whatever the perfect employee would do.</em></p>
			<p><em class="italics">Q: What would you do if a colleague came to you needing help?</em></p>
			<p><em class="italics">A: Whatever the perfect employee would do.</em></p>
			<p>Or, from the other position:</p>
			<p><em class="italics">Q: What would you do if Google moved into this business?</em></p>
			<p><em class="italics">A: Whatever the perfect company would do.</em></p>
			<p><em class="italics">Q: What would you do if your main competitor suddenly introduced a huge killer feature?</em></p>
			<p><em class="italics">A: Whatever the perfect company would do.</em></p>
			<p>You will not find out anything useful by asking these questions. You'll discover how the person opposite you pictures the land of milk and honey; this may be interesting if you're into armchair psychology but is ultimately not going to tell you what would <em class="italics">actually</em> happen in such situations.</p>
			<p>Instead, try to discover what <em class="italics">did</em> happen when those situations occurred.</p>
			<p><em class="italics">Q: What did you do the last time you had a tight deadline?</em></p>
			<p><em class="italics">A: I shouted at my colleagues, told my manager everything was fine, and quit work the day before the build was due.</em></p>
			<p><em class="italics">Q: How did the company react when Google brought out a similar product?</em></p>
			<p><em class="italics">A: The executive team cashed in their stock options. Then they closed R&amp;D to focus on our core business.</em></p>
			<p>Admittedly, these answers are not as pleasant as the first ones. But they're more specific, more indicative of real behavior, and therefore of what would likely happen should these situations ever arise again. Ultimately, these are better things to discover.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-196"><a id="_idTextAnchor208"/>Don't Try to Prove the Other Person Is Stupid</h3>
			<p>If you've ever been in the Q&amp;A period at the end of a conference talk, you know that it attracts a certain type of person. There'll always be a question that goes—though this wording is changed to make it sound like a question—"I know more about this than you." This is poisonous to the atmosphere of the gathering: the asker looks rude, the answerer is wrong-footed, and the audience learns nothing from the interaction – apart from maybe to avoid working with the person who asked the question.</p>
			<p>Now consider what happens if you're in an interview and manage to teach the other people in the room not to work with you. You'll potentially miss out on either a good job or a good candidate, depending on which side of the desk you're sitting.</p>
			<p>It's fine—nay, <strong class="bold">required</strong>—that different people on a team think and know different things. If you have two people on a team who both bring exactly the same knowledge and opinions, one of them is redundant. This was told to me by a former manager of mine. Needless to say, I disagreed in order to remain employable.</p>
			<p>You may know something the other person in the interview doesn't, but you shouldn't crow about it. Instead, you should discover what the other person does when faced with a lack of information. There will be more on this topic in the section on <em class="italics">working with business partners</em>.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-197"><a id="_idTextAnchor209"/>Personal Experience</h3>
			<p><em class="italics">My first job out of university included, among other things, managing a heterogeneous Unix network. When I started in that job, I asked my manager, John, for feedback about the interview (you should always do this, whether or not you were offered the job).</em></p>
			<p><em class="italics">The interview was a setup that's turned out to be quite common in my experience: I sit on one side of a desk with a few people (the hiring manager, an HR person, and a technical expert) across the way. A "novel" feature was a UNIX workstation sat between us, which had two monitors and two keyboards.</em></p>
			<p><em class="italics">Apparently, the one feature of my interview that stuck in the panel's mind was when I was asked a question that I didn't know the answer to. None of the other candidates knew either; I don't remember the exact question, but it had something to do with getting a list ordered by time of all of the hard links to a particular file on a filesystem.</em></p>
			<p><em class="italics">When I said I didn't know how to do it, the technical guy could've easily rushed to demonstrate how much better at UNIX he was than me, but he didn't. He, like the other interviewers, did nothing. While I mumbled something I was thinking about and sweated into my shirt collar, I pulled the stunt that made my interview memorable and helped me to get the job.</em></p>
			<p><em class="italics">I typed </em><strong class="inline">man ls</strong><em class="italics"> into the Terminal. The interviewers could see that I typed </em><strong class="inline">man ls</strong><em class="italics"> into the terminal, because they had a monitor on the workstation too. They could see that I didn't know what I was doing. They could also see that I wanted to know what I was doing, and I knew how to attack this problem.</em></p>
			<p><em class="italics">The interview moved on before I solved the problem, but the interviewers discovered what they wanted because they didn't stop to point out how clever they were.</em></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-198"><a id="_idTextAnchor210"/>Be Transparent and Honest with Your Business Partners</h2>
			<p>I don't just mean "business partners" as people with whom you entered into business, or even other companies with whom you have a partnership arrangement. I mean everybody you work with in order to get the project completed: you should treat all of these people as peers, whose help you need, and who need your help in order to deliver a quality product to your customers. If you want their respect, honesty, and help you need to be respectful, honest, and helpful to them.</p>
			<p>Currently, this sounds like the sort of hackneyed non-lesson in working with others that has remained unchanged for the last few thousand years: "do as you would be done by." But bear with me; there's more science to it than that.</p>
			<p>Have you ever described someone, or heard someone described, as "clueless"? They "just don't get it"? You've probably experienced the <strong class="bold">correspondence effect</strong>—<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error</a>, a well-studied effect in social psychology. If <em class="italics">you</em> make a suboptimal decision, it's because of the deadline pressure, compromises to incorporate other people's requirements, and other local problems. If <em class="italics">someone else</em> makes a suboptimal decision, it's because they're an idiot. Interestingly, they believe that <em class="italics">their</em> mistakes are due to the situation they find themselves in, and that <em class="italics">your</em> mistakes come about because <em class="italics">you</em> are the idiot.</p>
			<p>Perhaps neither of you is the idiot. Perhaps both of you are trying to do your best at reconciling conflicting needs and pressures. Perhaps your opinions on what to do next differ because you have different information about the problem, not because one of you is a genius and the other a moron.</p>
			<p>That's why transparency is key. If you proclaim "we should do this" or even "we <em class="italics">will</em> do this" with no supporting information, you leave the other people in the conversation free to conclude <em class="italics">why</em> you think that – free to get it wrong. Alternatively, you could say "here's the problem as I see it, this is what we want to get out of solving it, and here is the solution." Now your colleagues and partners are left in no doubt as to why you believe in the approach you present, and you've set a precedent for how they should present their views if they still disagree. The conversation can focus on the problems facing the project, not the imbeciles around the table.</p>
			<h4>An Aside On Persuasion</h4>
			<p class="callout">Framing an argument in this way is a well-known rhetorical technique. First, people identify themselves as facing the problem you describe, so that when you describe the benefits of a solution, your audience agrees that it would help. When you finally present your proposed solution, people already know that they want it. <em class="italics">Nancy Duarte's talk at TEDxEast</em>—<a href="https://www.duarte.com/presentation-skills-resources/nancys-talk-from-tedxeast-you-can-change-the-world/">https://www.duarte.com/presentation-skills-resources/nancys-talk-from-tedxeast-you-can-change-the-world/</a> goes into more depth on this theme.</p>
			<p>Of course, people may still disagree with your conclusions and the reasons you reached them. Listen to their arguments. Ask why (if they didn't already tell you). Remember that this is software development, not a high school debating club: you "win" by creating a great product that satisfies a business problem, not by ensuring that your argument is accepted over all others.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-199"><a id="_idTextAnchor211"/>Choose Appropriate Technology</h2>
			<p>As the last sentence of the previous section says, the goal here is to satisfy a business need. If that business need isn't aligned with your current favorite platform or shiny toy, you have to decide which you want to pursue. The best choice for the business – and, therefore, for your role in it as a developer – is the one that achieves the goal with least effort and fewest difficulties or compromises.</p>
			<p>Of course, "effort" can include training – a short (and usually fixed length) effort needed to get developers and others up to speed with some new technology. But then "effort" also includes maintenance and support – ongoing costs that build up over the lifetime of the product in the field. This is sometimes ignored when estimating a project's cost, as the project ends on the ship date, so maintenance is somebody else's problem. That's a false economy though; the maintenance cost of a project is very much the problem of the project team.</p>
			<h4>Aside: Opportunity Cost</h4>
			<p class="callout">No cost analysis is complete without a measure of "opportunity cost." The opportunity cost of an activity can be thought of as the answer to the question "what will we miss out on doing if we're doing this thing instead?"</p>
			<p class="callout">So, the actual cost of an activity includes the direct costs (equipment, staff, and so on required) and the opportunity costs; there may also be other negative aspects that are considered "costs."</p>
			<p class="callout">On the flip side, the benefit includes more than simply the money made from a sale. It can include "defended income"—existing customers who do not switch to a competitor as a result of doing the work you're planning. Other benefits can include improved reputation or market position.</p>
			<p class="callout">This has all been a bit Economics 101, but for people who work with exact numbers all day, it's important to remember that a full cost/benefit analysis does not simply involve subtracting money out from money in.</p>
			<p>Factoring opportunity costs into maintenance work causes multiple hits. There's the direct cost of fixing the problems; there's the opportunity cost to your development team, as you must take on less new project work while you're fixing the maintenance problems; and then there's the opportunity cost to the customers, who lose time working around the problems and deploying the maintenance fixes. I'll stop short of quoting <em class="italics">how much</em> more expensive maintenance fixes are; <em class="italics">I've made that mistake before</em>—<a href="http://blog.duarte.com/2011/03/nancy%E2%80%99s-talk-from-tedxeast-you-can-change-the-world/">http://blog.securemacprogramming.com/2012/09/an-apology-to-readers-of-test-driven-ios-development/</a>.</p>
			<p>Another way to look at this technology choice consideration is a quote I heard from <strong class="bold">Jonathan "Wolf" Rentzsch</strong>, though he certainly isn't the original source:</p>
			<p><em class="italics">All code you write is a liability, not an asset.</em></p>
			<p>There's a good discussion of the quote at <em class="italics">Eric Lee's blog on MSDN</em>—<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/elee/archive/2009/03/11/source-code-is-a-liability-not-an-asset.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/elee/archive/2009/03/11/source-code-is-a-liability-not-an-asset.aspx</a>. If your favorite platform would mean writing more code to solve the problem than using some other, then selecting that platform would mean taking on a greater liability. We have a phrase to describe the problem of doing work to solve a problem that's already been solved, one that we use mainly when <em class="italics">other</em> people are guilty of this: <em class="italics">Not Invented Here</em>.</p>
			<p>All of this means that, to some extent, you have to put your personal preferences aside when designing a software system and choosing the technology that will go into it. But that isn't a bad thing; it's a chance to learn even more.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-200"><a id="_idTextAnchor212"/>Manipulation and Inspiration</h2>
			<p>In the previous section, I touched on rhetoric and persuasion. As in any collaborative activity, these are great tools when used judiciously and dangerous weapons at all other times.</p>
			<p>My opinions on business issues are all based on a philosophy of playing a long game. That's why I argue for choosing the right technology even if that means retraining or going slower in the short term for other reasons. If the end result is a better product, you'll have a more satisfied team, happier customers, and more repeat business and referrals.</p>
			<p>In relation to persuasion, the long game is epitomized by inspiring people to follow your path, not manipulating them to do what you want. What's the difference? To me, inspiration is about showing people that what you propose is the best option. Manipulation is pejorative, convincing people to follow some course despite the shortcomings to them or to others.</p>
			<p>Manipulation often means running the risk of getting "caught out," as your mark discovers the true reason behind your ruse or the pitfalls it entails. You then end up having to hide or play down these issues, until your manipulative example becomes degenerate with or even more expensive than doing the right thing.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-201"><a id="_idTextAnchor213"/>Worked Example: An App Store Sale</h3>
			<p><em class="italics">Let's look at this distinction between manipulation and inspiration by examining the case of selling an app in one of the mobile app stores.</em></p>
			<p><em class="italics">The usual approach to selling apps is to charge a one-off cost on initial purchase, as is the case with boxed software. This could suggest a manipulative approach to sales; we want to get someone as far as buying the app, but don't care what they do after that. Indeed, updates to the software are usually distributed for free, so perhaps we'd prefer it if they never used the software after purchase.</em></p>
			<p><em class="italics">The manipulative take, then, would be to put minimal effort into building the product, and more work into describing its features and benefits on the product page. People will see our effusive description of the app and will be all too happy to pay for the download. By the time they've realized that the product page is a lie and the app isn't as good as we claimed, we won't care because we've got their money.</em></p>
			<p><em class="italics">One big problem with the above approach is that it only works for a short while. In the longer term, customers will talk to each other. They'll read the reviews of the app in the store and on other websites, and they'll discover that the app isn't all that we claim. We're going to have to convince the reviewers to write good things about the app.</em></p>
			<p><em class="italics">We could try paying them off ("astroturfing" – the practice of creating fake grass-roots support) but that doesn't scale well; besides, it still leaves the possibility that unwanted "honest" reviews outside our control will be published.</em></p>
			<p><em class="italics">Another way to get good reviews is to create a good product. If people genuinely enjoy using the thing, then they'll gladly tell other people how good it is. Now our victims^Wpotential customers will see the reviews left by other happy customers and will want a piece of the action. Success! We've tricked people into buying our app, and all we had to do was... make a great app.</em></p>
			<p>It's not just in interactions with customers that this tension between short- and long-term benefits can arise – in fact, it will happen anywhere and everywhere in life. It's good to keep your trade-off thermostat somewhere towards the long-term end of the scale, because (hopefully!) your career will long outlast your current project.</p>
			<p>It's with this in mind that I come back to the subject of this section: favoring inspiration over manipulation. You don't want your reputation as you go into your next challenge to be based on the sour taste people experience as they remember working with you on this one.</p>
			<p>But you <em class="italics">do</em> need people to see the project and its challenges from your perspective, and you <em class="italics">do</em> need the help of other people to get everything done. This is where the inspiration comes in. Inspiration should really be about stimulating other people, not about cajoling them. If what you want to do is beneficial for everyone involved, it shouldn't take any special tricks to make other people want to do it too. The details on how to do that are best left to <em class="italics">Chapter 13, Teamwork</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-202"><a id="_idTextAnchor214"/>You Don't Need to Be A Founder to Be A Programmer</h2>
			<p><em class="italics">Thanks to </em><strong class="bold">Rob Rhyne</strong><em class="italics">—</em><a href="http://twitter.com/capttaco">http://twitter.com/capttaco</a><em class="italics"> and </em><strong class="bold">Saul Mora</strong><em class="italics">—</em><a href="http://twitter.com/casademora">http://twitter.com/casademora</a><em class="italics"> for inspiring this section in their NSBrief interview.</em></p>
			<p>As software developers, we live in a great time to start your own business. One person, working with a few freelancers and using some online services, can get an app out in a few months with very little outlay. Success stories abound of programmers who've quit working for "the man" to "go indie" – in other words, to start their own software company.</p>
			<h4>An aside on confirmation bias</h4>
			<p class="callout">One reason that there are so many success stories from small business founders is that the failures don't get invited to give talks. In fact, some people claim that <em class="italics">9 out of 10 new businesses fail within a year</em>—<a href="http://www.gardnerbusiness.com/failures.htm">http://www.gardnerbusiness.com/failures.htm</a>, a number corroborated by my accountant. Because that's not news, and not interesting, it doesn't get reported; so, we only hear about the successes. There's more on biases and fallacies in <em class="italics">Chapter 11, Critical Analysis</em>.</p>
			<p>But it's not for everyone. Some people (myself included) prefer to let other people find the customers and do the marketing, and to get on with writing the software. It's not just the greater focus of salaried development that can be appealing. A well-run company can offer a more structured environment, with clearly defined goals and rewards. Some people thrive on the chaos of running a business, while others want observable progress in becoming a better programmer.</p>
			<p>There are plenty of jobs around, in many countries, for people who want to write software for a company. Even through recent recessions, people were still hiring programmers. The opportunities—and rewards—are there for those who don't want to start their own business.<a id="_idTextAnchor215"/></p>
			<h4>My story</h4>
			<p class="callout">I've been doing this development thing for a while, now. I've worked for large and small companies, been self-employed as a contractor, and run my own consultancy business. Both of these independent ventures were "successful," in that I made enough money to support my lifestyle and got both new and repeat business. Once I'd tasted the indie life, why did I go back?</p>
			<p class="callout">It's at least partially for the reason of structure explained above. I like knowing what's expected of me and working to improve myself against that standard. I found that running my own business, the goals (at least in the first year, which is as far as I got on each occasion) are too short-term: either find a customer or complete their project. I just didn't know what I was doing well enough to set and work towards long-term goals.</p>
			<p class="callout">Another reason is that I'm too gregarious. I really enjoy working with other people – both of the indie jobs I tried involved a lot of working at home or telecommuting, which didn't provide the human contact I needed. It's possible when you're self-employed to hire other people or rent office space in a shared environment to solve this problem. I couldn't afford to do that in my city.</p>
			<p>So, if you want to start your own business, that's cool – you should give it a go. Good luck! But if you don't, or if you try it and it isn't for you, there's no problem with that. Many people (again, I include myself here) are happy being career programmers.</p>
