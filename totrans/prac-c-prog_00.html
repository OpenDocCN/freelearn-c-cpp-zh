<p class="mce-root">This book is on the C programming language and explores all the important elements of C, such as strings, arrays (including one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays), functions, pointers, file handling, threads, inter-process communication, database handling, advanced data structures, graphs, and graphics. As this book takes the cookbook approach, the reader will find independent solutions to different problems that they usually come across while making applications. By the end of the book, the reader will have sufficient knowledge to use high- as well as low-level features of the C language and will be able to apply this knowledge to making real-time applications.</p>

<p>This book is meant for intermediate to advanced programmers and developers who want to make complex and real-time applications in C programming. This book will be of great use for trainers, teachers, and software developers who get stuck while making applications with arrays, pointers, functions, structures, files, databases, inter-process communication, advanced data structures, graphs, and graphics, and wish to see a walkthrough example to find the way out of a given problem.</p>

<p><a href="8fb53153-2430-4beb-9479-0e79a118ce2b.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Working with Arrays</em>, covers some complex but essential operations with arrays. You will learn how to insert an element into an array, multiply two matrices, find the common elements in two arrays, and also how to find the difference between two sets or arrays. Also, you will learn how to find the unique elements in an array and will encounter a technique to help you find out whether a given matrix is a sparse matrix or not. Lastly, we'll look at the procedure to merge two sorted arrays into one array.</p>
<p><a href="6cbb6fdb-cd55-4e74-bd5a-2a2f91575490.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Managing Strings</em>, teaches you how to manipulate strings to the extent of characters. You will learn how to find out whether a given string is a palindrome or not, how to find a given occurrence of the first repetitive character in a string, and how to count each character in a string. You will also learn how to count vowels and consonants in a string and the procedure for converting the vowels in a sentence into uppercase.</p>

In this chapter, you will learn to learn to read a text file and convert all the characters after a period into uppercase. Also, you will learn how to display the content of a random file in reverse order and how to count the number of vowels in a text file. The chapter will also show you how to replace a word in a given text file with another word, and how to keep your file secure from unauthorized access. You will also learn how a file is encrypted.</p>
<p><a href="24489a6a-64ab-44f3-8bd0-952179ea38bb.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Implementing Concurrency</em>, covers how <span>concurrency is implemented</span> in order to increase the efficiency of CPU operations. In this chapter, you will learn to do a task using a single thread. You will also learn to do multiple tasks with multiple threads and examine the technique of sharing data between two threads using mutex. Besides this, you will become familiar with situations where deadlock can be created and how such deadlock situations can be avoided.</p>
<p><a href="b024dbf2-6a6b-4729-bf48-0557c891ecd1.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Networking and Inter-Process Communication</em>, focuses on how to establish communication among processes.

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, path names, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "In the figure, <kbd>1000</kbd> represents the memory address of the <kbd>i</kbd> variable."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre> for(i=0;i&lt;2;i++)<br/>  {<br/>    for(j=0;j&lt;4;j++)<br/>    {<br/>      matR[i][j]=0;<br/>      for(k=0;k&lt;3;k++)<br/>      {<br/>        matR[i][j]=matR[i][j]+matA[i][k]*matB[k][j];<br/>      }<br/>    }<br/>  }</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>printf("How many elements are there? ");<br/><strong>scanf("%d", &amp;n);</strong></pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>D:\CBook&gt;reversestring</strong><br/><strong>Enter a string: manish</strong><br/><strong>Reverse string is hsinam</strong></pre>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Simply click the <span class="packt_screen">Next</span> button to continue.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
