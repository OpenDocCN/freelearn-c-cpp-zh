- en: C++ is a powerful language. Coupled with Qt, you have in your hands a cross-platform
    framework that allies performance and ease of use. Qt is a vast framework that
    provides tools in many areas (GUI, threads, networking, and so on). 25 years after
    its inception, Qt continues to evolve and grow with each release.

- en: This book aims to teach you how to squeeze the best out of Qt with the new C++14
    additions (lambdas, smart pointers, enum classes, and so on). These two technologies
    together bring you a safe and powerful development toolbox. Throughout the book,
    we try to emphasize a clean architecture that lets you create and maintain your
    application in a complex environment.
