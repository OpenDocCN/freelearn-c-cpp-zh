- en: Embedded systems have become increasingly popular in the last two decades thanks
    to the technological progress made by microelectronics manufacturers and designers,
    which has aimed to increase computing power and decrease the size of the logic
    of microprocessors and peripherals.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Designing, implementing, and integrating the software components for these systems
    requires a direct approach to the hardware functionalities in most cases, where
    tasks are implemented in a single thread and there is no operating system to provide
    abstractions to access CPU features and external peripherals. For this reason,
    embedded development is considered a domain on its own in the universe of software
    development, in which the developer’s approach and workflow need to be adapted
    accordingly.

- en: This book briefly explains the hardware architecture of a typical embedded system,
    introduces the tools and methodologies needed to get started with the development
    of a target architecture, and then guides the readers through interaction with
    the system features and peripheral interaction. Some areas, such as energy efficiency
    and connectivity, are addressed in more detail to give a closer view of the techniques
    used to design low-power and connected systems. Later in the book, a more complex
    design, incorporating a (simplified) real-time operating system, is built from
    the bottom up, starting from the implementation of single system components. Finally,
    in this second edition, we have added a detailed analysis of the implementation
    of TrustZone-M, the TEE technology introduced by ARM as part of its latest family
    of embedded microcontrollers.

    specific technologies aimed at improving the robustness of the system against
    programming errors in the application code, or even malicious attempts to compromise
    its integrity.

- en: If you’re a software developer or designer that wants to learn about embedded
    programming, this is the book for you. You’ll also find this book useful if you’re
    a less experienced or a beginner embedded programmer willing to expand your knowledge
    of embedded systems. More experience embedded software engineers may find this
    book useful for refreshing their knowledge of the internals of device drivers,
    memory safety, secure data transfers, privilege separation, and secure execution
    domains.
