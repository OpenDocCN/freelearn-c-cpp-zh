		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>This book will introduce you to microcontroller technology. It focuses particularly on two very capable microcontroller boards, the Blue Pill and the Curiosity Nano, and how to connect sensors to them to solve problems and to support everyday life situations. In addition, this book covers the use of <strong class="bold">light-emitting diodes</strong> (<strong class="bold">LEDs</strong>) and <strong class="bold">liquid-crystal displays</strong> (<strong class="bold">LCDs</strong>) for showing sensor information to its microcontroller board users.</p>
			<p>Microcontroller boards are practical small computers used for getting information from an environment using sensors. In this book, each chapter will focus on a specific problem to be solved with microcontroller technology, incorporating the use of practical sensors.</p>
			<p>Many people from the intended audience would like to start with a microcontroller-based project but they may not know how to begin with it, including what kind of basic hardware and software tools and electronic components they will need to use. This book will cover that.</p>
			<p>A chapter in this book introduces you to the field of electronics, examining and reviewing common electronic components that you will use in this book. Another chapter provides an introduction to C and C++, which will be used for coding Blue Pill and Curiosity Nano applications in most of the chapters.</p>
			<p>One of the most important aspects of this book is that sensor programming via microcontroller boards is becoming more effective and easier than before because several easy coding libraries support them, which saves time and effort when getting either analog or digital data from them. This book explains common sensor-programming libraries.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is intended for students, hobbyists, geeks, and engineers alike who wish to dive into the world of microcontroller board programming. In addition, this book is suitable for digital electronics and microcontroller board beginners. If you are already a skilled electronics hobbyist and/or programmer, you may find this book helpful if you want to use and code efficient sensors with microcontroller boards.</p>
			<p>People that use other types of microcontroller boards (such as Arduino boards) may find this book useful because it includes an introduction to the Blue Pill and Curiosity Nano microcontroller boards, facilitating the skills transfer required to understand and apply them in electronics projects requiring Arduino microcontroller boards.</p>
			<p>Basic knowledge of digital circuits, and C and C++ programming language is desirable but not necessary. This is an introductory book on microcontroller boards for people who are starting with digital electronics projects.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>

			<p>In order to use this book to the full, the reader will need basic knowledge of computer programming and the major operating systems (such as Windows or macOS), although there is a chapter that contains an introduction to C. In order to compile and run the programming examples described in this book, the reader should have the latest Arduino IDE previously installed on their computer (the Blue Pill board can be programmed using the Arduino IDE) and the MPLAB X IDE used for programming the Curiosity Nano microcontroller board; one of the chapters explains how to install and use them. All the program examples contained in this book for the Blue Pill microcontroller board should run on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. The programs that run for the Curiosity Nano microcontroller board were tested on computers running both Windows and Linux operating systems.</p>
