- en: In this part, you will dive into the depths of character animations. You will
    start by computing lookup tables for animation frames and storing the results
    in GPU memory, enabling you to access any animation frame without uploading it
    to the GPU first. You will also learn how to blend between the animation clips
    to create better transitions. Then, you will be introduced to collision detection
    between instances and add collision detection and reaction to a collision based
    on axis-aligned bounding boxes and spheres. You will also explore the idea of
    a graphical, node-based extension to the model editor, allowing you to control
    the behavior of the instances by adding and connecting predefined execution blocks.
    Finally, you will learn how facial animation and additive blending work, and implement
    the two new animation types into the animation editor.
