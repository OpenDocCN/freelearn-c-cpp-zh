    <h1 id="_idParaDest-193" class="partTitle">Tuning Character Animations</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this part, you will dive into the depths of character animations. You will start by computing lookup tables for animation frames and storing the results in GPU memory, enabling you to access any animation frame without uploading it to the GPU first. You will also learn how to blend between the animation clips to create better transitions. Then, you will be introduced to collision detection between instances and add collision detection and reaction to a collision based on axis-aligned bounding boxes and spheres. You will also explore the idea of a graphical, node-based extension to the model editor, allowing you to control the behavior of the instances by adding and connecting predefined execution blocks. Finally, you will learn how facial animation and additive blending work, and implement the two new animation types into the animation editor.</p>
