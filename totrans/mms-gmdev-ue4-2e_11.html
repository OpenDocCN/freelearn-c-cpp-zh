<p>UE4 offers a massive amount of the most cutting edge graphics features developers could hope for. The good news is, for many games on many platforms, with a good set of level designers, this will be handled largely automatically. However, being ignorant of how the systems work in general can have two major drawbacks for a team: not taking advantage of the built-in advanced engine techniques, or you may encounter build time or build size problems and not know where to begin addressing them. While the actual techniques and physics of the lighting available in Unreal could fill books by itself (and does!), our theme of being informed on options and use will be our focus again in this chapter. By the end, confidence in how to best use lighting and how to troubleshoot any problems that arise from it will be assured, to help make a modern beautiful game and guide a team to best practices. This chapter covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Volumetric lightmaps</li>
<li>Atmosphereic and folumetric fog</li>
<li>Lightmass (settings and previewing tools)</li>
<li>Profiling lightmaps</li>
</ul>

<p>As is typical, this chapter will use examples from the <kbd>Chapter 11</kbd> branch of our project on GitHub, but the concepts and techniques are valid in any project:</p>

<p>Engine version used: 4.19.2.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Volumetric lightmaps, lightmass, and fog</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this section, we will briefly go through the three topics listed in the heading, which are often confusing to new or casual game makers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Volumetric lightmaps are a precomputed volume-based set of colors that can be quickly used to determine the bounced lighting in any given area of your map. For those who are familiar with pre-4.18 UE4, this was done via the Indirect Lighting Cache, but that was a fixed sample size. The new lightmaps use more dynamic sampling for added detail. These are different from a plain lightmap, which is color that is directly baked into a scene and applied to objects typically as a blended texture. Another way to think of volumetric lightmaps is as a quick look-up table of complex color information in samples of space.</li>
<li>Lightmass is the system name in Unreal that determines your lighting properties, including how (and whether) volumetric lightmaps are computed. To prevent lighting times from being extreme, typically you will add one or more Lightmass Importance Volumes (an actual basic Unreal volume type), to tell the engine and editor where you care about these computations. With as many ways and times light and volume are combined, it's no wonder it can be hard to follow.</li>
<li>Atmospheric Fog is a visual effect simulating sunlight (or other light) traveling through the atmosphere of a planet. This is set via an Atmospheric Fog object in the map, as well as the settings on lights set to affect it. And related, but unique, is Volumetric Fog is a visual effect where fog appears to fill a volume in a specified region and is appropriately affected by lighting. While it is another use of the word <em>volume</em> in this section, it's defined in Unreal globally via an Exponential Height Fog object in the map, or in a local region via particles. And, like Atmospheric Fog, it is also defined largely by the lights set to affect it.</li>
</ol>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Adding volumetric lightmaps with lightmass volumes</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As noted in the previous section, when adding a Lightmass Importance Volume, the area inside that volume will by default generate volumetric lightmaps. Our FrozenCove map gives an excellent overview of these things. Let's first examine the volume and its placement in the level:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/e79727b7-feee-4e24-8b50-7c3de9da49a8.png"/></p>
<p>Panning back out of the actual cove/cave playable area, you can see this volume encompasses that playable area entirely, but not much else. This is exactly the practice you should try to employ to keep lighting build times down, to reduce the overall number (and thus memory) of saved out lightmaps, and yet give the player the best visual experience in the areas they will most directly view and interact with. Panning around from that height, you can see there is actually quite a bit of modeled-out geometry in these surrounding rocky crags. Their lighting contribution to the player's scene, though, is not relevant, and other than maybe a lucky long shot with our gun that we added in our game, no dynamic objects are ever intended to be seen closely in these areas.</p>
<p>Why are these things important? Let's take just a quick overview of what pre-built lighting gets us in this example, and what good these lightmaps do us. First and foremost is Diffuse Interreflection. This is the technical term for the main use of Lightmass: taking a very detailed model of how light bounces off of objects and precomputing it into a form usable at runtime. Lightmass does this in two distinct ways: firstly by building lightmaps cooked or baked for all the static objects in your scene that are then rendered directly with the geometry at runtime; and secondly as volumetric lightmaps, the quick look-up table of samples of this bounced color for dynamic moving objects at runtime. Without going too deeply into the computations involved, let's focus on the reasoning this is important: some time spent precomputing this information when doing builds of your game generates a <em>much</em> more realistic and visually pleasing scene for your audience at a minimal performance cost at runtime. This interreflection concept, where color bleeds from one object to another near it, may seem a bit extraneous, but take a little time and look up some examples where it is applied and not applied to the same scene, and your brain will immediately choose the scene where it is used as the more realistic and higher-quality rendering. Similarly, Lightmass will compute all manner of shadows, Ambient Occlusion (a technique for shadowing light in nooks and crannies), and much, much more. In the second section of this chapter we'll dig into a lot more of the specifics of Lightmass' settings and how to best take advantage of them. This section was about the most basic way to get Lightmass added to your game (by adding the importance volume) and why adding that importance volume is, well, important!</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Using Atmospheric Fog</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Epic has done a lot of work over the years (specifically updated in 4.16) on making more complex fog techniques more accessible to developers, and at this stage they are relatively easy to add, at least compared to days past. In our cove map example, first we'll examine its use of the Atmospheric Fog object placed within it, as well as its sky and the sky's corresponding directional light properties. For games desiring a sort of low-lying fog effect, where at low altitudes in the game the fog becomes more thick and pronounced, please do see the next sub-section on <em>Exponential Height Fog (Volumetric Fog)</em>. For readers who would like to use localized Volumetric Fog to enhance (or even obscure) an area, have special properties for a localized region, and/or moving/changing dynamic volume fog, the next sub-section will briefly go over this topic as well, and both sections have links in the <em>Further reading</em> section.</p>
<p>But, now on to our example here. While it may not have been immediately noticed when jumping in this level, if you remove the effect or exaggerate it (we'll do the later in two shots here) you can easily see what a difference it makes when looking near the sun out of our cave:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/de5e24e9-4e14-4297-81b8-1c64986af428.png" style="width:37.08em;height:22.92em;"/></p>
<p>Hopefully the haze around the rocks at the top is clear enough, and if you look at the rest of the scene, the area where you can see the sky is noticeably brightened when the sun comes into view, as it is here. Let's look at the settings that generate this. First is the sky sphere, here:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/9cfd8e8b-44d2-441f-9c54-e6e740990203.png"/></p>
<p>Note specifically that it has a Directional Light Actor specified. If we follow that to the one we see there on screen, here are its properties:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/5fc347ad-72de-4761-a656-56963000d6a3.png"/></p>
<p>And of course, central to these properties is the Atmosphere / Fog Sun Light box, which lets our Atmospheric Fog properties know this is the source of the sun when creating its volume fog:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/ad564405-c3ad-4c6d-9b64-140fe98821e8.png"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>And lastly, let's show how modifying some of these settings on the Atmospheric Fog object (which is found by the Exponential Height Fog object in the Modes pane on the left):</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/daf00844-517b-4322-b646-9015d6b48e39.png"/></p>
<p>And now it's extreme and you can't miss it! I highly recommend just experimenting with all of these settings. There is so much to explore here, and it's good fun to see just how all the different parameters affect the outcome in real time. Unlike with many of the Lightmass effects and settings, Atmospheric Fog does not require a build (via the Build button at the top) to update and is very easy and fast to play with.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Using Volumetric Fog</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Volumetric Fog is a great visual effect that currently is very specifically designed for areas a player may be walking in a relatively flat map, or areas they may be looking up from or down to with some elevation changes. Given the difficulty of computation, it's currently not otherwise supported (for example, varying based on camera view-angle), but it is still a very powerful tool and great system to be comfortable with explaining its significance to a team. To start, once more let's take a look at what is already in FrozenCove, and then we'll modify it a bit:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/ef2db160-b835-463a-a03c-8fbd15680052.png"/></p>
<p>These settings give a nice subtle fog that only begins fairly distant from the placement of the height fog object. So, once again for demonstration purposes, we'll make it a bit more extreme (and the more observant will notice the particles in the foreground that we'll discuss next):</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/5038ee62-5ec7-4cf5-a7f8-80a47996c3b0.png"/></p>
<p>The level uses traditional particles, which we discussed previously due to their blending performance cost, to simulate snow-banks; but as you'll see, we could do this with a Volumetric Fog particle emitter too, which you can view in the map now. However, for this emitter to work, we need to switch the height fog's Volumetric Fog setting to be true (currently the box is unchecked). Note that while we'll discuss later how to optimize a bit of your Lightmass output if necessary. If you use Volumetric Fog this way you should remain cognizant of the potential performance costs and use the techniques from <a href="e80319fb-a34f-4648-9d86-0830791ac4d4.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Shader Editing and Optimization Tips</em>. So let's take a look at a material we can add to a particle system to get dynamic changing and colored Volumetric Fog:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/f3046009-34db-4438-9a79-125b0d8493f8.png"/></p>
<p>Now, with this material as-is, added to the emitter in the scene, you get a rather hard-to-miss blue (which was the original intent), here:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/675055e6-c6ba-493f-b3b5-b3a73517ea16.png"/></p>
<p>It turns out, if you disconnect the emissive color, this is a much more subtle effect, matching the fog's natural color. This is what is in the GitHub project presently:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/265e74ab-cff8-4eb0-b641-a72eee7dc5ce.png" style="width:33.42em;height:21.00em;"/></p>
<p>Volumetric Fog both local and global can really make or break the immersion of a scene, so while the whole point here is to be confident using them, it's a big help to have some experienced environmental artists around to make sure they're not <em>overused</em> in a scene aesthetically, in addition to possible performance costs already discussed.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Lightmass tools</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Now that the basics are out of the way and we've seen the power of Volumetric Fog and a bit of how it combines with lighting in general, it's time to get into a bit more detail with Lightmass itself. There are myriad objects, variables, and endless combinations of the two that can be explored, but to stay focused on our technical confidence, we'll focus on a few key areas here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diffuse Interreflection settings</li>
<li>The dynamic Indirect Lighting Lightmap and how to visualize and tune it</li>
<li>Ambient Occlusion and its benefits and drawbacks</li>
<li>Additional factors that can impact lighting build times</li>
<li>Quality Modes</li>
<li>Lightmaps, where to find them, and how to profile your usage of them</li>
</ul>
<p>Our second sub-section here will deal exclusively with lightmaps, so for our first section, we'll examine a solid subset of Lightmass' defining properties, as well as the impact of Quality Modes.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Learning Lightmass settings and previewing tools</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>First, let's take a look at the global Lightmass settings, found in World Settings:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/8db4aae3-79d1-4c93-b32c-685138cffd15.png"/></p>
<p>The first five options affect indirect lighting the most. If your lighting times are very large, setting the static lighting level to greater than 1 can drastically reduce your lighting build times by scaling the sampling size. If lighting build times for various levels or a whole game are becoming a problem, and your game and team can live with the quality reduction in lighting accuracy, try this first. The number of bounces can similarly have a significant impact. The purpose of indirect lighting is to simulate the real world where a fraction of photons (the particles of light our eyes perceive) are deflected or refracted from objects, while some are absorbed. The number of bounces means as each point in space is calculated, an amount of bounced lighting must also be calculated. Naturally, the more bounces, the more work (but also more realistic accuracy). The next three are a bit more esoteric, but feel free to simply mouse over them to see what they entail. Light smoothing, for example, can be a big help in very specific types of maps, but as stated, the cost to indirect shadow detail needs to be weighed. Unfortunately, unlike a lot of the fog settings we previously discussed, all of these will need to be built to be fully appreciated for the changes they make, which can be quite time consuming. Theoretically, if a game has a set style, a few experiments can be done early on, preferred values chosen, and then those are simply locked in for the duration of the project.</p>
<p>To visualize lighting effects, be sure to check out Detail Lighting, Lighting Only, and Reflections under the view options of your viewport:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/9a16f063-bb86-432a-96ab-6ea956a1c5fe.png"/></p>
<p>However, of most interest here probably is the volumetric Lightmass, which can be previewed via a viewport's Show | Visualize | Volumetric Lightmap, like so:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/4be9594f-fa72-4fcd-9209-a60bf98e9468.png"/></p>
<p>These directional lighting samples will be used to move objects at runtime and also for static meshes when moved around before building static lighting again. For experienced UE4 developers, don't forget, since 4.18 this is the default, and a generally better accepted model than the old lighting cache. A detailed description about the changes is in the <em>Further reading</em> section.</p>
<p>Quickly touching on Ambient Occlusion (which is actually turned off in FrozenCove), think of it as darkening areas. Concave surfaces block the light bounces in real life. While it adds realism, and adds essentially zero build time to lighting if you're already doing at least one indirect lighting bounce, keep in mind it is modeled on a top-down light to simplify the calculations. So in a sense it's similarly limited to Exponential Height Fog in that if your game is not a fundamentally flat game (for example, a player moving on a similar surface to the Earth, like most of us do), it can lose its realism and value. It is, however, easy enough to turn off in the Use Ambient Occlusion setting under your world's Lightmass settings. As with many Lightmass options, it's often best to simply try building lighting with it on, wandering the level, and maybe taking some specific screenshots, then turning it off and repeating this to see if it is of use. You can preview what work is done here in your viewport in its View Mode | Buffer Visualization | Ambient Occlusion.</p>
<p>If you find yourself having lighting build time problems, and have adjusted some of the parameters that can impact those build times, it's worth noting that lighting builds use the Swarm Agent system, which can farm the computations out to multiple computers on a network. More on this is also listed in the <em>Further reading</em> section. Note also that for many games, purely dynamic lighting is good enough, and much of Lightmass can be turned off for things such as mobile games that require a modest level of dynamic lighting detail but don't benefit from the memory cost and build time of baked/cooked lighting. As always, know your project and its needs, and be ready to do some early experiments and make those calls with your artists on the best options. If eliminating cooked lighting allows your artists to add more detailed textures to environments or characters, this may be a trade-off they're happy to make depending on your game's resolution and other settings, so don't be afraid to experiment and discuss!</p>
<p>And lastly, know your lighting quality levels. They can be selected from the drop-down of the Build button like so:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/62f7365a-4973-44f9-9809-c3aeee1db97d.png"/></p>
<p>These are really just a high-to-low of build-time versus quality-level at a very high level. If you want to switch in a hurry between these, by all means, this should be your first choice for quality versus time.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Profiling lightmaps</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As noted, Lightmass will automatically make lightmaps in all the areas enclosed in an importance volume. But what does that mean for your project's memory? You can always check the built data size for a quick estimate (hint: most of this will be your lightmaps, and maybe a chunk for nav-mesh, and a few smaller necessities internal to the level). For example, look in our project's <kbd>Conent/InfinithBladeIceLands/Maps</kbd> folder and you'll see frozen cove's built data <kbd>.ubulk</kbd> file, about 100 MB. This is typical for what we have in our map. However, if you would like some more detail, click the down arrow (more options) in the lightmass world settings, and under that you'll find a Lightmaps fly-out like so:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/c7756117-2d2b-4df0-857a-13f00e815b72.png"/></p>
<p>And double-clicking on one of those will give you a lot more detail:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/deb49844-fa85-4d70-8875-3e209ae1b305.png"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Here you can see compression, size (resolution and memory), and of course, change many of these settings. Individual meshes can change their lightmap resolution in the static mesh editor under their mesh settings. In addition, you can view the texel density of these lightmaps in your viewport via View Mode | Optimization Viewmodes | Lightmap Density, as can be seen here:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/aa90c0a2-d8e4-4a93-bebb-ceade6c22554.png"/></p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There is so much here to explore, it is important not to get overwhelmed. At this point, any major questions a team or project may have should be generally answerable. That said, if you finds yourself arguing with artists about visual quality, or arguing with the whole team about build times, the tools should be now in your hands to explore options, tune, tweak, and come to the optimal solution. Lighting in UE4 is amazing and complex, but thankfully, it's not critical to understand the <em>how</em> of the entire system, but simply command a mastery of the <em>what</em> and <em>why</em> to make the right decisions. In the next chapter, we'll have a bit more relaxed time showing off some more cool visual tricks UE4 can do with in-scene videos!</p>
