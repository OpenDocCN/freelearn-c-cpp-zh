<p class="calibre2">This book is an introduction to the Godot game engine and its new version, 3.0. Godot 3.0 has a large number of new features and capabilities that make it a strong alternative to more expensive commercial game engines. For beginners, it offers a friendly way to learn game development techniques. For more experienced developers, Godot is a powerful, customizable tool for bringing visions to life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This book will have a project-based approach. It consists of five projects that will help developers achieve a sound understanding of how to use the Godot engine to build games.</p>

<p class="calibre2">To best understand the example code in this book, you should have a general knowledge of programming, preferably with a modern, dynamically-typed language, such as Python or JavaScript. If you're new to programming entirely, you may wish to review a beginner Python tutorial before diving into the game projects in this book.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Godot will run on any relatively modern PC running Windows, macOS, or Linux operating systems. Your video card must support OpenGL ES 3.0.</p>
