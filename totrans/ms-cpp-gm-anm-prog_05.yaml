- en: In this part, you will build the foundation for the game character animation
    by enhancing the model viewer into an animation editor. You will learn how to
    add a separate viewing mode, allowing you to disable parts of the code that may
    not need or want to be active at some time, such as the user interface when recording
    videos. You will be also introduced to the general idea of the ability to revert
    changes made to model instances, ending up in a basic implementation of an undo/redo
    functionality. You will also learn how to store the currently loaded models and
    instances plus various settings to a YAML file, and how to load the data back
    into the application, allowing you to continue editing the models at any time,
    or to create multiple configurations. Finally, you will explore different camera
    types for the virtual world, giving you the chance to view the character animations
    from all angles and perspectives you may think of.
