- en: There are many buzzwords in computing today, most of which revolve around various
    software technologies and concepts. Browsers have become the preferred means of
    accessing information and consuming all manner of data. But there is still a void
    that can only be filled by standalone applications that must be installed and
    run on an operating system. The browser itself as an application cannot be accessed
    through a browser and bears witness to this assertion.

- en: Applications such as VLC, Adobe Photoshop, Google Earth, and QGIS are a few
    examples of applications that run directly on an operating system. Interestingly
    enough, these well-known software brands are built with Qt.

- en: Qt (pronounced "cute") is a cross-platform application framework and widget
    toolkit that is used in creating graphical user interface applications that run
    on a number of different hardware and operating systems. The aforementioned applications
    were written using this same toolkit.

- en: The main aim of this book is to introduce Qt to the reader. Through the use
    of simple and easy-to-understand examples, it will walk the user from one concept
    to the next without focusing too much on theory. The size of the book requires
    us to be concise in our presentation of materials. Coupled with the ample examples
    presented, we hope to shorten the path to understanding and learning how to use
    Qt.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Anyone looking to embark on the development of graphical user interface applications
    will find this book useful. No prior exposure to other toolkits is required in
    order to understand this book. However, having such skills will prove useful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book does, however, presume that you have a working knowledge in the use
    of C++. If you can express your thoughts in developing algorithms and the use
    of object-oriented programming, you will find the content easy to consume.

    that are available out there. This book is not a reference guide, and should only
    be used as introductory material.

- en: The beginning of each chapter will begin with a little theory that should help
    consolidate your understanding. Thereafter, a series of examples are used to explain
    the concepts and to help the reader grasp the topic better.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book also avoids continuing with examples from previous chapters. Each
    chapter's examples are short and do not require the reader to have knowledge of
    previous chapters. That way, you can pick any chapter you link and work through
    it.
