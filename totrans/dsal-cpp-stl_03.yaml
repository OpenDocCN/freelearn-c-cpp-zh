    programming. We begin by distinguishing between the capacity and size of `std::vector`,
    which is fundamental to writing efficient code. As we progress, we’ll understand
    the mechanics of memory reservation and optimization, and why these actions matter
    in real-world applications. The chapter culminates with thoroughly exploring custom

    becomes crucial to grasp the distinctions between a vector’s size and capacity.
    While closely related, these terms serve different roles in managing and optimizing
    dynamic arrays, and understanding them will dramatically enhance both the efficiency
    and clarity of your code.

- en: Recall from the previous chapter that the size of a vector denotes the number
    of elements it currently holds. When you add or remove elements, this size adjusts
    accordingly. So, if you have a vector containing five integers, its size is `5`.
    Remove an integer, and the size becomes `4`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'But herein lies a compelling facet of `std::vector`: while its size changes
    based on its elements, the memory it allocates doesn’t always follow suit immediately.
    To understand this thoroughly, we need to explore the concept of capacity. Let
    us do that in the next section.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What exactly is capacity?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`std::vector`, pertains to the amount of memory the vector has reserved for
    itself – the number of elements it can hold before reallocating memory. This doesn’t
    always equal the number of elements it currently holds (its size). `std::vector`
    often allocates more memory than is required, a preemptive strategy to accommodate
    future elements. This is where the genius of `std::vector` shines; over-allocating
    reduces the need for frequent and, potentially, computationally costly reallocations.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s use an analogy to make this more straightforward. Think of a vector as
    a train with compartments (memory blocks). When the train (vector) starts its
    journey, it might only have a few passengers (elements). However, anticipating
    more passengers at upcoming stations, the train starts with some empty compartments.
    The train’s capacity is the total number of compartments, while its size is the
    number of compartments with passengers.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might wonder why we don’t just expand the memory each time a new element
    is added. The answer lies in computational efficiency. Memory operations, especially
    reallocations, can be time-consuming. The vector minimizes these operations by
    allocating more memory than is immediately needed, ensuring that adding elements
    remains a fast operation in most scenarios. This optimization is one reason why
    `std::vector` has become a staple in C++ programming.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, there’s a flip side. Over-allocation means that some memory might go
    unused, at least temporarily. Understanding and managing capacity becomes paramount
    if memory usage is a critical concern. In some extreme cases, a vector might have
    a size of `10` but a capacity of `1000`!

    and capacity. Consider a newly initiated `std::vector<int> numbers;`. If you push
    10 integers into it one by one and periodically check its capacity, you might
    notice something interesting: the capacity doesn’t increase by one for each integer!
    Instead, it might jump from `1` to `2`, then to `4`, then to `8`, and so on. This
    exponential growth strategy is a typical implementation approach, ensuring that
    the vector’s capacity doubles whenever it runs out of space.'

    be discarded if you reduce its size.'

    vector upfront. It’s like booking seats in advance. The size remains unchanged,

    Whether for performance enhancements, memory optimization, or specific application
    needs, understanding the potential of custom allocators is a valuable asset in
    a C++ developer’s toolkit. As you continue your journey with `std::vector`, remember
    that an allocator works diligently to manage memory efficiently beneath every
    element. With custom allocators, you can tailor this management to suit your application’s
    needs.
