			<h1 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"/>Introduction to Godot 4.0</h1>
			<p>Whether it’s a career goal or a recreational hobby, game development is a fun and rewarding endeavor. There’s never been a better time to get started in game development. Modern programming languages and tools have made it easier than ever to build high-quality games and distribute them to the world. If you’re reading this book, then you’ve set your feet on the path to making the game(s) of <span class="No-Break">your dreams.</span></p>
			<p>This book is an introduction to the Godot Game Engine and its new 4.0 version, which was released in 2023. Godot 4.0 has a<a id="_idIndexMarker000"/> large number of new features and capabilities that make it a strong alternative to expensive commercial game engines. For beginners, it offers a friendly way to learn game development fundamentals. For more experienced developers, Godot is a powerful, customizable, and <em class="italic">open</em> toolkit for bringing your visions <span class="No-Break">to life.</span></p>
			<p>This book takes a project-based approach that will introduce you to the fundamentals of the engine. It consists of five game projects that are designed to help you achieve a sound understanding of game development concepts and how they’re applied in Godot. Along the way, you will learn how Godot works and absorb important techniques that you can apply to your <span class="No-Break">own projects.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we’ll cover the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>General advice for <span class="No-Break">getting started</span></li>
				<li>What is a <span class="No-Break">game engine?</span></li>
				<li>What <span class="No-Break">is Godot?</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Downloading Godot</span></li>
				<li>Overview of the <span class="No-Break">Godot UI</span></li>
				<li>Nodes <span class="No-Break">and scenes</span></li>
				<li>Scripting <span class="No-Break">in Godot</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>General advice</h1>
			<p>This section contains some general advice to readers, based on the author’s experience as a teacher and lecturer. Keep these tips in mind as you work through the book, especially if you’re very new <span class="No-Break">to programming.</span></p>
			<p>Try to follow the projects in the book in order. Later chapters may build on topics that were introduced in earlier chapters, where they are explained in more detail. When you encounter something that you don’t remember, go back and review that topic in the earlier chapter. No one is timing you, and there’s no prize for finishing the <span class="No-Break">book quickly.</span></p>
			<p>There is a lot of material to absorb here. Don’t feel discouraged if you don’t get it at first. The goal is not to become an expert in game development overnight – that’s just not possible. Just like with any other skill – carpentry or a musical instrument, for example – it takes years of practice and study to develop proficiency. Repetition is the key to learning complex topics; the more you work with Godot’s features, the more familiar and easier they will start to seem. Try repeating one of the earlier chapters after you reach the end. You’ll be surprised at how much more you’ll understand compared to the first time you <span class="No-Break">read it.</span></p>
			<p>If you’re reading this as an e-book, resist the temptation to copy and paste the code. Typing the code yourself will engage your brain more actively. It’s similar to how taking notes during a lecture helps you learn better than just listening, even if you never look back at the notes. If you’re a slow typist, it will also help you work on your typing speed. In a nutshell: you’re a programmer, so get used to <span class="No-Break">typing code!</span></p>
			<p>One of the biggest mistakes that new game developers make is taking on a bigger project than they can handle. It is very important to keep the scope of your project as small as possible when starting out. You will be much more successful (and learn more) if you finish two or three small games than if you have a large, incomplete project that has grown beyond your ability <span class="No-Break">to manage.</span></p>
			<p>You’ll notice that the five games in the book follow this strategy very strictly. They are all small in scope, both for practical reasons – to fit reasonably into book-sized lessons – but also to remain focused on practicing the basics. As you build the game, you will likely find yourself thinking of additional features and gameplay elements right away. <em class="italic">What if the spaceship had upgrades?</em> <em class="italic">What if the character could do </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">wall jumps?</em></span></p>
			<p>Ideas are great, but if you haven’t finished the basic project yet, write them down and save them for later. Don’t let yourself be sidetracked by one “cool idea” after another. Developers call this <em class="italic">feature creep</em>, meaning a list of features that never stops growing, and it’s a trap that has led to many an unfinished project. Don’t fall victim <span class="No-Break">to it.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, don’t forget to take a break now and again. You shouldn’t try and power through the whole book, or even one project, in just a few sittings. After each new concept, and especially after each chapter, give yourself time to absorb the new information before you dive into the next one. You’ll find that you not only retain more information, but you’ll probably enjoy the <span class="No-Break">process more.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>The secret to learning effectively</h2>
			<p>Here’s the secret to getting the most out of these projects and increasing your skills in a way that makes them stick: at the end of each chapter, once you’ve finished building the game project, immediately delete it and start over. This time, try and re-create it without looking at the book. If you get stuck, just look at that part in the chapter, and then close the book again. If you really feel confident, try adding your own spin to the game – change some parts of the gameplay or add a <span class="No-Break">new twist.</span></p>
			<p>If you do this multiple times with each of the games, you’ll be amazed at how less often you’ll need to check the book. If you can make the projects in this book on your own without help, then you’re surely ready to branch out and take on your <span class="No-Break">original concepts.</span></p>
			<p>Keep these tips in mind as you read through the following sections. In the next section, you’ll learn what a game engine is and why game developers might want to choose to <span class="No-Break">use one.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>What is a game engine?</h1>
			<p>Game development <a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>is complex and involves a wide variety of knowledge and skills. To build a modern game, you need<a id="_idIndexMarker002"/> a great deal of underlying technology before you can make the actual game itself. Imagine that you had to build your computer and write your own operating system before you could even start programming. Game development would be a lot like that if you truly had to start from scratch and make everything that <span class="No-Break">you need.</span></p>
			<p>There are also a number of common needs that every game has. For example, no matter what the game is, it’s going to need to draw things on the screen. If the code to do that has already been written, it makes more sense to reuse it than to create it all over again for every game. That’s where game frameworks and engines <span class="No-Break">come in.</span></p>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">game framework</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>set of libraries with helper code that assists in building the foundational parts of a game. It doesn’t necessarily provide all the pieces, and you may still have to write a great deal of code to tie everything together. Because of this, building a game with a game framework can take more time than one built with a full <span class="No-Break">game engine.</span></p>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">game engine</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker004"/>collection of tools and technologies designed to ease the process of game-making by removing the need to reinvent the wheel for each new game project. It provides a collection of commonly needed functionality that often would require a significant investment in time and effort <span class="No-Break">to develop.</span></p>
			<p>Here are some of the main features a<a id="_idIndexMarker005"/> typical game engine <span class="No-Break">will provide:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Rendering (2D and 3D)</strong>: Rendering <a id="_idIndexMarker006"/>is the process of displaying the game on the player’s screen. A good rendering pipeline must take into account modern GPU support, high-resolution displays, and effects such as lighting, perspective, and viewports, all while maintaining a very <span class="No-Break">high framerate.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Physics</strong>: While a <a id="_idIndexMarker007"/>very common requirement, building a robust and accurate physics engine is a monumental task. Most games require some sort of collision detection and response system, and many need physics simulations, but few developers want to take on the task of writing one - especially if they have never tried to do <span class="No-Break">so before!</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Platform support</strong>: In today’s market, most <a id="_idIndexMarker008"/>developers want to be able to release their games on multiple platforms, such as desktops, consoles, mobile, and/or the web. A game engine provides a unified exporting process to publish games on multiple platforms without needing to rewrite game code or support <span class="No-Break">multiple versions.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Common development environment</strong>: By using the same unified interface to make<a id="_idIndexMarker009"/> multiple games, the developer doesn’t have to re-learn a new workflow every time they start a <span class="No-Break">new project.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition to these, there will be tools to assist with features such as networking, easing the process of managing images and sound, animations, debugging, and many more. Often, game engines will include the ability to import content from other tools, such as those used to create animations or <span class="No-Break">3D models.</span></p>
			<p>Using a <a id="_idIndexMarker010"/>game engine allows the developer to focus on building their game rather than creating the underlying framework needed to make it work. For small or independent developers, this can mean the difference between releasing a game after one year of development instead of three, or even never <span class="No-Break">at all.</span></p>
			<p>There are dozens of popular game engines on the market today, such as Unity, Unreal Engine, and GameMaker Studio, just to name a few. An important fact to be aware of is that the majority of popular game engines are commercial products. They may or may not require any financial investment to get started, but they will require some kind of licensing and/or royalty payments if your game makes money. Whatever engine you choose, you need to carefully read the user agreement and make sure you understand what you are and are not allowed to do with the engine, and what hidden costs, if any, you may be <span class="No-Break">responsible for.</span></p>
			<p>On the other hand, some engines are non-commercial and <em class="italic">open source</em>, such as the Godot game engine, which is what this book is <span class="No-Break">all about.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>What is Godot?</h1>
			<p>Godot is a <a id="_idIndexMarker011"/>fully featured modern game engine, providing all of the features described in the previous section and more. It is also completely free and open source, released under the very permissive MIT license. This means there are no fees, no hidden costs, and no royalties to pay on your game’s revenue. Everything you make with Godot 100% belongs to you, which is not the case with many commercial game engines that require an ongoing contractual relationship. For many developers, this is <span class="No-Break">very appealing.</span></p>
			<p>If you’re not familiar with the concept of open source, community-driven development, this may seem strange to you. However, much like the Linux kernel, Firefox browser, and many other very well-known pieces of software, Godot is not developed by a company as a commercial product. Instead, a dedicated community of passionate developers donates their time and expertise to building the engine, testing and fixing bugs, producing documentation, <span class="No-Break">and more.</span></p>
			<p>As a game developer, the benefits of using Godot are many. Because it is unencumbered by commercial licensing, you have complete control over exactly how and where your game is distributed. Many commercial game engines restrict the types of projects you can make or require a much more expensive license to build games in certain categories, such <span class="No-Break">as gambling.</span></p>
			<p>Godot’s <a id="_idIndexMarker012"/>open source nature also means there is a level of transparency that doesn’t exist with commercial game engines. For example, if you find that a particular engine feature doesn’t quite meet your needs, you are free to modify the engine itself and add the new features you need, with no permission required. This can also be very helpful when debugging a large project because you have full access to the engine’s <span class="No-Break">internal workings.</span></p>
			<p>It also means that you can directly contribute to Godot’s future. See <em class="italic">additional topics</em> in <a href="B19289_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor207"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a> for more information about how you can get involved with <span class="No-Break">Godot development.</span></p>
			<p>Now that you have an understanding of what Godot is and how it can help you build a game, it’s time to get started. In the next section, you’ll see how to download Godot and set it up for use on your <span class="No-Break">own computer.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Downloading Godot</h1>
			<p>You can download<a id="_idIndexMarker013"/> the latest version of Godot by visiting <a href="https://godotengine.org/">https://godotengine.org/</a> and<a id="_idIndexMarker014"/> clicking <strong class="bold">Download Latest</strong>. This book is written for version 4.0. If the version you download has another number at the end (such as 4.0.3), that’s fine – this just means that it includes updates to version 4.0 that fix bugs or <span class="No-Break">other issues.</span></p>
			<p>On the download page, you will also see a standard version and a .NET version. The .NET version is specially built to be used with the C# programming language. Don’t download this one unless you plan to use C# with Godot. The projects in this book do not <span class="No-Break">use C#.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.1: The Godot download page</p>
			<p>Unzip the<a id="_idIndexMarker015"/> downloaded file, and you’ll have the Godot application. Optionally, you can drag it to your <strong class="source-inline">Programs</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">Applications</strong> folder, if you have one. Double-click the application to launch it and you’ll see Godot’s <strong class="bold">Project Manager</strong> window, which you’ll learn about in the <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>Alternate installation methods</h2>
			<p>There <a id="_idIndexMarker016"/>are a few other ways to get Godot on your computer besides downloading it from the Godot website. Note that there is no difference in functionality when installed this way. The following are merely alternatives for downloading <span class="No-Break">the application:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Steam</strong>: If you <a id="_idIndexMarker017"/>have an account on<a id="_idIndexMarker018"/> Steam, you can install Godot via the Steam desktop application. Search for Godot in the Steam store and follow the instructions to install it. You can launch Godot from the <span class="No-Break">Steam application:</span></li>
			</ul>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.2: The Godot engine on Steam</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Itch.io</strong>: You <a id="_idIndexMarker019"/>can also <a id="_idIndexMarker020"/>download Godot from the<a id="_idIndexMarker021"/> popular itch.io website. Itch is a marketplace for independent game developers and creators. Search for Godot and download it from the <span class="No-Break">provided links.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Package Managers</strong>: If you’re <a id="_idIndexMarker022"/>using one of the following operating system package managers, you can install Godot via its normal installation process. See the documentation for your package manager for details. Godot is available in these <span class="No-Break">package </span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker023"/></span><span class="No-Break">managers:</span><ul><li><span class="No-Break">Homebrew (macOS)</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Scoop (Windows)</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Snap (Linux)</span></li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Android and web versions</p>
			<p class="callout">You will also see downloads available for Godot versions that run on Android and in your web browser. At the time of this writing, these versions are listed as “experimental” and may not be stable or fully functional. It is recommended that you use the desktop version of Godot, especially while <span class="No-Break">you’re learning.</span></p>
			<p>Congratulations, you have<a id="_idIndexMarker024"/> successfully installed Godot on your computer. In the next section, you will see an overview of Godot’s editor interface – the purposes of the various windows and buttons you’ll use when working with <span class="No-Break">the editor.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Overview of the Godot UI</h1>
			<p>Like most <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>game engines, Godot has a unified development environment. This means that you use the same interface to work on all of the aspects of your game – code, visuals, audio, and so on. This section is an introduction to the interface and its parts. Take note of the terminology used here; it will be used throughout this book when referring to actions you’ll take in the <span class="No-Break">editor window.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Project Manager</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Project Manager</strong> window<a id="_idIndexMarker026"/> is the first window<a id="_idIndexMarker027"/> you’ll see when you <span class="No-Break">open Godot:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer009" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19289_01_03.jpg" alt="Figure 1.3: Project Manager"/>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.3: Project Manager</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Opening Godot for the first time</p>
			<p class="callout">The first time you open Godot, you won’t have any projects yet. You’ll see a pop-up window asking if you want to <em class="italic">explore official example projects in the Asset Library</em>. Select <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong>, and you’ll see the <strong class="bold">Project Manager</strong> as it appears in the <span class="No-Break">preceding screenshot.</span></p>
			<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker028"/>window, you <a id="_idIndexMarker029"/>can see a list of your existing Godot projects. You can choose an existing project and click <strong class="bold">Run</strong> to play the game or <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> to work on it in the Godot editor. You can also create a new project by clicking <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">New Project</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer010" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19289_01_04.jpg" alt="Figure 1.4: New project settings"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.4: New project settings</p>
			<p>Here, you can give the project a name and create a folder to store it in. Note the warning message – a Godot project is stored as a separate folder on the computer. All the files that the project uses must be located in this folder. This makes it convenient to share Godot projects because you only need to zip the project folder and you can be confident that another Godot user will be able to open it and not be missing any <span class="No-Break">necessary data.</span></p>
			<h3>Renderer</h3>
			<p>When<a id="_idIndexMarker030"/> creating a new project, you also have the choice of <strong class="bold">Renderer</strong>. The three options represent the balance between advanced, high-performance graphics that require a modern desktop GPU, and compatibility with less-capable platforms such as mobile and older desktops. You can change this option later if you need, so it’s OK to leave it as the default setting. If you later decide to build games for the mobile platform, the Godot documentation has a great deal of information regarding performance and rendering options. See <a href="B19289_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor207"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a> for links and <span class="No-Break">more information.</span></p>
			<h3>Choosing filenames</h3>
			<p>When<a id="_idIndexMarker031"/> you’re naming your new project, there are a few simple rules you should try and follow that may save you some trouble in the future. Give your project a name that describes what it is – <em class="italic">Wizard Battle Arena</em> is a much better project name than <em class="italic">Game #2</em>. In the future, you’ll never be able to remember which game number two was, so be as descriptive <span class="No-Break">as possible.</span></p>
			<p>You should also think about how you name your project folder and the files in it. Some operating systems are case-sensitive and distinguish between <strong class="source-inline">My_Game</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">my_game</strong>, while others do not. This can lead to problems if you move your project from one computer to another. For this reason, many programmers develop a standardized naming scheme for their projects, such as not using spaces in filenames and using <strong class="source-inline">_</strong> between words. Regardless of what naming scheme you adopt, the most important thing is to <span class="No-Break">be consistent.</span></p>
			<p>Once you’ve created the project folder, the <strong class="bold">Create Edit</strong> button will open the new project in the editor window. Try it now: create a project <span class="No-Break">called </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">test_project</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Console window</p>
			<p class="callout">If you’re using a version of the Windows operating system, you’ll also see a console window open when you run Godot. In this window, you can see warnings and errors produced by the engine and/or your project. This window doesn’t appear on macOS or Linux, but you can see the console output if you launch the application from the command line using a <span class="No-Break">Terminal program</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Editor window</h2>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker032"/>following figure is a screenshot of the main Godot editor window. This <a id="_idIndexMarker033"/>is where you will spend most of your time when building projects in Godot. The editor interface is divided into several sections, each offering different functionality. The specific terminology for each section is described after <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.5</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>

			<p>The main <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>portion of the editor window is the <em class="italic">Viewport</em>. This is where you’ll see the parts of your game as you’re working <span class="No-Break">on them.</span></p>
			<p>In the top <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>center of the window is a list of the <em class="italic">Workspaces</em> you can switch between when working on different parts of your game. You can switch between <strong class="bold">2D</strong> and <strong class="bold">3D</strong> mode, as well as <strong class="bold">Script</strong> mode, where you’ll edit your game’s code. <strong class="bold">AssetLib</strong> is a place where you can download add-ons and example projects contributed by the Godot community.

On the bottom of the left-hand dock, you’ll find the <strong class="bold">FileSystem</strong> tab. All the files in the project folder are shown here, and you can click on folders to open them and see what they contain. All resources in your project will be located relative to the <strong class="source-inline">res://</strong> path, which is the project’s root folder. For example, a file path might look like this: <strong class="source-inline">res://player/player.tscn</strong>.

			<p>As you <a id="_idIndexMarker038"/>work through the game projects in this book, you’ll learn about the functionality of these items and become familiar with navigating the <span class="No-Break">editor interface.</span></p>
			<p>After reading <a id="_idIndexMarker039"/>this section, you should feel comfortable with the layout of the Godot editor window and the names of the elements you’ll be seeing throughout the book. You’re one step closer to finishing this introduction and getting started on a game. First, though, did you notice those items in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.9</em>? Those are called nodes, and you’ll find out what they’re all about in the <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>Learning about nodes and scenes</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Nodes</strong> are the<a id="_idIndexMarker040"/> basic building blocks for creating games in Godot. A node is an object <a id="_idIndexMarker041"/>that can give you a variety of specialized game functions. A given type of node might display an image, play an animation, or represent a 3D model. The node contains a collection of properties, allowing you to customize its behavior. Which nodes you add to your project depends on what functionality you need. It’s a modular system designed to give you flexibility in building your <span class="No-Break">game objects.</span></p>
			<p>The nodes you add are organized into a <em class="italic">tree</em> structure. In a tree, nodes are added as <em class="italic">children</em> of other nodes. A particular node can have any number of children, but only one <em class="italic">parent</em> node. When a group of nodes is collected into a tree, it is <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>called <span class="No-Break">a </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">scene</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>

			<p><strong class="bold">Scenes</strong> in Godot<a id="_idIndexMarker043"/> are typically used to create and organize the various game objects in your project. You might have a player scene that contains all the nodes and scripts that<a id="_idIndexMarker044"/> make the player’s character work. Then, you might create another scene that defines the game’s map: the obstacles and items that the player must navigate through. You can then combine these various scenes into the <span class="No-Break">final game.</span></p>
			<p>While nodes come with a variety of properties and functions, any node’s behavior and capabilities can be extended by attaching a <em class="italic">script</em> to the node. This allows you to write code that makes the node do more than it can do in its default state. For example, you can add a <strong class="source-inline">Sprite2D</strong> node to display an image, but if you want that image to move or disappear when clicked, you’ll need to add a script to create <span class="No-Break">that behavior.</span></p>
			<p>Nodes are powerful tools, and understanding them is the key to effectively building game objects in Godot. However, on their own, they can only do so much. It’s still up to you to provide the game logic – the rules that objects in your game will follow. In the next section, you can see how that’s done by writing code using Godot’s <span class="No-Break">scripting language.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>Scripting in Godot</h1>
			<p>Godot<a id="_idIndexMarker045"/> provides <a id="_idIndexMarker046"/>two official languages for scripting <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>nodes: <strong class="bold">GDScript</strong> and <strong class="bold">C#</strong>. GDScript<a id="_idIndexMarker048"/> is the dedicated built-in language, providing the tightest integration with the engine, and is the most straightforward to use. For those that are already familiar or proficient with C#, you can download a version that supports <span class="No-Break">that language.</span></p>
			<p>In addition to<a id="_idIndexMarker049"/> the two supported languages, Godot itself is written in C++, and you can get even more performance and control by extending the engine’s functionality directly. See <em class="italic">Additional topics</em> in <a href="B19289_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor207"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a> for information on using other languages and extending <span class="No-Break">the engine.</span></p>
			<p>All the games in <a id="_idIndexMarker050"/>this book will use GDScript. For the majority of projects, GDScript is the best choice of language. It is tightly integrated with Godot’s <strong class="bold">Application Programming Interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">API</strong>) and is designed for <span class="No-Break">rapid development.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>About GDScript</h2>
			<p>GDScript’s syntax is <a id="_idIndexMarker051"/>very closely modeled on the Python language. If you are familiar with Python already, you will find GDScript very familiar. If you are comfortable with another dynamic language, such as JavaScript, you should find it relatively easy to learn. Python is very often recommended as a good beginner language, and GDScript shares <span class="No-Break">that user-friendliness.</span></p>
			<p>This book assumes you have at least some programming experience already. If you’ve never coded before, you may find it a little more difficult. Learning a game engine is a large task on its own; learning to code at the same time means you’ve taken on a major challenge. If you find yourself struggling with the code in this book, you may find that working through an introductory programming lesson in a language such as Python or Javascript will help you grasp <span class="No-Break">the basics.</span></p>
			<p>Like Python, GDScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning you do not need to declare a variable’s type when creating it, and it uses whitespace (indentation) to denote code blocks. Overall, the advantage of using GDScript for your game’s logic is that, due to its tight integration with the engine, you write less code, which means faster development and fewer mistakes <span class="No-Break">to fix.</span></p>
			<p>To give you an idea of what GDScript looks like, here is a small script that causes a sprite to move from left to right across the screen at a <span class="No-Break">given speed:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
extends Sprite2D
var speed = 200
func _ready():
    position = Vector2(100, 100)
func_process(delta):
    position.x += speed * delta</pre>
			<p>If you’ve used <a id="_idIndexMarker052"/>other high-level languages such as Python before, this will look very familiar, but don’t worry if this code doesn’t make much sense to you yet. In the following chapters, you’ll be writing lots of code, which will be accompanied by explanations of how it <span class="No-Break">all works.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you were introduced to the concept of a game engine in general and to Godot in particular. Most importantly, you downloaded Godot and <span class="No-Break">launched it!</span></p>
			<p>You learned some important vocabulary that will be used throughout this book when referring to various parts of the Godot editor window. You also learned about the concepts of nodes and scenes, which are the fundamental building blocks <span class="No-Break">of Godot.</span></p>
			<p>You also received some advice on how to approach the projects in this book and game development in general. If you ever find yourself getting frustrated as you are working through this book, go back and reread the <em class="italic">General advice</em> section. There’s a lot to learn, and it’s OK if it doesn’t all make sense the first time. You’ll make five different games throughout this book, and each one will help you understand things a little <span class="No-Break">bit more.</span></p>
			<p>You’re ready to move on to the next chapter, where you’ll start building your first game <span class="No-Break">in Godot.</span></p>
