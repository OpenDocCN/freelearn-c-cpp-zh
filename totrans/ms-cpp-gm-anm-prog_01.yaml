- en: The first part of the book starts with an introduction to **Assimp**, the Open
    Asset Import Library. You will learn how to load a character model from a file,
    how to process the different elements of the character, such as meshes, textures,
    and nodes, and how to draw the model to the screen. You will also learn how to
    move the computational load to the GPU by using compute shaders, freeing the CPU
    for features introduced in the book. Finally, you will explore the idea and implementation
    of a visual selection, enabling you to select a model instance on the screen with
    a click of the mouse.
