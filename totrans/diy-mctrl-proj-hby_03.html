			<p>In this chapter, we will review and practice how to turn an LED on or off using a <strong class="bold">push button</strong> connected to a microcontroller board. A push button is a practical component that acts like a switch and is used for closing or opening an electronic circuit. We can use them to initialize or activate a process in a microcontroller board. Consequently, the input data provided by a push button is important in many microcontroller applications that require human intervention. Specifically, we will cover the following main topics in this chapter:</p>

				<li>Introducing push buttons</li>
				<li>Understanding electrical noise from push buttons</li>
				<li>Connecting an LED to a microcontroller board port and using an internal <strong class="bold">pull-up</strong> resistor</li>
				<li>Testing out the push button</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will have learned how to connect a push button to the Curiosity Nano and the Blue Pill microcontroller boards, as well as how to program the push button's input to turn an LED on or off. You will also have learned how to reduce the problem of <strong class="bold">electrical noise</strong> in push buttons. Trying to solve this problem is not trivial, as we will see in this chapter. In particular, the <em class="italic">Understanding electrical noise from push buttons</em> section explains that not all push buttons work 100% free of manufacturing errors, and electrical noise can be present in them when they are used.</p>

			<p>The next section provides a brief introduction to push buttons, which are used in electronic circuits.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Introducing push buttons</h1>
			<p>A push button is an <a id="_idIndexMarker174"/>electronic device that basically acts like a mechanical <strong class="bold">switch</strong>; it can be used for either closing or opening an electrical or electronic circuit. They are also called <em class="italic">momentary push buttons</em>, or <em class="italic">pushbuttons</em>. Push buttons are made with hard materials such as plastic and have a tiny metal spring inside that makes contact with two wires or contacts, allowing electricity to flow through them if the button is <a id="_idIndexMarker175"/>pressed (in <strong class="bold">normally open</strong> push buttons) or when it is <a id="_idIndexMarker176"/>depressed (in <strong class="bold">normally closed</strong> push buttons). When the push button is off, the spring retracts, the electrical contact is interrupted, and electrical current will not flow through the contacts. Push buttons are useful for manually controlling or initializing a process in an electrical or electronic circuit, including applications that contain microcontroller boards. The following image shows a normally closed (left) and a normally open (right) push button:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.1_B16413.jpg" alt="Figure 3.1 – Normally closed (left) and normally open (right) push buttons"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.1 – Normally closed (left) and normally open (right) push buttons</p>
			<p>As you can see in <em class="italic">Figure 3.1</em>, the normally <a id="_idIndexMarker177"/>open push button (on right) looks depressed. Note that the pins are connected to a microcontroller board.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Normally open and normally <a id="_idIndexMarker178"/>closed push buttons may look exactly the same, depending on their <a id="_idIndexMarker179"/>manufacturers and models. If you are unsure, try your button with a microcontroller board and see what type of push button it is. If the push button sends a logic signal to the microcontroller board without you needing to press it, this means that it is a normally closed push button. In this chapter, you will learn how to connect a push button to a microcontroller board.</p>
			<p>A typical application of a push button in microcontroller board projects is to connect or disconnect either the ground or a positive voltage from an I/O pin on the microcontroller board. This voltage change that's made by the push button can be seen by the microcontroller board through its I/O pin (port); this initializes a process in the microcontroller board.</p>
			<p>There are different types of push buttons in terms of size. Large and robust ones are used for some industrial applications where an operator needs to quickly identify and push them. Smaller buttons are typically used in electrical appliances and devices, such as computer keyboards and landline telephones. In this chapter, we will use a small push button that is commonly found in many electronic kits and in kits that include microcontroller boards. In fact, the Blue Pill and the Curiosity Nano microcontroller boards have small push buttons in their circuits. They can be used in both boards for resetting the programs that run on them. There are two main types of push buttons: <strong class="bold">normally open</strong> and <strong class="bold">normally closed</strong> push buttons. Let's look at them in more detail:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Normally open push buttons</strong>. In this <a id="_idIndexMarker180"/>type of button, its switch always remains open when it is not pressed; that is, it does not close an <a id="_idIndexMarker181"/>electrical circuit. It makes an electrical contact (closes a circuit) every time we press it. When we press the push button down, its internal switch closes. These are the most common types of push buttons. They can be useful for momentarily activating or initializing a process; for example, pressing the push button briefly to reset a microcontroller board.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Normally closed push buttons</strong>. In its <a id="_idIndexMarker182"/>default state, this <a id="_idIndexMarker183"/>button can close a circuit, meaning that its switch is normally closed without us having to press the push button. We open the switch (hence the circuit where it is connected to) when we press this type of push button. These buttons can be useful when we need to momentarily turn off or interrupt an electrical/electronic circuit. For example, we can open the connection of a sensor to a microcontroller board if we want to stop reading the sensor for whatever reason. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>The next section describes a problem that is present in many push buttons, known as <strong class="bold">electrical noise</strong>. This type of noise can sometimes be very difficult (but not impossible) to minimize.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>Understanding electrical noise from push buttons</h1>
			<p>Electrical noise can be <a id="_idIndexMarker184"/>generated in many push buttons. This can <a id="_idIndexMarker185"/>negatively affect the functionality of an electronic circuit where the push button is connected, and it can have unpredictable results in a microcontroller board.</p>
			<p>A common problem with push buttons is that <em class="italic">they are not perfect</em>. They don't close their switch instantly, and in many cases, electrical noise can be produced. This may happen because not all the push buttons are free of manufacturing errors. If we try to connect a push button directly to a microcontroller's I/O port, every time we press the button, it seems that we do it right. To us, it seems like we pressed it only once. However, to the microcontroller board, it looks like the button was pressed many times for extremely short periods of time, and this is because of electrical noise that is generated in the push button. Electrical noise can be defined as random electrical levels or signals coupling with an electronic circuit. This electrical disturbance or interference can vary greatly, from very small voltages to high voltage levels, and its frequency can also change randomly. There are many sources that generate electrical noise, including heat, faulty electronic components, mechanical movement, and loose electrical connections in a circuit, among other sources.</p>
			<p>The undesired electrical noise from push buttons is almost always generated by something called <strong class="bold">bouncing</strong>, which is <a id="_idIndexMarker186"/>caused by the friction and mechanical movements of the push button's internal metal parts and spring. We need to <strong class="bold">debounce</strong> the push button to diminish its electrical noise and thus properly close a circuit (if we are using a normally open push button) in a clean and efficient way. If we don't debounce a push button, its internal switch may close a circuit erratically every time we press the push button, which will affect the functionality of the entire circuit or microcontroller board's input. The data signal that's generated by a push button should be either zero volts (logical LOW) or 3.3 volts (logical HIGH). If we don't debounce a push button, it will create electrical noise that possibly changes those logical levels, and thus the microcontroller board may not recognize them as such. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important</p>
			<p class="callout">The HIGH <strong class="bold">logic level</strong> voltage <a id="_idIndexMarker187"/>used in both the Blue Pill and the Curiosity Nano boards is 3.3 volts. Remember that in some microcontroller boards, their HIGH logic level is 5 volts instead of 3.3 volts, such as the Arduino family of microcontroller boards.</p>
			<p>There are several techniques that <a id="_idIndexMarker188"/>deal with electrical noise in <a id="_idIndexMarker189"/>push buttons. For example, this type of noise can be greatly minimized by either connecting some electronic components to a push button, or via coding, as we will see in the next few sections.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Debouncing a push button via hardware</h2>
			<p>One way to <a id="_idIndexMarker190"/>reduce electrical noise from a push button is to <a id="_idIndexMarker191"/>connect a capacitor and two resistors (this is also called <strong class="bold">RC debouncing</strong> circuit, a resistor-capacitor network, or an RC filter) connected to the <a id="_idIndexMarker192"/>push button, as shown in the following diagram. When we press the push button, the capacitor will be charged. When we release the button, the capacitor will retain its charge for a very short period of time, and the resistor that is connected to it will discharge it after that time. That capacitor's charge represents a HIGH logic voltage, and it can be used in a microcontroller board. Any transient electrical noise that occurs during the capacitor's charge time can be ignored because the capacitor is providing a HIGH logical value in the meantime:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.2_B16413.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2 – An RC debouncer connected to a push button"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.2 – An RC debouncer connected to a push button</p>
			<p>The preceding diagram contains two resistors, <strong class="bold">R1</strong> and <strong class="bold">R2</strong>, a normally open push button, and a capacitor, <strong class="bold">C</strong>. The resistors and the capacitor form an RC debouncer. Remember that <strong class="bold">Vcc</strong> means positive voltage, which is 3.3 volts for the Curiosity Nano and Blue Pill. Generally, you can obtain Vcc from one of the pins of the microcontroller board labeled 3.3V or Vcc. In addition, you can connect the RC debouncer to one of the microcontroller pins labeled as ground. As we saw in the preceding diagram, the three electronic components can be used to reduce electrical noise in the push button. The typical values for <strong class="bold">R1</strong>, <strong class="bold">R2</strong>, and <strong class="bold">C</strong> are 10K ohms, 10K ohms, and 0.1 microfarads, respectively, although you may need to change those values if the RC debouncer is not working effectively, because the <a id="_idIndexMarker193"/>electrical noise is not always the same in each <a id="_idIndexMarker194"/>push button. The mathematical formula for calculating the RC debouncer is thoroughly explained Ganssle, J.G. (2008), <em class="italic">A guide to debouncing</em>.</p>
			<p>We included the RC debouncer in this section as a reference, just in case the debouncing method via software does not work for you. The next section will show you how to debounce a push button using software <em class="italic">only</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>Debouncing a push button via software </h2>
			<p>We can minimize the <a id="_idIndexMarker195"/>spurious electrical noise from a <a id="_idIndexMarker196"/>push button via coding. A trick that we can use in the code is to ignore the electrical noise for a very short period of time (usually some dozens of milliseconds), right after we press the push button connected to our circuit. The following diagram shows how to connect a push button directly to a microcontroller board's I/O port to perform debouncing via software: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.3_B16413.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3 – A push button connected to an I/O port with a pull-down resistor"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.3 – A push button connected to an I/O port with a pull-down resistor</p>
			<p>The preceding diagram <a id="_idIndexMarker197"/>shows a pull-down resistor, <strong class="bold">R</strong>, that is forcing the input port from the microcontroller board to receive zero volts (logical LOW), which is <a id="_idIndexMarker198"/>connected to ground, while the push button is not being pressed. A typical value for the pull-down resistor, <strong class="bold">R</strong>, is 10k ohms. We can use a pull-down resistor when we need to constantly input a LOW level to the microcontroller board's I/O port, and just change to a logical HIGH level when we press the push button. This can be useful for momentarily starting a process, for example, turning on a light connected to our circuit. The following diagram shows how to connect a pull-up resistor to a microcontroller port, forcing its input to be 3.3 volts (<strong class="bold">Vcc</strong>):</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.4_B16413.jpg" alt="Figure 3.4 – A push button connected to an I/O port with a pull-up resistor"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.4 – A push button connected to an I/O port with a pull-up resistor</p>
			<p>The resistor's value (<strong class="bold">R</strong>) in the <a id="_idIndexMarker199"/>preceding diagram is <a id="_idIndexMarker200"/>typically 10K ohms.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">You need to connect either a pull-down or pull-up resistor to a microcontroller's input port, because if you don't connect anything to the port (this can happen when the push button is not being pressed), the port will present an undetermined (random) voltage at its input due to its internal electronics arrangement. This <a id="_idIndexMarker201"/>is called a <strong class="bold">floating</strong> input voltage. </p>
			<p>The preceding diagram includes a normally open push button. Once the push button is pressed, the input voltage will change to a logical HIGH level, or 3.3 volts. Remember that the logical HIGH level can be 5 volts, depending on the microcontroller board that you are using. The <strong class="bold">Vcc</strong> voltage and the ground are connected to the microcontroller board.</p>
			<p>Fortunately, many microcontrollers provide internal pull-up and pull-down resistors that are connected to their I/O ports that can be activated via coding. The Blue Pill contains both! This means that we can connect a push button directly to its I/O ports, without connecting an external resistor, and just activate the board's internal pull-up or pull-down resistors via software. This speeds up prototyping development that requires the use of push buttons, but this may not always be the ideal solution.</p>
			<p>The following diagram shows two ways of connecting a push button directly to an I/O port. This port already has a pull-up or a pull-down resistor that's been activated via software:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16413_Figure_3.1_NEW.jpg" alt="Figure 3.5 – Push buttons connected directly to an I/O port"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.5 – Push buttons connected directly to an I/O port</p>
			<p>As you can see, the <a id="_idIndexMarker202"/>debouncing method via software does not <a id="_idIndexMarker203"/>use the RC debouncing that's connected to the push button. This method works most of the time, and it saves you time and effort. However, you should experiment and try out both methods if the electrical noise from the push button is persistent.</p>
			<p>Each debouncing method has its trade-offs. In the hardware-based method, you will need to connect some electronic components to the push button. You will also need to <em class="italic">buy</em> those extra components. In the software-based method, where you will be using the microcontroller's internal pull-up or pull-down resistors, you don't need to connect any extra components to the push button, but you will need to add more lines of code to your program to deal with the debouncing, and these instructions may take up some valuable processing cycles from your microcontroller. Despite this, we recommend that you use the software-based debouncing method because it is simple to implement.</p>
			<p>The next section deals with <a id="_idIndexMarker204"/>examples that show you how to <a id="_idIndexMarker205"/>connect a push button to the Blue Pill and Curiosity Nano microcontroller boards, as well as how to debounce it via software.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Connecting an LED to a microcontroller board port and using an internal pull-up resistor</h1>
			<p>In this section, you <a id="_idIndexMarker206"/>will learn how to connect a push button to <a id="_idIndexMarker207"/>both the Blue Pill and the Curiosity Nano boards. This is a simple exercise for these microcontroller boards, and it demonstrates <a id="_idIndexMarker208"/>how to use a push button to send a logical LOW level signal to a microcontroller board to turn an LED connected to it on or off. If we want to use a push button in our electronic circuit example, we will need to connect it to an input port from a microcontroller board. Also, remember that we should debounce our push button to avoid undesirable results.</p>
			<p>The following subsection will show you how to debounce a push button that is connected to the Blue Pill via coding. This is the simplest way to debounce a push button and you can use this method in other chapters of this book.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Debouncing a push button via software connected to the Blue Pill</h2>
			<p>In this section, we will show <a id="_idIndexMarker209"/>you a Fritzing diagram, and then a <a id="_idIndexMarker210"/>photo that shows how everything is connected. We will also look at some code that demonstrates how to debounce the push button via software.</p>
			<p>The following is a Fritzing diagram that shows how to connect a push button directly to an I/O port that is already using its internal pull-up resistor. The LED and its respective resistor are connected to the Blue Pill's port number; that is, <code>B12</code>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.6_B16413.jpg" alt="Figure 3.6 – A Blue Pill using its internal pull-up resistor with the push button"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.6 – A Blue Pill using its internal pull-up resistor with the push button</p>
			<p>As you can see, the LED will turn on or off every time <a id="_idIndexMarker211"/>we press the <a id="_idIndexMarker212"/>push button.</p>
			<p>Please note that in the preceding image, the push button is connected to the center of the breadboard, to the right of the microcontroller board. Follow these steps to connect the push button and the LED to the Blue Pill, as shown in the preceding image:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Insert the Blue Pill into the solderless breadboard.</li>
				<li>Insert the push button into the breadboard and connect one of its pins to the Blue Pill's ground pin using a DuPont wire.</li>
				<li>Connect another pin from the push button to port <code>B0</code> of the Blue Pill using a DuPont wire.</li>
				<li>Insert a 220-ohm resistor into the breadboard and connect one of its pins to port B12 of the Blue Pill using a DuPont wire.</li>
				<li>Insert the LED into the breadboard, connecting its anode to the other resistor's pin.</li>
				<li>Connect the LED's cathode to one of the ground pins of the Blue Pill using a DuPont wire.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The following image shows how to connect the push button to the Blue Pill, based on the Fritzing diagram shown previously:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.7_B16413.jpg" alt="Figure 3.7 – Connecting the push button to the Blue Pill's cathode, and then to one of the ground pins from the Blue Pill using a DuPont wire"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.7 – Connecting the push button to the Blue Pill's cathode, and then to one of the ground pins from the Blue Pill using a DuPont wire</p>
			<p>As you can see, the Blue Pill board <a id="_idIndexMarker213"/>has ground (<code>G</code>) pins on the top and bottom rows of pins. This facilitates the component <a id="_idIndexMarker214"/>connections in the circuit.</p>
			<p>Remember that you will need to connect the ST-Link/V2 electronic interface to the Blue Pill to upload the program to it from the Arduino IDE, as explained in <a href="B16413_01_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a><em class="italic">,</em> <em class="italic">Introduction to Microcontrollers and Microcontroller Boards</em>.</p>
			<p>The following code shows how to debounce a push button via software on the Blue Pill. You can find this code file in this book's GitHub repository, with comments provided. The file is called <code>internal_pullup_debounce_Blue_Pill.ino</code>:</p>
			<pre>#define PinLED PB12
#define Pinpushbutton PB0
void setup() {
  pinMode(PinLED, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(Pinpushbutton, INPUT_PULLUP);
}
int reading_pushbutton;
int ledState = HIGH;
int buttonState;
int lastButtonState = LOW;   
unsigned long lastDebouncingTime = 0; 
unsigned long debouncingDelay = 50;  
  
void loop() {
reading_pushbutton=digitalRead(Pinpushbutton);
if (reading_pushbutton!= lastButtonState) {
    lastDebouncingTime = millis();
}
if ((millis() - lastDebouncingTime) &gt; debouncingDelay) {
    if (reading_pushbutton!=buttonState) {
        buttonState = reading_pushbutton;
        if (buttonState == HIGH) {
            ledState = !ledState;
        }
    }
  }
digitalWrite(PinLED, ledState);
lastButtonState = reading_pushbutton;
}</pre>
			<p>The preceding code waits 50 milliseconds once the push button has been pressed and toggles the LED value. This value is experimental, so you may need to change it if your push button is working erratically.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The Blue Pill's I/O ports are <a id="_idIndexMarker215"/>referenced in the Arduino IDE with the letter P. For example, port B12 is referenced as <code>PB12</code> in the IDE. In addition, the port labels (names) must be written in capital letters.</p>
			<p>As shown in the preceding code, it <a id="_idIndexMarker216"/>continuously <a id="_idIndexMarker217"/>reads the port <code>B0</code> of the Blue Pill. If the push button is pressed, port <code>B0</code> is connected to ground by the push button. Then, the <code>B12</code> output port sends out a HIGH logical level and turns on the LED connected to <code>B12</code>. If the push button is not pressed, the <code>B12</code> port sends out a LOW logical level.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">You can also debounce a push button via software if you are using an Arduino microcontroller board. In fact, the software-based debouncing method we used in this chapter is based on the method that's used in Arduino boards, as explained here: </p>
			<p class="callout"><a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/Debounce">https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/Debounce</a></p>
			<p>If your LED turns on and off when you press the push button, congratulations! Pay attention to how the microcontroller board reacts when you press the push button. If the LED turns on erratically several times when you just press the push button, you may need to change either the resistor or capacitor values if you are doing RC debouncing, or change the millisecond waiting value if <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/>you are <a id="_idIndexMarker219"/>debouncing the push button via software.</p>
			<p>The next section describes how to debounce a push button via software connected to the Curiosity Nano microcontroller board.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Turning an LED on or off with a push button on the Curiosity Nano</h2>
			<p>In this section, we use the <a id="_idIndexMarker220"/>Curiosity Nano to debounce a push button via software by waiting some milliseconds once the <a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>push button has been pressed. We can use the <code>__delay_ms()</code> function for this. Remember that the function is written with two underscore symbols (<code>__</code>).</p>
			<p>The following Fritzing diagram shows how to connect the push button to the Curiosity Nano:</p>

			<p>Please note that the push button is connected to the center of the breadboard, to the right of the microcontroller board.</p>
			<p>According to the preceding image, here are the steps for connecting all the components:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Insert the Curiosity Nano into the solderless breadboard.</li>
				<li>Insert a push button into the breadboard and connect one of its pins to the Curiosity Nano's ground pin using a DuPont wire.</li>

				<li>Insert a 220-ohm resistor into the breadboard and connect one of its pins to the port <code>RD2</code> of the Curiosity Nano using a DuPont wire.</li>
				<li>Insert the LED into the breadboard, connecting its anode to the other resistor's pin. </li>
				<li>Connect the LED's cathode to one of the ground pins of the Curiosity Nano using a DuPont wire.</li>

			<p>In the preceding image, you can see that the Curiosity Nano has ground (<code>GND</code>) pins in both the upper and lower rows of pins. This allows us to wire the components in the circuit.</p>

			<p>The preceding code reads the value from the push button and waits 100 milliseconds; then, it reads it again to see if the push button is still being pressed. We found this 100-millisecond value experimentally and it seems to work most of the time. Remember that you may need to adjust it, depending on how your own push button behaves in your circuit.</p>
			<p>This is a slightly different <a id="_idIndexMarker226"/>approach than the one we used in the Blue Pill. We coded the waiting time to try and ignore some <a id="_idIndexMarker227"/>electrical noise that may occur during that time. If your LED turns on and off when you press the push button, congratulations! You are now able to connect and use a push button in an electronic circuit connected to a microcontroller board. Remember that a push button may be used to initiate a process or activity in a microcontroller board.</p>
			<p>The next section will show you how to check if a push button is working OK, and if it is a normally open or normally closed push button.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Testing out the push button</h1>
			<p>In this section, we will focus on <a id="_idIndexMarker228"/>testing a push button. Before using it with a microcontroller board, it's a good idea to try it out to see if it works mechanically, and testing allows us to find out if the push button is normally closed or normally opened. The following image shows how to connect all the components to try out the push button:</p>

			<p>As you can see, we <a id="_idIndexMarker229"/>don't need to connect a push button to a microcontroller board to test it. Here are the steps for connecting the components and testing the push button:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Connect the batteries' positive <strong class="bold">(+)</strong> terminal to one pin of the push button.</li>
				<li>Connect the other push button pin to the 220-ohm resistor.</li>
				<li>Connect the 220-ohm resistor to the LED's anode pin.</li>
				<li>Connect the LED's cathode pin to the batteries' negative <strong class="bold">(-)</strong> terminal. Be careful when connecting the LED's pins. If it is connected in reverse, the LED will not turn on.</li>
				<li>Once you've connected everything, if the LED turns on without you pressing the push button, this means that the push button is of the normally closed type. If it does, the LED should turn off when you press the push button. If the LED turns on every time you press the push button, this means that it is a normally open one.</li>
				<li>Press the push button several times. If the LED turns on and off erratically, or if the LED does not turn on at all, the push button may be faulty and you will need to replace it, assuming that the batteries have enough voltage.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Connecting the batteries to the <a id="_idIndexMarker230"/>push button and the LED should be enough to see if the push button works.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we learned what a push button is and how can we reduce the problem of electrical noise that many push buttons have, a process called debouncing. This process can be done either via software or hardware. We also reviewed the importance of push buttons in some electronic projects that require human intervention – for example, how to manually restart a microcontroller board when we press its on-board push button. Using a push button in an electronic circuit containing a microcontroller board is important because you are programming a user interaction there, so a user can start a process in the microcontroller board.</p>
			<p>The next chapter will focus on how to connect a photoresistor (a sensor that measures the amount of light in the environment).</p>
