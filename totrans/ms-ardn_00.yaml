- en: '**Mastering Arduino** is an all-in-one guide to getting the most out of your
    Arduino. This practical, no-nonsense guide teaches you all of the electronics
    and programming skills that you need, to create advanced Arduino projects. This
    book is packed full of real-world projects for you to practice on, bringing all
    of the knowledge in the book together and giving you the skills to build your
    own robot from the examples in this book. The final two chapters discuss wireless
    technologies and how they can be used in your projects.'

- en: The book begins with the basics of electronics, making sure that you understand
    components, circuits, and prototyping before moving on. It then performs the same
    function for code, getting you into the Arduino IDE and showing you how to connect
    the Arduino to a computer and run simple projects on your Arduino.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the basics are out of the way, the next 10 chapters of the book focus on
    small projects centered around particular components, such as LCD displays, stepper
    motors, or voice synthesizers. Each of these chapters will get you familiar with
    the technology involved, how to build with it, how to program it, and how it can
    be used in your own projects.
