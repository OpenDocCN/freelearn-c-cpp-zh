- en: LLVM is the state-of-the-art compiler optimization and code generation framework
    adopted by many amazing industrial and academic projects, such as the **Just-In-Time**
    (**JIT**) compiler in JavaScript engines and **machine learning** (**ML**) frameworks.
    It is a useful toolbox for building programming languages and binary file tools.
    However, despite the project's robustness, its learning resources are scattered,
    and it doesn't have the best documentation either. Due to this, it has a pretty
    steep learning curve, even for developers with some LLVM experience. This book
    aims to tackle these issues by providing you with knowledge of common and important
    domains in LLVM in a pragmatic fashion – showing you some useful engineering tips,
    pointing out lesser-known but handy features, and illustrating useful examples.

- en: As an **LLVM** developer, building LLVM from source has always been the first
    thing you should do. Given the scale of LLVM nowadays, this task can take hours
    to finish. Even worse, rebuilding the project to reflect changes might also take
    a long time and hinder your productivity. Therefore, it's crucial to know how
    to use the right tools and how to find the best build configurations for your
    project for the sake of saving various resources, especially your precious time.

    for large projects such as LLVM. This is because, unlike the compiling phase,
    it''s pretty hard for the linking phase to do file-level parallelization. Not
    to mention the fact that the BFD linker''s peak memory consumption when building
    LLVM usually takes about 20 GB, causing a burden on computers with small amounts
    of memory. Fortunately, there are at least two linkers in the wild that provide

    condensed into one place, thus avoiding unnecessary duplicates being created and
    saving lots of disk space. In addition, since debug info is not part of the object
    files anymore, the linker no longer needs to load them into memory and thus saves
    lots of memory resources. Last but not least, this feature can also improve our
