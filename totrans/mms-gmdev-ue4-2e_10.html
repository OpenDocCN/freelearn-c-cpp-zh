<p>Getting your game successfully out to an audience is quite possibly the most underrated and absolutely necessary skill in being a user of UE4. In this chapter, we will explore a couple of those avenues. Every team and every project will need to explore their respective platforms, but the process is fairly similar across each, with their own specifics of course. For some it's definitely more complicated to get to an audience than others, but hopefully by the end of this chapter you will have a good idea of the expectations to bring a product to just about any market. In this chapter we'll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Packaging the game for the PC</li>
<li>Android and iOS setup</li>
<li>When and how to make standalone installed versions of the game</li>
<li>Build and run on Android and iOS</li>
<li>Compare UE4's play vs. package builds</li>
<li>Tips to avoid downtime to builds</li>
</ul>

<p>Specific examples and references will be made with, and tested in, the Chapter 10 GitHub branch, but as usual, the principles and processes described can be applied to any project. Additionally, the game will be built for and tested on at least two devices: Windows and Visual Studio installed to a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 for Android, and macOS and Xcode used to build and install on an iPad Mini 3 for iOS. While neither of these setups or platforms is required for the lessons here, hopefully they provide valuable insight and information for those who do need it. And lastly, for any number of freely-available browsers (Chrome primarily here on both Mac and PC), an HTML5 build will be created and deployed: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Game-Development-with-Unreal-Engine-4-Second-Edition/tree/Chapter-10">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Game-Development-with-Unreal-Engine-4-Second-Edition/tree/Chapter-10</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, packaging a game is very different on every platform you can put it on. Building, submitting, and launching a game for iOS is a wholly different experience and process from PS4 or PC ,say, via Steam. Obviously the first question to ask is, "What is our audience, and which platforms will we deliver on?" The great part about UE4 is that of any platform you are likely to put out a game, it has a path and it can make a build that runs on that platform. We'll go through a few examples here, though Xbox and PS4 are different creatures as they require more direct involvement of their hosts (Microsoft and Sony, respectively), whereas the platforms here tend to be a little less restrictive.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">It's always good to partner up with someone who has experience in the final stages of setting up a project for deployment from a platform. For example, Microsoft has for Xbox and other areas Developer Account Managers (DAMs) who partner up with medium- and large-sized projects, and this is generally left to a studio's production team to establish contacts and facilitate communication with the development team. That said, for independent developers, this may sound obvious, but partner up if you can with other indie devs who have had success on your platform. The communities in these areas are generally quite inclusive and supportive. Everybody needs a little help sometimes, and contributing to, and being a part of, such relationships is another underrepresented advantage to successful game development.</div>

            <article>
                
<p>Probably the easiest platform for UE4 to package on is the PC (or Mac): you're already running on one, and most likely the work you've done and tested in PIE will just "work" on PC when you package a build. That said, we'll explore what it takes to prepare to make a version for the most popular mobile platforms of Android (an installable <kbd>.APK</kbd>) and iOS (a similar <kbd>.IPA</kbd>. Note that for the latter (iOS), to actually build and properly test, <em>unless making a blueprint only game, </em>requires an Apple developer license, which as of this writing costs about $99 for a one-year subscription. If this is one of your target platforms, it's usually best to just get that license as early as possible; but for hobbyists and indie developers on a budget, please do note that deploying and testing on Android and HTML5 with the project presented here works just fine and is free.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">For specific platform users, please note that a Windows 10 PC and Visual Studio were used to build, test, and deploy Android (which won't work from a Mac), and to build, test, and deploy iOS, a MacBook Pro with Xcode was used (and won't work on a PC without a Mac of some sort, as code changes have been made to our project). It is possible to build iOS builds from a PC with a Mac in the network; but this was often found to be problematic both in a professional mid-sized studio and team, and in home development for this book. If it works easily and reliably for you, congratulations, but the steps to set that up will only be presented in the <em>Further reading</em> section.</div>
<p>Before diving into an Android build, here are some general notes for in this case, both mobile platforms discussed here. First, for those curious, the next section will specifically address some of the differences between using the Play button in the editor on a device/platform combination compared to the packaging discussed in the rest of this section, so if that seems missing at this stage, just be patient. Here are some general settings for our project for cooking and packaging all platforms should simply have set, let's look at here under <span class="packt_screen">Project/Packaging</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/7bb061c5-e14b-41db-b056-4bf4970e34e2.png" style="width:52.92em;height:37.42em;"/></p>
<p>Since FrozenCove, for example, is only referenced "lightly" by name in the level-transition volume of our default map. We add it (and similarly MasteringTestMap) to the always-included list above:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f60868ec-bb49-459d-9e0f-7847c8450d77.png"/></p>
<p>Additionally, since she can be spawned potentially dynamically without a hard reference, we cook in the Countess's Meshes folder (really it's just as an example of what you may need to do when you have assets you may load and use that aren't hard-referenced in maps directly). If you browse around under each platform's options in the platform section of project settings, you'll notice they all have splash-screen textures you can set, and many have resolution or orientation options that your team can (and should) set as appropriate.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Those things handled, we move on to building on for Android. First, go to your engine install's <kbd>/Extras/AndroidWorks/Win64</kbd> folder and launch the executable there. This will automatically take you through what's needed to successfully build a UE4 Android project, and the basic integration for Visual Studio. There are several differences between doing local Android builds and release-to-public Android builds regarding store keys (or an upload key, which I recommend), and what's helpful to avoid me simply copying all these URLs into Further Reading is that Epic integrates links directly to the information you need in the project settings for the Android platform, see here:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/fa1bb9cc-69ce-4e86-b416-d6ebf920d562.png" style="width:47.08em;height:33.17em;"/></p>
<p>Those blue links should take you to up-to-date Android pages on those topics. There, you can read all about the various methods for singing and submitting your build to the Google Play store, and a link to signing up for a Key Store. As that process is then specific to a given project and the team's choices (the links give good background I don't need to repeat here), here are just a couple of quick general notes that will lead into the more technical next topic: for those who don't know already, in the Play store, you can restrict your title by excluding certain types of hardware, specific phones, or devices, restrict it showing up only to users with a certain Android version (which should match the one you set here in Epic's project settings!), and have a great deal of options on their end for what specifics your game is presented to, or restricted from. Typically, a project manager or other team member dedicated to this will set up those specifics on the Play web interface for your project, but from a technical standpoint, it is critical to know what those options mean, and how they are compatible with the builds you're generating and uploading. Here is a specific example that was obvious to see:</p>
<p>One of the most basic loadouts for Android is building with open GL ES2, and ETC2 compression, the former in Project Settings (more on that in a moment), the latter selected here, with one of those choices being a multi-config you can tune:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b320ab52-ebbc-4996-bfe6-9a33c6d59e93.png"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Now, ETC2 is a very widely-distributed and supported texture-compression for Android, and ES2 is a base-level Open GL ES version on a huge swath of older phones and tablets. If built with these two settings, the build will fail when trying to compile shaders. If you simply change to a newer compression routine, ASTC, you'll notice things build, but the Countess shows up with the grey-checkered default texture. Her material will not fail the build in ASTC, but it also is not rendered correctly in ES2. The problem is easy to track down if you go check on one of those materials:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/26f83a74-6aea-4dd9-a72a-d59001019f62.png"/></p>
<p>ES2 is no good here, the most obvious solution is to change to ES3.1 for our Android builds, as it recommends:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/ffa67a27-8f84-4afd-9c67-b80eb2b3ed0a.png"/></p>
<p>And in this case, our build builds and packages successfully and the Countess looks great on the Galaxy Note 8 used here (but that's a high-end phone as of this writing and rather expensive). So what happens if your team wants the game to run on older devices? Well, that's where the quality switch referenced in <a href="e80319fb-a34f-4648-9d86-0830791ac4d4.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Shader Editing and Optimization</em> <em>Tips</em> comes in:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b10d76e3-7bfb-477e-b948-c3861c12b403.png"/></p>
<p>If you double-click that node (<span class="packt_screen">MF_CharacterEffects</span>), you'll notice we're skipping only one specific aspect of the material (death fade); but that's often the case, if you make one project that needs to work across a large array of devices and capabilities. <span>ES2 builds just skip the problematic feature entirely, and now ETC2/ES2 builds are successful and run fine, though this did of course require saving several materials affected and rebuilding a ton of shaders, yet again, so beware of these kinds of risks! Note also, it's perfectly acceptable, and quite common, to have separate "SKUs" (think product model) of a game that can be delivered to different sets of hardware. A game doesn't have to be made to be tolerant of all possible hardware combinations it may be installed to, but it's desirable if you can, especially for multiplayer games. If maintaining this tolerance of high- and low-end potential platforms becomes unreasonable, set up one SKU for high-end, set up another for low-end, and just be ready to double-up (or otherwise multiply) your builds, and their testing time, every time you need to release updates.</span></p>
<p>One last thing, you'll notice that Android has an option to package assets into <kbd>.apk</kbd> <span>–</span> for a very small project this might be ok, but for most projects (including even this small one) it's advisable not to use this. This will generate an .obb file for the project, which the Play store knows how to handle downloading and installing, and makes life much simpler especially if small <kbd>.apk</kbd> changes are needed (such as bug fixes) with no asset changes to the project. People can test and run, and you can submit builds much faster if you're not including hundreds of MB or 1+ GB of assets in every build and just working with a typical dozen-MB-sized <kbd>.apk</kbd>.</p>

<p>Similar to Android's Play Store Key, Apple has a rather arcane, but well-defined, process of generating keys and signing its .ipa packages to deploy to your iOS devices for testing. In the end, what you're using should look something like this with nice "<span class="packt_screen">Valid</span>" sections everywhere, for both a development signing Provisioning Profile, and Certificate, as well as various Ad-hoc or other production profile/certificate combinations:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/6a93c848-8b68-4404-b7d3-baef66bd5843.png" style="width:46.00em;height:32.58em;"/></p>
<p>Links for all of Apple's steps for this are listed here, since Epic does not link them directly as it does for Android. Note, you'll need a valid Developer Account with Apple for most of these links.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, you will need an AppID, make sure that <em>if</em> you use something such as "com.mastering.*" that in your project settings you don't set it to "com.mastering" or this will not be found, it needs to be "com.mastering.dev" or something for the provisioning profile to match your certificate (more on that from Apple in a moment): <a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifier/bundle">https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifier/bundle</a></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Set up at least one device (such as test iPads or iPhones):<span> </span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/device/ipad">https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/device/ipad</a></li>
<li>You will need to get familiar with making a development (you only get one of these) and Ad-hoc/Store distribution certificates. It's recommended to get started with the development certificate if this is your first time going through the process with an Apple build:<span> </span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/certificate/create">https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/certificate/create</a></li>
<li>And then similarly, you'll want to get accustomed to making Provisioning Profiles <span>–</span> both a single development one for your team typically, and then one or more for Ad-hoc/Store distribution again: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/profile/">https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/profile/</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Download these from the links by clicking on them, and import them into UE4. Hopefully all goes well, but for what it's worth, in years of development, I have never seen someone go through this process and have it succeed on the first try. Fortunately, there are thousands of others out there who have probably hit the same snags you will, and after a bit of searching, solutions can typically be found online for whatever issues stop you from having a smooth, successful setup here.</p>

<p>This section should move us rather quickly through proper device testing on our mobile (or HTML5 and PC) platforms now that all the setup is taken care of. As noted in the <em>iOS</em> section, don't get frustrated if things don't immediately work correctly, every team has pains getting these things setup and working properly initially, but once they are, it's typically a much smoother process to simply maintain and modify those build settings and processes going forward. So let's get to it!</p>

<p>OK, one last interruption before we actually make a few builds and test those on their intended platforms: you may be wondering, "What's the difference between just using the Play button in the editor and having it do all the work getting it onto my device compared to this packaging business?" Well in a very rough, very quick nutshell: the Play button will build, cook, and deploy to a platform and does a good job of it, which is very helpful for rapid testing. However, it may put files in a different place than your standalone build does when installed, and uses some specific settings. For example, needing to be able to "attach" to the game from an external debugger for iOS on a Mac. You typically <em>must</em> use a developer certificate/provisioning profile in your settings when using the Play button, and specifically don't/can't have that Entitlement setting on a product you upload to Apple to deploy to an audience. So once again, apply common sense here: if you are just making quick changes and want a simple test on the hardware, if the Play button is working for your project and platform, feel free to use it. When you're expecting to actually deliver to a store to deploy, make standalone builds and test with those.</p>

<p>When your team feels they need to start testing on various platforms is really dependent on your entire development philosophy and process. Most major studios already have these processes in place, and have specific milestone gates to pass, some of which will likely specifically require standalone builds on the platform(s) the game will be run on, other stages may require a simple demonstration of gameplay and art assets, which do not require this. Many independent developers will want to simply have the shortest iteration time possible for getting basic concepts proven out (much like this book had done up to this section), which is by far the most streamlined for simply testing in the editor in PIE on a PC or Mac. However, if you're reading this section at all, it means you have a need and interest in eventually running on devices, and the best advice here is, if at all possible, have those builds working from day one of development, and build, deploy, and test regularly. This is another aspect of development often left neglected, or dormant, for too long, and then when needed most and used, causes unforeseen problems. It's definitely easier to develop day to day without taking the time to make standalone builds (or even use the Play button); but the longer a team goes without doing these, the greater the risk that when they do, there's a problem, and those problems are typically ones that prevent release entirely. So build, deploy, and test as often as possible!</p>

<p><span>Windows: As there is really nothing to it, building a PC package is as simple as </span><span class="packt_screen">File -&gt; Package Project</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Windows</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Win32</span><span> (or </span><span class="packt_screen">Win64</span><span>) and similar for Mac builds. This gives you an executable and your built assets in folders, and at this stage, uploading to a product, such as Steam, for delivery should be very simple. Given this, we won't really spend any time on it; but if you simply want to test the building process, this is the fastest, easiest, simplest way to do so. If you check under <span class="packt_screen">Project Settings</span></span> | <span><span class="packt_screen">Platforms</span></span> | <span><span class="packt_screen">Windows</span>, you'll also notice very few options, so without further ado, we'll move on to packaging Android and iOS.</span></p>
<p>Android: Selecting your preferred texture-compression type under <span><span class="packt_screen">File | Package Project | Android</span> (see the picture of the dropdown in the <span class="packt_screen">Setup</span> section) will generate an .apk file, by default an .obb file, and two .bat files to the folder specified when you clicked to start that build. The <kbd>.bat</kbd> files are very clearly labeled: one for uninstalling the project, the other for installing it (note that the latter will perform the former to make sure you get a clean install of a project with the same AppID each time). Assuming you got your device set up for debugging as </span><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device">https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device </a>and can test that it is being seen in a command-line use of "adb devices," then that .bat file will automatically install directly to that device (if you have only one device present, which is typically the case).</p>
<p>iOS: Selecting <span class="packt_screen">File</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Package Project | iOS</span> will generate a .ipa file for you in the folder you specified. Typically, this is then simply added to your device in XCode's Devices window with the <span class="packt_screen">+</span> button in the <span class="packt_screen">Devices and Simulators</span> window.</p>
<p>HTML5 will bundle up all the JavaScript and everything else it uses into a package that can be dragged into a browser to launch it. How you deliver this to users is up to you from a web-distribution standpoint, and not explored here further.</p>
<p>Once these builds are on the device, they can be run as any other more traditionally installed by download from their respective store. Thankfully, both Apple and Google give staging areas to do test runs of uploaded builds, also, so the whole pipeline for those platforms can be tested fully before then being sent for live submission/approval.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>One final note is simply a reminder to use common sense when considering how to test. Are your changes ones that might affect graphics on different platforms (material edits, complex new shader changes, or making changes to project settings that might affect such features)? Then test them on a representative device. Are your changes solely gameplay (note that things such as using the filesystem can be problematic on different platforms, and at this stage of the GitHub project, there is definitely a bug in load/save on devices I can hopefully address soon, for example)? It's typically best to iterate these quickly on your development platform; but when ultimately done, especially at least overnight, build for your actual platform and make sure there are no surprises. On a large project, spending an hour to cook assets every time you want to test any small change is foolish, but neglecting your actual intended hardware platforms is too.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that there are some very good tools and techniques out there for automating a lot of these process and centralizing builds and deployment on a single high-powered machine that can then be readily accessed and used by the whole team any time. For example, see Jenkins and HockeyApp in the <em>Further reading</em> section. For a build-automation platform such as Jenkins, setup can often be as simple as watching the Output Window as you package via the Unreal Editor, and copying each of the execution lines it uses into steps there. If you have a large project, large team, or large number of target platforms, this type of automation is highly recommended.</p>
