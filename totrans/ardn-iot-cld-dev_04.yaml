    have significant negative effects on our health and well-being. Poor air quality
    can cause a variety of respiratory and cardiovascular problems, such as asthma,
    chronic bronchitis, lung cancer, and heart disease. It can also exacerbate existing
    health conditions and reduce our ability to fight off infections and illnesses.

    humidity, and air quality. However, our primary goal is to provide sensors that
    are affordable and readily available to users worldwide. For temperature and humidity
    measurements, we rely on the widely available and reasonably priced DHT11/DHT22
    sensors. The MQ-135 sensor provides a wide detecting scope, fast response, and
    high sensitivity. It is a stable and long-life, simple drive circuit application.
    These sensors are used in air quality control equipment and are suitable for detecting
    NH3, NOx, alcohol, benzene, smoke, CO2, and more. They are easily obtainable on
    the market and well-suited for small-scale projects.

    but we will use two new variable types for humidity (`CloudRelativeHumidity`)
    and temperature (`CloudTemperatureSensor`), which measure data in percentage and
    Celsius, respectively. Next, make sure to declare the variables exactly as stated
    in the given table, including case-sensitive names and variable types. If the
    example code does not match your naming, you will need to modify it accordingly.

    modification. That’s why read-only mode is used to prevent issues in data consistency.
    **Update policy** is set to **On change**, as the device will send the data after
    five minutes, and this option is more appropriate compared to periodic updates.

- en: In this chapter, we explored how to develop a low-cost air quality monitoring
    system using DHT11, MQ-135, and the WeMos D1 Mini development board. We set up
    the Thing, which involved creating cloud variables, associating the device, configuring
    the network, and coding the development board. Later, we created a dashboard to
    visualize the Thing’s sensor readings with different types of widgets, displaying
    the current readings as well as historical data with the help of graphs. Through
    this project, you will get the confidence to set up the Thing practically and
    deploy it in the field using a PCB. You have learned about new types of cloud
    variables for sensor readings and storage, as well as dealing with different types
    of dashboard widgets.
