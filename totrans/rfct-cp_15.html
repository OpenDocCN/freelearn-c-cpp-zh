<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">In the preceding chapters of this book, we have systematically explored a range of automated solutions designed to enhance the quality of our C++ code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">These include the adoption of clear naming conventions, the utilization of modern C++ features, the rigorous implementation of unit and end-to-end testing, the maintenance of clean commits and messages, and the effective use of debugging techniques such as git bisect, among others. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">Each of these practices serves as a vital component in our toolkit for writing robust, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">maintainable software.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">However, despite the substantial benefits conferred by these automated tools and methodologies, they are not infallible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">They rely on correct and consistent implementation, and without diligent oversight, it’s all too easy for standards to slip and errors to creep into our codebase. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">This is where the critical role of code review comes into play. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.4">A human eye, capable of interpreting context and nuance, is essential in ensuring that all these automated practices are correctly and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">effectively applied.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">In this chapter, we will delve deep into the practice of code review, an indispensable part of the development process that helps safeguard against the oversights that no machine can yet fully detect. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">We’ll discuss how code reviews not only prevent potential bugs and enhance code quality but also foster a collaborative culture of learning and accountability among developers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3">Through a comprehensive exploration of effective strategies and practical guidelines, we aim to equip you with the knowledge to implement robust code reviews that significantly contribute to the success and reliability of your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">C++ projects.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-312"><a id="_idTextAnchor311"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">What is a code review and why is it needed?</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">The practice</span><a id="_idIndexMarker860"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1"> of code review, as we understand it today, owes its origins to Michael Fagan, who developed the formal process of software inspection in the mid-1970s. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">At that</span><a id="_idIndexMarker861"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1"> time, software engineering was often a solitary pursuit, with individual developers acting as lone cowboys who were responsible for writing, testing, and reviewing their own code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">This method led to inconsistent standards across projects and a higher incidence of overlooked errors, as individual biases and blind spots </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">went unchecked.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Recognizing the limitations of this solitary approach, Fagan introduced a structured method to inspect software systematically. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">His process was aimed not only at finding errors but also at</span><a id="_idIndexMarker862"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1"> examining the overall design and implementation of software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">This shift marked a significant evolution in software development, emphasizing collaboration, meticulous examination, and shared responsibility. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.3">By involving multiple reviewers, Fagan’s method brought diverse perspectives to the evaluation process, enhancing the scrutiny and overall quality of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">the software.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-313"><a id="_idTextAnchor312"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">Benefits of code reviews</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">Code reviews </span><a id="_idIndexMarker863"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">significantly enhance the overall quality of code by ensuring that the software’s design is consistent with the project’s architectural standards and the best practices of C++. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">These reviews are crucial for enforcing coding standards and conventions, thereby fostering a codebase that is more uniform and easier to comprehend for both new and existing team members. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.3">Moreover, they aid in maintaining high levels of understandability by facilitating discussions about complex sections of the code and clarifying the rationale behind specific approaches. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.4">For instance, consider a scenario where a developer employs unconventional loop structures that, although functional, are challenging to understand and maintain. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.5">During a code review, these issues can be brought to light, and a suggestion to refactor the code using standard STL algorithms might be made. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.6">This not only simplifies the code but also ensures alignment with modern C++ practices, enhancing readability </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">and maintainability.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">Peer reviews are one of the most effective ways to catch bugs early before they make it into production. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">It is always better to have another pair of eyes on the code to look for errors, whether they are logical mistakes or incorrect usage of the language. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.3">Reviewers can identify logic errors, off-by-one errors, memory leaks, and other common C++ pitfalls that might not be immediately apparent to the original author. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.4">Moreover, conducting a thorough review of test cases in unit tests during the code review process is equally vital. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.5">This practice ensures that the tests cover sufficient scenarios and catch potential bugs at an early stage, thereby enhancing the reliability and robustness of the software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.6">For example, a developer might forget to free the memory allocated during a function, potentially causing a memory leak. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.7">A peer reviewing this code might spot this oversight and suggest the use of smart pointers to automatically manage the memory lifecycle, effectively preventing such issues before the software progresses further in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">development cycle.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">Reviews </span><a id="_idIndexMarker864"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">are invaluable as an educational tool, benefiting both the authors and the reviewers by disseminating domain knowledge and enhancing familiarity with the codebase throughout the team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">This aspect of knowledge transfer is crucial in ensuring that all team members are aligned and capable of contributing effectively. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">For instance, a junior developer might initially use raw pointers to manage resources, which is a common practice yet prone to errors such as memory leaks and pointer-related bugs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.4">During a code review, a more experienced developer can guide the junior by introducing them to smart pointers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.5">By explaining the advantages of smart pointers, such as automatic memory management and improved safety, the senior developer not only helps correct immediate issues but also aids in the junior developer’s growth and understanding of modern C++ practices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.6">Additionally, code reviews offer a unique opportunity for reviewers to deepen their understanding of specific features within the project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.7">As they evaluate the work of their peers, reviewers gain insights into new functionalities and complex areas of the application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.8">This enhanced understanding equips them with the knowledge necessary to effectively address future bugs or implement enhancements in those specific areas. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.9">Essentially, through the process of reviewing others’ code, reviewers not only contribute to the immediate improvement of the project but also prepare themselves to maintain and expand on the project’s capabilities in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">the future.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">Mutual responsibility is a key benefit of conducting regular code reviews within a team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">As team members consistently examine each other’s work, they cultivate a strong sense of shared responsibility and accountability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.3">This collective oversight encourages every member to maintain high standards and thoroughness in their coding efforts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.4">For example, the awareness that their peers will scrutinize their code motivates developers to initially write cleaner and more efficient code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.5">This proactive approach to coding quality reduces the likelihood of future extensive rewrites, streamlining the development process and enhancing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">overall productivity.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">Code reviews frequently catalyze discussions that yield more efficient, elegant, or simpler solutions than those initially implemented. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">This aspect of code reviews is particularly valuable as it taps into the collective expertise and experience of the team to enhance the overall software design. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.3">For instance, consider a developer who implements a function to sort a vector inefficiently. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.4">During the code review, another team member might notice the inefficiency and suggest a more effective sorting algorithm or recommend leveraging existing utilities from the standard library. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.5">Such suggestions not only improve performance but also simplify the code, reducing complexity and potential for errors, thus making the software more robust </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">and maintainable.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-314"><a id="_idTextAnchor313"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">Preparing for code reviews</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">Before delving </span><a id="_idIndexMarker865"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">into the collaborative process of code reviews, teams must prepare adequately to ensure that these reviews are as effective and efficient as possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">This preparation not only sets the stage for a smoother review process but also minimizes the time spent on avoidable issues, allowing teams to focus on more substantive and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">impactful discussions.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-315"><a id="_idTextAnchor314"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">Clear guidelines</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">The foundation </span><a id="_idIndexMarker866"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">of an effective code review process is the establishment and documentation of clear, specific coding guidelines tailored to C++. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">These guidelines should cover various aspects of coding, including style, practices, and the use of language-specific features. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">By setting these standards, teams create a common language that reduces ambiguity and ensures consistency across </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">the codebase.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">Incorporating as much automation as possible into these guidelines can significantly streamline the review process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">Tools such as formatters ensure a consistent coding style, while static analysis tools can automatically detect potential errors or code smells before human reviewers ever look at the code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">Additionally, ensuring that all code submissions are accompanied by passing unit tests and, where applicable, end-to-end tests can prevent many common software defects from ever reaching the review stage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.4">This level of automation not only saves time for reviewers but also reduces the potential for disputes over subjective preferences in coding style or </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">minor oversights.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-316"><a id="_idTextAnchor315"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">Self-review</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">Another crucial aspect </span><a id="_idIndexMarker867"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">of preparing for code reviews is the practice of self-review. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">Before submitting their code for peer review, developers should thoroughly examine their own work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">This is where tools such as linters and static analysis come into play, helping to catch common issues that can be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">easily overlooked.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">Self-review encourages developers to take responsibility for their code’s initial quality, reducing the burden on peer reviewers and fostering a culture of accountability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">It also allows developers to reflect on their work and consider potential improvements before involving others, which can lead to higher-quality submissions and more productive review sessions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.3">A developer should methodically evaluate their work by asking the following questions before submitting their code for peer review. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.4">This reflective practice helps to refine the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker868"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">code, align it more closely with project goals, and prepare the developer for any subsequent discussions during the code </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">review process:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">When a dispute involves more than a couple of comments back and forth, it’s advisable to shift the conversation </span><a id="_idIndexMarker874"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">from written comments to a direct dialogue. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">This can be through a video call, phone call, or face-to-face meeting, depending on what’s feasible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.3">Direct communication can prevent the kind of miscommunication and escalation often seen in text-based discussions, which can quickly become unproductive and contentious, much like lengthy threads seen on platforms such </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">as Reddit.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-327"><a id="_idTextAnchor326"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">Involving additional perspectives</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">If a resolution cannot be reached between the reviewer and the reviewee, it can be beneficial to involve additional perspectives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.2">Bringing in a third engineer, a product manager, a QA specialist, or even an architect can provide new insights and help mediate the disagreement. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.3">These parties may offer alternative solutions, compromise approaches, or a decision based on broader project priorities and impacts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.4">Their input can be crucial in breaking deadlocks and ensuring that the decision is well rounded and aligns with overall </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">project goals.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">Efficient dispute resolution during code reviews is vital for keeping the review process constructive and focused on enhancing the quality of the codebase. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.2">By explaining the rationale behind feedback, encouraging direct communication, and involving additional perspectives when necessary, teams can resolve disagreements effectively and maintain a positive, collaborative environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.3">This approach not only resolves conflicts but also strengthens the team’s ability to work through future </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">challenges collaboratively.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">The role of a</span><a id="_idIndexMarker875"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1"> reviewer in the code review process is crucial not just for ensuring the technical quality of code but also for maintaining a constructive, respectful, and educational environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.2">The following are some key practices</span><a id="_idIndexMarker876"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1"> that define a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">good reviewer.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-329"><a id="_idTextAnchor328"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">Initiate the conversation</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">Start the review process by initiating a friendly conversation with the reviewee. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.2">This can be a brief message acknowledging the effort they have put into the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">pull request</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">PR</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">) and setting a positive tone for the upcoming review. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.2">A cordial start helps to build rapport with the reviewee, making the subsequent exchange more open </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">and collaborative.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-330"><a id="_idTextAnchor329"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">Maintain politeness and respect</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">Always be polite and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker877"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">respectful in your comments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.2">Remember that the reviewee has invested significant effort into their code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.3">Critiques should be constructive, focusing on the code and its improvement rather than on the individual. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.4">Phrasing feedback in the form of questions or suggestions rather than directives can also help to keep the tone positive </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">and encouraging.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-331"><a id="_idTextAnchor330"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">Review manageable chunks</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">Limit the amount of code you review at one time to about 400 lines, if possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.2">Reviewing large chunks</span><a id="_idIndexMarker878"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1"> of code can lead to fatigue, which increases the likelihood of missing both minor and critical issues. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.2">Breaking down reviews into manageable parts not only enhances the effectiveness of the review process but also helps to maintain a high level of attention </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">to detail.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">While the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker879"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1"> second version is a bit more concise, the first version is equally valid and adheres to the project’s coding standards. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">If you feel strongly about a personal preference that could enhance the code, clearly label it as such. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.3">Indicate that it is a suggestion based on personal preference and not a mandatory change. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.4">This clarity helps the reviewee understand which changes are essential for compliance with project standards and which are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">optional enhancements.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-333"><a id="_idTextAnchor332"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">Focus on understandability</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">One of the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker880"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">most critical questions to ask yourself as a reviewer is whether the code is understandable enough that you, or someone else on the team, could fix it in the middle of the night. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.2">This question cuts to the heart of code maintainability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.3">If the answer is no, it’s important to discuss ways to improve the code’s clarity and simplicity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.4">Code that is easily understood is easier to maintain and debug, which is crucial for long-term </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">project health.</span></span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-334"><a id="_idTextAnchor333"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">Summary</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">This chapter delved into the essential practices and principles of conducting effective code reviews, a critical component of the software development process in C++. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.2">Through a series of structured sub-chapters, we have explored various aspects of the code review process that collectively ensure high-quality, maintainable code while fostering a positive </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">team environment.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">We began by discussing the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">origins of code reviews</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">, introduced in the 1970s by Michael Fagan, highlighting its transformational role in moving software development from an isolated task to a collaborative effort that enhances code quality and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">reduces bugs.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">In the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">Preparing for code reviews </span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">section, we emphasized the importance of clear guidelines and self-review. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.2">Developers are encouraged to use tools such as linters and static analyzers to refine their code before it undergoes peer review, ensuring adherence to coding standards and reducing the iterative cycle of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">code revisions.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">The </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">How to pass a code review</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1"> section outlined strategies for developers to ensure their code is well received during reviews. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">This includes discussing significant changes before coding, understanding code reviews as a constructive dialogue, and remembering to detach personal identity from the code to view </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">feedback objectively.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">The</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1"> How to efficiently dispute during a code review</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1"> section addressed handling disagreements productively. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.2">We discussed the importance of clear justifications for changes, using direct communication to avoid misinterpretations, and involving additional perspectives when necessary to resolve conflicts and reach </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">a consensus.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">Finally, in the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">How to be a good reviewer </span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">section, we provided guidance on initiating reviews with a positive interaction, reviewing code in manageable portions, avoiding bias from personal preferences, and assessing code for its clarity and ease of understanding in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">critical situations.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">Throughout this chapter, the underlying theme has been that code reviews are not just about critiquing code but about building a supportive community of developers who share knowledge, improve continuously, and aim for excellence in their coding practices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.2">The goal is to enhance both the technical quality of the software and the professional development of the team members involved. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.3">By adhering to these best practices, teams can achieve more robust, efficient, and error-free code, contributing significantly to the success of their </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">C++ projects.</span></span></p>
