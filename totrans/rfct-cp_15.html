<h1 id="_idParaDest-311"><a id="_idTextAnchor310"/>Code Review</h1>
<p>In the preceding chapters of this book, we have systematically explored a range of automated solutions designed to enhance the quality of our C++ code. These include the adoption of clear naming conventions, the utilization of modern C++ features, the rigorous implementation of unit and end-to-end testing, the maintenance of clean commits and messages, and the effective use of debugging techniques such as git bisect, among others. Each of these practices serves as a vital component in our toolkit for writing robust, maintainable software.</p>
<p>However, despite the substantial benefits conferred by these automated tools and methodologies, they are not infallible. They rely on correct and consistent implementation, and without diligent oversight, it’s all too easy for standards to slip and errors to creep into our codebase. This is where the critical role of code review comes into play. A human eye, capable of interpreting context and nuance, is essential in ensuring that all these automated practices are correctly and effectively applied.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will delve deep into the practice of code review, an indispensable part of the development process that helps safeguard against the oversights that no machine can yet fully detect. We’ll discuss how code reviews not only prevent potential bugs and enhance code quality but also foster a collaborative culture of learning and accountability among developers. Through a comprehensive exploration of effective strategies and practical guidelines, we aim to equip you with the knowledge to implement robust code reviews that significantly contribute to the success and reliability of your C++ projects.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-312"><a id="_idTextAnchor311"/>What is a code review and why is it needed?</h1>
<p>The practice<a id="_idIndexMarker860"/> of code review, as we understand it today, owes its origins to Michael Fagan, who developed the formal process of software inspection in the mid-1970s. At that<a id="_idIndexMarker861"/> time, software engineering was often a solitary pursuit, with individual developers acting as lone cowboys who were responsible for writing, testing, and reviewing their own code. This method led to inconsistent standards across projects and a higher incidence of overlooked errors, as individual biases and blind spots went unchecked.</p>
<p>Recognizing the limitations of this solitary approach, Fagan introduced a structured method to inspect software systematically. His process was aimed not only at finding errors but also at<a id="_idIndexMarker862"/> examining the overall design and implementation of software. This shift marked a significant evolution in software development, emphasizing collaboration, meticulous examination, and shared responsibility. By involving multiple reviewers, Fagan’s method brought diverse perspectives to the evaluation process, enhancing the scrutiny and overall quality of the software.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-313"><a id="_idTextAnchor312"/>Benefits of code reviews</h1>
<p>Code reviews <a id="_idIndexMarker863"/>significantly enhance the overall quality of code by ensuring that the software’s design is consistent with the project’s architectural standards and the best practices of C++. These reviews are crucial for enforcing coding standards and conventions, thereby fostering a codebase that is more uniform and easier to comprehend for both new and existing team members. Moreover, they aid in maintaining high levels of understandability by facilitating discussions about complex sections of the code and clarifying the rationale behind specific approaches. For instance, consider a scenario where a developer employs unconventional loop structures that, although functional, are challenging to understand and maintain. During a code review, these issues can be brought to light, and a suggestion to refactor the code using standard STL algorithms might be made. This not only simplifies the code but also ensures alignment with modern C++ practices, enhancing readability and maintainability.</p>
<p>Peer reviews are one of the most effective ways to catch bugs early before they make it into production. It is always better to have another pair of eyes on the code to look for errors, whether they are logical mistakes or incorrect usage of the language. Reviewers can identify logic errors, off-by-one errors, memory leaks, and other common C++ pitfalls that might not be immediately apparent to the original author. Moreover, conducting a thorough review of test cases in unit tests during the code review process is equally vital. This practice ensures that the tests cover sufficient scenarios and catch potential bugs at an early stage, thereby enhancing the reliability and robustness of the software. For example, a developer might forget to free the memory allocated during a function, potentially causing a memory leak. A peer reviewing this code might spot this oversight and suggest the use of smart pointers to automatically manage the memory lifecycle, effectively preventing such issues before the software progresses further in the development cycle.</p>
<p>Reviews <a id="_idIndexMarker864"/>are invaluable as an educational tool, benefiting both the authors and the reviewers by disseminating domain knowledge and enhancing familiarity with the codebase throughout the team. This aspect of knowledge transfer is crucial in ensuring that all team members are aligned and capable of contributing effectively. For instance, a junior developer might initially use raw pointers to manage resources, which is a common practice yet prone to errors such as memory leaks and pointer-related bugs. During a code review, a more experienced developer can guide the junior by introducing them to smart pointers. By explaining the advantages of smart pointers, such as automatic memory management and improved safety, the senior developer not only helps correct immediate issues but also aids in the junior developer’s growth and understanding of modern C++ practices. Additionally, code reviews offer a unique opportunity for reviewers to deepen their understanding of specific features within the project. As they evaluate the work of their peers, reviewers gain insights into new functionalities and complex areas of the application. This enhanced understanding equips them with the knowledge necessary to effectively address future bugs or implement enhancements in those specific areas. Essentially, through the process of reviewing others’ code, reviewers not only contribute to the immediate improvement of the project but also prepare themselves to maintain and expand on the project’s capabilities in the future.</p>
<p>Mutual responsibility is a key benefit of conducting regular code reviews within a team. As team members consistently examine each other’s work, they cultivate a strong sense of shared responsibility and accountability. This collective oversight encourages every member to maintain high standards and thoroughness in their coding efforts. For example, the awareness that their peers will scrutinize their code motivates developers to initially write cleaner and more efficient code. This proactive approach to coding quality reduces the likelihood of future extensive rewrites, streamlining the development process and enhancing overall productivity.</p>
<p>Code reviews frequently catalyze discussions that yield more efficient, elegant, or simpler solutions than those initially implemented. This aspect of code reviews is particularly valuable as it taps into the collective expertise and experience of the team to enhance the overall software design. For instance, consider a developer who implements a function to sort a vector inefficiently. During the code review, another team member might notice the inefficiency and suggest a more effective sorting algorithm or recommend leveraging existing utilities from the standard library. Such suggestions not only improve performance but also simplify the code, reducing complexity and potential for errors, thus making the software more robust and maintainable.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-314"><a id="_idTextAnchor313"/>Preparing for code reviews</h1>
<p>Before delving <a id="_idIndexMarker865"/>into the collaborative process of code reviews, teams must prepare adequately to ensure that these reviews are as effective and efficient as possible. This preparation not only sets the stage for a smoother review process but also minimizes the time spent on avoidable issues, allowing teams to focus on more substantive and impactful discussions.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-315"><a id="_idTextAnchor314"/>Clear guidelines</h2>
<p>The foundation <a id="_idIndexMarker866"/>of an effective code review process is the establishment and documentation of clear, specific coding guidelines tailored to C++. These guidelines should cover various aspects of coding, including style, practices, and the use of language-specific features. By setting these standards, teams create a common language that reduces ambiguity and ensures consistency across the codebase.</p>
<p>Incorporating as much automation as possible into these guidelines can significantly streamline the review process. Tools such as formatters ensure a consistent coding style, while static analysis tools can automatically detect potential errors or code smells before human reviewers ever look at the code. Additionally, ensuring that all code submissions are accompanied by passing unit tests and, where applicable, end-to-end tests can prevent many common software defects from ever reaching the review stage. This level of automation not only saves time for reviewers but also reduces the potential for disputes over subjective preferences in coding style or minor oversights.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-316"><a id="_idTextAnchor315"/>Self-review</h2>
<p>Another crucial aspect <a id="_idIndexMarker867"/>of preparing for code reviews is the practice of self-review. Before submitting their code for peer review, developers should thoroughly examine their own work. This is where tools such as linters and static analysis come into play, helping to catch common issues that can be easily overlooked.</p>
<p>Self-review encourages developers to take responsibility for their code’s initial quality, reducing the burden on peer reviewers and fostering a culture of accountability. It also allows developers to reflect on their work and consider potential improvements before involving others, which can lead to higher-quality submissions and more productive review sessions. A developer should methodically evaluate their work by asking the following questions before submitting their code for peer review. This reflective practice helps to refine the <a id="_idIndexMarker868"/>code, align it more closely with project goals, and prepare the developer for any subsequent discussions during the code review process:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong class="bold">Did I need to write code? (Is my change rational?)</strong> Before adding new code, consider whether the change is necessary. Evaluate whether the functionality is essential and justify the addition, keeping in mind the potential for increasing complexity in the codebase.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">What could I do to avoid writing code? (Is there a third-party library or tool that I can utilize?)</strong> Always look for opportunities to leverage existing solutions. Using well-tested third-party libraries or tools can often achieve the desired functionality without adding new code, thereby reducing potential bugs and maintenance overhead.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Is my code readable?</strong> Assess the clarity of your code. Good code should be self-explanatory to other engineers who might not be familiar with it. Use meaningful variable names, maintain a clean structure, and include comments where necessary to explain complex logic.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Do other engineers need to understand the logic of my code?</strong> Consider whether your code can be understood independently by other developers. It is crucial that others can follow the logic without needing extensive explanations, which facilitates easier maintenance and integration.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Does my code look similar to the rest of the codebase?</strong> Ensure that your code adheres to the established coding styles and patterns in the project. Consistency across the codebase helps maintain uniformity, making the software easier to read and less prone to errors during integration.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Is my code efficient?</strong> Evaluate the efficiency of your code. It’s important to consider resource usage, such as CPU time and memory, especially in performance-critical applications. Review your algorithms and data structures to ensure they are optimal for the task.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Do my tests cover edge cases?</strong> Confirm that your tests are comprehensive, particularly checking that they cover edge cases. Robust tests are crucial for ensuring the resilience and reliability of your code under unusual or unexpected conditions.</li>
</ol>
<p>By answering these<a id="_idIndexMarker869"/> questions during the self-review process, developers not only enhance the quality of the code they write but also streamline the peer review process. This thoughtful approach minimizes the likelihood of significant revisions during peer reviews and increases the overall effectiveness of the code review cycle. This preparation can lead to more informed and constructive discussions during code reviews, as developers are already aware of and have addressed many potential concerns.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-317"><a id="_idTextAnchor316"/>How to pass a code review</h1>
<p>Successfully navigating the<a id="_idIndexMarker870"/> code review process is crucial for maintaining the quality of the software and fostering a positive and productive team environment. Here, we outline essential strategies for developers aiming to ensure their code passes a review smoothly and effectively.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-318"><a id="_idTextAnchor317"/>Discuss big features with reviewers and code owners before writing code</h2>
<p>Before embarking on the development of significant features, it is advisable to consult with code reviewers and owners. This preliminary discussion should focus on the proposed design, implementation approach, and how the feature fits into the existing codebase. Engaging in this dialogue early helps align expectations, reduces the likelihood of significant revisions later, and ensures that the feature integrates seamlessly with other parts of the project.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-319"><a id="_idTextAnchor318"/>Go over your code before publishing it</h2>
<p>Perform a thorough review of your own code before submitting it for peer review. This self-assessment should cover the logic, style, and adherence to the project’s coding standards. Look <a id="_idIndexMarker871"/>for any areas of improvement or potential simplification. Ensuring that your submission is as refined as possible not only facilitates a smoother review process but also demonstrates your diligence and respect for the reviewers’ time.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-320"><a id="_idTextAnchor319"/>Make sure the code is compliant with the code convention</h2>
<p>Adherence to established code conventions is critical. These conventions, which cover everything from naming schemes to layout and procedural practices, ensure consistency throughout the codebase. Consistency leads to code that is easier to read, understand, and maintain. Before submitting for review, check that your code strictly follows these guidelines to avoid any unnecessary back-and-forth during the review process.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-321"><a id="_idTextAnchor320"/>Code review is a conversation, not an order</h2>
<p>It is essential to approach code review as a dialogue rather than a directive. Reviewers typically provide comments and suggestions that are meant to initiate discussion rather than act as unilateral commands. Especially for junior developers, it is important to understand that you are encouraged to engage in these discussions. If a suggestion or correction is unclear, seek clarification rather than silently making changes. This interaction not only aids your professional development but also enhances the collaborative spirit of the review process.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-322"><a id="_idTextAnchor321"/>Remember – your code is not you</h2>
<p>A vital lesson I learned from my former boss, Vladi Lyga, is that “<em class="italic">Your code is not you</em>.” Developers often invest significant effort and pride in their code, and it can be challenging to receive criticism. However, it’s crucial to remember that feedback on your code is not a personal critique of you as a developer or individual. The aim is to improve the project and ensure the highest quality outcome, and this sometimes requires constructive criticism. Detaching their personal identity from their work allows developers to approach feedback more objectively and use it as a growth opportunity.</p>
<p>By preparing<a id="_idIndexMarker872"/> thoroughly, engaging in open dialogue, and embracing a constructive perspective towards feedback, developers can effectively navigate the code review process. These practices not only enhance the quality of the code but also contribute to a more supportive and collaborative team environment.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-323"><a id="_idTextAnchor322"/>How to efficiently dispute during a code review</h1>
<p>Disagreements <a id="_idIndexMarker873"/>are a natural part of the code review process. Different perspectives can lead to conflicts over approaches, implementations, or interpretations of best practices. Handling these disputes efficiently is crucial to maintaining a productive review process and a healthy team environment. Here are key strategies to manage disagreements effectively during code reviews.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-324"><a id="_idTextAnchor323"/>Clear justification for changes</h2>
<p>It is imperative for reviewers to not only point out areas needing improvement but also to clearly explain why changes are necessary. When suggesting a modification, a reviewer should provide a rationale that is anchored in best practices, performance considerations, or design principles relevant to the project. Including links to coding standards, articles, documentation, or other authoritative resources can greatly enhance the clarity and persuasiveness of the arguments. This approach helps the reviewee understand the reasoning behind the feedback, making it more likely for them to see the value of the suggested changes.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-325"><a id="_idTextAnchor324"/>Reciprocal explanation from reviewees</h2>
<p>Similarly, if a reviewee disagrees with a comment or suggestion, they should also articulate their reasoning clearly. This explanation should detail why their approach or solution was chosen, supported by relevant technical justifications, documentation, or precedents within the project. By providing a well-reasoned argument, the reviewee fosters a more informed discussion, which can lead to a better understanding or an improved solution.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-326"><a id="_idTextAnchor325"/>Direct communication</h2>
<p>When a dispute involves more than a couple of comments back and forth, it’s advisable to shift the conversation <a id="_idIndexMarker874"/>from written comments to a direct dialogue. This can be through a video call, phone call, or face-to-face meeting, depending on what’s feasible. Direct communication can prevent the kind of miscommunication and escalation often seen in text-based discussions, which can quickly become unproductive and contentious, much like lengthy threads seen on platforms such as Reddit.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-327"><a id="_idTextAnchor326"/>Involving additional perspectives</h2>
<p>If a resolution cannot be reached between the reviewer and the reviewee, it can be beneficial to involve additional perspectives. Bringing in a third engineer, a product manager, a QA specialist, or even an architect can provide new insights and help mediate the disagreement. These parties may offer alternative solutions, compromise approaches, or a decision based on broader project priorities and impacts. Their input can be crucial in breaking deadlocks and ensuring that the decision is well rounded and aligns with overall project goals.</p>
<p>Efficient dispute resolution during code reviews is vital for keeping the review process constructive and focused on enhancing the quality of the codebase. By explaining the rationale behind feedback, encouraging direct communication, and involving additional perspectives when necessary, teams can resolve disagreements effectively and maintain a positive, collaborative environment. This approach not only resolves conflicts but also strengthens the team’s ability to work through future challenges collaboratively.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-328"><a id="_idTextAnchor327"/>How to be a good reviewer</h1>
<p>The role of a<a id="_idIndexMarker875"/> reviewer in the code review process is crucial not just for ensuring the technical quality of code but also for maintaining a constructive, respectful, and educational environment. The following are some key practices<a id="_idIndexMarker876"/> that define a good reviewer.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-329"><a id="_idTextAnchor328"/>Initiate the conversation</h2>
<p>Start the review process by initiating a friendly conversation with the reviewee. This can be a brief message acknowledging the effort they have put into the <strong class="bold">pull request</strong> (<strong class="bold">PR</strong>) and setting a positive tone for the upcoming review. A cordial start helps to build rapport with the reviewee, making the subsequent exchange more open and collaborative.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-330"><a id="_idTextAnchor329"/>Maintain politeness and respect</h2>
<p>Always be polite and <a id="_idIndexMarker877"/>respectful in your comments. Remember that the reviewee has invested significant effort into their code. Critiques should be constructive, focusing on the code and its improvement rather than on the individual. Phrasing feedback in the form of questions or suggestions rather than directives can also help to keep the tone positive and encouraging.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-331"><a id="_idTextAnchor330"/>Review manageable chunks</h2>
<p>Limit the amount of code you review at one time to about 400 lines, if possible. Reviewing large chunks<a id="_idIndexMarker878"/> of code can lead to fatigue, which increases the likelihood of missing both minor and critical issues. Breaking down reviews into manageable parts not only enhances the effectiveness of the review process but also helps to maintain a high level of attention to detail.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-332"><a id="_idTextAnchor331"/>Avoid personal bias</h2>
<p>While reviewing, it’s important to distinguish between code that must be changed for objective reasons—such as syntax errors, logical errors, or deviations from project standards—and changes that reflect personal coding preferences. For example, let us consider the following code snippet:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
std::string toString(bool done) {
  if (done) {
    return "done";
  } else {
    return "not done";
  }
}</pre>
<p>Some engineers might prefer to rewrite this function the following way:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
std::string toString(bool done) {
  if (done) {
    return "done";
  }
  return "not done";
}</pre>
<p>While the<a id="_idIndexMarker879"/> second version is a bit more concise, the first version is equally valid and adheres to the project’s coding standards. If you feel strongly about a personal preference that could enhance the code, clearly label it as such. Indicate that it is a suggestion based on personal preference and not a mandatory change. This clarity helps the reviewee understand which changes are essential for compliance with project standards and which are optional enhancements.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-333"><a id="_idTextAnchor332"/>Focus on understandability</h2>
<p>One of the <a id="_idIndexMarker880"/>most critical questions to ask yourself as a reviewer is whether the code is understandable enough that you, or someone else on the team, could fix it in the middle of the night. This question cuts to the heart of code maintainability. If the answer is no, it’s important to discuss ways to improve the code’s clarity and simplicity. Code that is easily understood is easier to maintain and debug, which is crucial for long-term project health.</p>
<p>Being a good reviewer involves much more than just identifying flaws in code. It requires initiating and maintaining a supportive dialogue, respecting and acknowledging the efforts of your peers, managing your review workload effectively, and providing clear, helpful feedback that prioritizes the project’s standards over personal preferences. By fostering a positive and productive review environment, you contribute not only to the quality of the code but also to the growth and cohesion of your development team.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-334"><a id="_idTextAnchor333"/>Summary</h1>
