- en: In the last part of the book, you will give the inhabitants of your virtual
    worlds a place to live. You will explore the differences between instance and
    level data, and you will implement a loader for level data, either found on the
    internet or created by yourself. You will also learn how collision detection between
    instances and level geometry is handled, allowing the instances not only to avoid
    walls but also to walk on the floor of the loaded level. Then, you will be introduced
    to pathfinding and navigation within the level, enabling the instances to roam
    around between waypoints in the game map. Finally, you will be presented with
    a collection of ideas and resources to upgrade the animation editor to a small
    game engine.
