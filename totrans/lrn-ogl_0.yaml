- en: 'OpenGL is the most popular graphics library in the world; most mobile games
    use OpenGL and many other applications. In this book, you''ll get to learn about
    the fundamentals that make the awesome games we play and the game engines behind
    them. A step-by-step process is used to show everything, from setting up OpenGL
    to its essential modern features. You''ll gain a good understanding of the following
    concepts: setting up on Windows and Mac using GLFW, SDL, and SFML, 2D drawing,
    3D drawing, texturing, lighting, 3D rendering, Shaders/GLSL, model loading, and
    cube mapping.'

- en: Learn OpenGL is for anyone and everyone who is interested in creating games,
    learning how game engines work, and most importantly for anyone who is interested
    in learning OpenGL. The ideal reader for this book would be anyone with a passion
    for learning game development or looking out for an OpenGL reference guide. The
    skills that you'll learn in this book will be applicable to all your game development
    needs. You'll require a strong foundation in C++ to understand and apply the concepts
    of this book.

    In this chapter, you''ll get to learn how to set up OpenGL using various libraries:
    GLFW, GLEW, SDL, and SFML. We''ll learn how to set up our OpenGL projects on Windows
    and Mac. We also discuss how to link the libraries to your projects using absolute
    or relative linking, and eventually create the rendering windows to display OpenGL
    graphics.'

    Applying Textures*, takes you through drawing various shapes using shaders. We''ll
    begin by drawing a triangle and learn to add color to it. Then, we''ll use the
    triangle concept to draw our quadrilateral and also learn how to add texture to
    it.'

    Projections, and Camera*, This chapter further builds on the previous chapter.
    You''ll get to grips with applying transformations such as rotation and translation
    to our shapes, and learn to draw a cube and apply a texture to it. Then, we explore
    the concepts of projections (perspective and orthographic) and implement those
    concepts in our game world.'

    Materials, and Lightmaps*, In this chapter we''ll learn to apply colors to our
    objects and how to create a light source such as a lamp in our game world. We''ll
    then look at the effects of light on the objects. You''ll understand different
    types of lighting techniques: ambient, diffused, specular lighting. We''ll also
    explore the various real worl materials and observe the effects of light on the
    materials. You''ll also get to learn about lightmaps in this chapter.'

    sources such as directional lights, point lights, and spotlights. We''ll also
    learn to combine the lighting effects and the light sources for our game world.'

    Using a Cubemap*, In this chapter, you''ll generate a skybox using a cubemap.
    You''ll learn how to apply textures to the skybox and then create a separate texture
    file to make loading of textures in the code easier. You''ll also learn to draw
    the skybox and create our game world using it.'

    In this chapter, you''ll learn how to setup Assimp (Open Asset Import Library)
    on Windows using CMake for all our Model Loading needs. We''ll also cover setting
    up Assimp on Mac OS X and creating a cross-platform Mesh Class. Then we''ll explore
    how to load a 3D model into our game. You''ll also get to learn how to create
    a Model Class to handle loading of our model.'

    as in this book you will be using OpenGL with C++. It's not the easiest thing,
    OpenGL. If this is your first time coding or you haven't been coding for long,
    it is recommended you get a good grasp of C++ and then continue with the book.
