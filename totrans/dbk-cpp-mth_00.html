     Preface
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     Imagine C++ as a mythical, ancient language, descended from the ones, forged in the fires of low-level magic, tempered with the precision of high-level incantations.
    
    
     Born out of the need to both control the machine and present an abstraction, it is a tool wielded by those who seek to bridge the chasm between raw machine and high-level constructs, while still accessing the luxury of
    
    
     
      modern tools.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Imagine this book as unlike any other you have encountered.
    
    
     The authors have embarked on a daring quest, navigating the labyrinthine depths of C++ to shed light on its true nature.
    
    
     With courage and precision, they aim to strip away the layers of myth and mystery that have long surrounded this fabled language, tackling both its triumphs and its
    
    
     
      perceived flaws.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Approach this book with an open mind, for it promises a journey unlike any other, a journey not suited to the faint of heart.
    
    
     The authors dive headfirst into the complex reputation of C++, confronting its infamous pointers and intricate memory management, and even descending into the depths of low-level C++, where assembly reigns and pointers are simply numbers.
    
    
     We look at the different C++s that exist out there, at the ecosystem around C++, at how to learn it today, and at the things you’d do better to forget about.
    
    
     Through each chapter, we peel back the layers, uncovering the underlying logic and elegance within these powerful constructs.
    
    
     With stories of C++ legends and a touch of humor (albeit sometimes questionable), we aim to keep you engaged while guiding you through both the sublime and the absurd.
    
    
     Expect to encounter some of the worst code you’ve ever seen, presented intentionally to teach you what not to do, all while illuminating the true potential of C++.
    
    
     This is a book designed not just to teach but also to reveal the soul of C++ through both its virtues and
    
    
     
      its pitfalls.

     Who this book is for
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     This book, with its myth-busting, semi-humorous approach, is perfect for programmers who already have a working knowledge of C++ but want to go deeper into its nuances and mysteries.
    
    
     It could also appeal to curious learners and computer science students who are intrigued by the language’s reputation for both power
    
    
     
      and complexity.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     This audience includes those who appreciate the artistic and philosophical sides of programming – developers who don’t just want to use C++ but also understand why it works as it does, and the lore behind its most famous (and infamous) features.
    
    
     It’s for those who see programming not just as a skill but as a craft, one shaped by history, quirks, and even a bit
    
    
     
      of legend.

      C++ Is Very Difficult to Learn
     
    </em>
    
     , looks at why this is the case: is it the language or is it the teaching method?
    
    
     Should we start with low-level features such as pointers and memory management first, or would it perhaps be better to start with working examples or with the OOP features?
    
    
     Also, does every C++ programmer need to know the same C++?
    
    
     The chapter discusses different approaches to learning a language, with a focus on C++, and decides whether C++ is still difficult to learn today ...
    
    
     with the right
    
    
     
      method.

     In an ideal world, maybe they would be!
    
    
     In reality, every C++ program should be compliant.
    
    
     However, as we discover in this chapter, when they stray a little to the left or right, using an obscure compiler extension, dabbling in undefined behavior, or relying on a particular platform’s quirks, you instantly might find yourself in a tangle of errors only decipherable by ancient mystics.
    
    
     So, sure, every C++ program is “compliant” ...
    
    
     until it’s
    
    
     
      not!

      The Fastest C++ Code Is Inline Assembly

     While assembly does indeed offer low-level control, modern compilers are highly optimized and often generate more efficient code than hand-written assembly, as we will demonstrate in the chapter.
    
    
     Indeed, inline assembly can improve performance in some cases, but it sacrifices readability and portability, so use it sparingly and only when absolutely
    
    
     
      necessary.

     It’s a poetic dance of keywords, templates, ancient macros, and overloaded operators, all elegantly arranged to make even the most seasoned programmers question their life choices.
    
    
     Truly, as the chapter will showcase, C++ syntax is the epitome of beauty, if beauty means a riddle wrapped in an enigma, with just a hint of confusion after preprocessing again the
    
    
     
      unpreprocessable.
