			<h1 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor366"/>How and Why to Keep Your Code Clean</h1>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Chapters 1</em> to <em class="italic">4</em>, we learned all the basics of programming and are about to dive deep into developing our very <span class="No-Break">own game.</span></p>
			<p>But before we do so, we must realize that the code base for games can grow very large. This means that the code and systems we write one day can be buried under other code and systems. As a result, returning to our earlier work can be a hassle because we forget how or why we coded certain things in a <span class="No-Break">certain way.</span></p>
			<p>That is why now is the ideal moment to stand still and think about how to keep our code clean and understandable even months after writing it. Most of the things in this chapter were learned through making mistakes myself and having to find a solution in books <span class="No-Break">and articles.</span></p>
			<p>Although most of the tips can feel like critical thinking and will bring you to the same point (which they probably will), it always helps to voice them and explain why programmers <span class="No-Break">employ them.</span></p>
			<p>Holding them in the back of your mind while programming will give you a big step up from other <span class="No-Break">starting programmers.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following <span class="No-Break">main topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Naming <span class="No-Break">things (again)</span></li>
				<li>Writing <span class="No-Break">good functions</span></li>
				<li>Why use private variables <span class="No-Break">and functions</span></li>
				<li>Don’t repeat <span class="No-Break">yourself (DRY)</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Defensive programming</span></li>
				<li>Coding <span class="No-Break">style guides</span></li>
			</ul>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor369"/>Back to naming things</h1>
			<p>Let’s have another look at how to name variables, functions, and classes. Picking the right name for any of these is very important as it will make understanding the code <span class="No-Break">way easier.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor370"/>Naming conventions</h2>
			<p>As we saw in <em class="italic">Chapters 3</em> and <em class="italic">4</em>, variable, function, and class names have different constraints. We used <a id="_idIndexMarker289"/>specific rules to name each. These ways are called <strong class="bold">naming conventions</strong>. They give a term to how we want to constrain the formation of names. The three main naming conventions that are recommended in the GDScript style guide are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">snake_case</strong>: We have <a id="_idIndexMarker290"/>used this naming convention to name all our variables and methods. It is called <strong class="bold">snake_case</strong> because <a id="_idIndexMarker291"/>each word is connected by an underscore, which looks like a little snake. Example names could be the following: <strong class="source-inline">player_health</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">movement_speed</strong>, <span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">weekly_highscore</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE</strong>: This is the convention we use to name constants. It is <a id="_idIndexMarker292"/>exactly the same as snake case, only <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>all the alphabetical characters are uppercase. Example names could be the following: <strong class="source-inline">BUTTON_SIZE</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">PI</strong>, <span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">TEAM_A_COLOR</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">PascalCase</strong>: We <a id="_idIndexMarker294"/>have used this naming convention to name classes and nodes in the scene. It is called <strong class="bold">PascalCase</strong> because <a id="_idIndexMarker295"/>it was popularized in the programming language <strong class="bold">Pascal</strong>. In this convention, we start every word within the name with a capital letter and the rest are lowercase. Example names could be the following: <strong class="source-inline">BackgroundColor</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">PlayerWeapon</strong>, <span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">GameStartTimer</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are a <a id="_idIndexMarker296"/>bunch of <a id="_idIndexMarker297"/>other, more exotic conventions, like <a id="_idIndexMarker298"/>the following: <strong class="bold">kebab-case</strong>, <strong class="bold">camelCase</strong>, <strong class="bold">flatcase</strong>, and so on. But these are not used <span class="No-Break">in <a id="_idTextAnchor371"/>GDScript.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor372"/>General naming tips</h2>
			<p>Now, let me be clear: naming things is not easy. It is, in fact, one of the hardest things in programming. So, if you <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/>have the naming right, you’ll always be able to return to any <span class="No-Break">code quickly.</span></p>
			<p>Here are some tips to make you a <span class="No-Break">nami<a id="_idTextAnchor373"/>ng master.</span></p>
			<h3>Use meaningful and descriptive names</h3>
			<p>In the early days, programmers had to work with computers that didn’t have a lot of computational power and memory, and they also prided themselves in creating the shortest <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>script to solve a problem. This resulted in code where variables were given one or two-letter names such as <strong class="source-inline">a</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">c5</strong>. Optimizing a piece of code to be as short as possible is very satisfying. However, these pieces of code are very incomprehensible. Even the person who wrote the script is not able to read it anymore after some time <span class="No-Break">has passed.</span></p>
			<p>That is why descriptive variable names are a big plus. Sure, they take a few extra seconds to type out, but that is nothing compared to spending minutes or even hours figuring out why a variable exists and how it should be used; and, anyway, autocomplete will always help <span class="No-Break">us out.</span></p>
			<p>Some people even go as far as to say that short variable names result in a better-performing game. This is not true at all. A programming language will tokenize the variables in the code, making any variable name perform equally fast, no matter <span class="No-Break">how long.</span></p>
			<p>The trick is making a variable’s, method’s, or class’s name meaningful and descriptive. To do this, you can ask yourself these questions for the <span class="No-Break">diffe<a id="_idTextAnchor374"/>rent types:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Variables</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li>What kind of data will the <span class="No-Break">variable contain?</span></li><li>How should this da<a id="_idTextAnchor375"/>ta <span class="No-Break">be used?</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Functions</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li>What does the <span class="No-Break">function do?</span></li><li>What data does the <span class="No-Break">function return?</span></li><li>What kind of parameters does the function requi<a id="_idTextAnchor376"/>re <span class="No-Break">to work?</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Classes</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li>What will the class be <span class="No-Break">used for?</span></li><li>What data is the class <span class="No-Break">responsible for?</span></li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Using these <a id="_idIndexMarker301"/>questions will guide your decision making while coming up with names for variables, functions,<a id="_idTextAnchor377"/> <span class="No-Break">and classes.</span></p>
			<h3>Avoid filler words</h3>
			<p>Although <a id="_idIndexMarker302"/>long descriptive names are the way to go, we also don’t want to obscure the name with filler or unnecessary words such as <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">The</span></li>
				<li>A</li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Object</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Such words just bog down the name and make it unnecessarily long while providing no <span class="No-Break">e<a id="_idTextAnchor378"/>xtra meaning.</span></p>
			<h3>Keep names pronounceable</h3>
			<p>Good code should be easily readable. This means that you should be able to read it like a book <a id="_idIndexMarker303"/>and it should make sense without you having to look at the content of the function or the data type of <span class="No-Break">the variables.</span></p>
			<p>This also means that we should keep names pronounceable. Use complete words or very common abbreviations if we decide to <span class="No-Break">a<a id="_idTextAnchor379"/>bbreviate one.</span></p>
			<h3>Be consistent</h3>
			<p>Now, for the most important tip: be consistent in your naming. This way, you can count on your own style of naming and make assumptions about the variables, functions, and classes you <a id="_idIndexMarker304"/>write. If you break any of the rules, at least break them consistently, and don’t just do something differ<a id="_idTextAnchor380"/>ent <span class="No-Break">every time.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor381"/>Public and private class members</h2>
			<p>In <a href="B19358_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor164"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, we learned <a id="_idIndexMarker305"/>that <strong class="bold">abstraction</strong> and <strong class="bold">encapsulation</strong> are two key <a id="_idIndexMarker306"/>components of <strong class="bold">object-oriented programming</strong>. This means that <a id="_idIndexMarker307"/>code outside of a class should not need to worry <a id="_idIndexMarker308"/>about how that class gets results. For all the outside <a id="_idIndexMarker309"/>world is concerned, it could be magic or, even worse, <span class="No-Break">manual labor.</span></p>
			<p>To signify that a particular variable or method is meant for internal use by the class alone, GDScript took over the convention popularized in Python: putting an underscore before the name of that variable <span class="No-Break">or function.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer062">
					<img alt="Figure 5.1 – The auto-complete still suggests private variables" src="image/B19358_05_01.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.1 – The auto-complete still suggests private variables</p>
			<p>However, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em>, you’ll notice that the auto-complete still suggests pri<a id="_idTextAnchor382"/>vate class members. It is still very important to indicate which members of the class are private and should not be accessed. This will help you or any other programmer coming after you by usin<a id="_idTextAnchor383"/>g the <span class="No-Break">class itself.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor384"/>Make short functions</h2>
			<p>The more a function tries to do, the more code there is within that function and the harder it is to <a id="_idIndexMarker310"/>understand what it is doing. So, to keep functions easily understandable, a great rule of thumb is to keep the number of lines under 20. This lets you quickly understand what is happening and how to use the <span class="No-Break">function effectively.</span></p>
			<p>Of course, you can call different functions. Splitting long functions into multiple smaller ones with a good descriptive name will save you many hours of figuring<a id="_idTextAnchor385"/> out what <span class="No-Break">code does.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor386"/>DRY</h1>
			<p>There are two acronyms that almost every programming student will have heard of. The first is DRY. This <a id="_idIndexMarker311"/>acronym urges us to write a piece of code only once and then reuse it as much as possible. If we create small, generic functions, we can prevent copy-pasting the same few lines over our whole <span class="No-Break">code base.</span></p>
			<p>But I should also warn you not to overdo it. Sometimes, it is okay to have a little bit of duplicate code that is better tailored to a particular scenario than to hack multiple scenarios into one piece of code. Us<a id="_idTextAnchor387"/>e your <span class="No-Break">best judgment.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor388"/>Do one thing (KISS)</h1>
			<p>The second <a id="_idIndexMarker312"/>acronym everyone knows about is <strong class="bold">KISS</strong>, which stands for <strong class="bold">keep it simple, stupid</strong>. This could be interpreted in <span class="No-Break">two ways:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Keep the solution to the bare minimum, which means you don’t solve problems that do not exist yet. This way, you don’t develop features that are not needed and don’t spend time creating something nobody <span class="No-Break">will use.</span></li>
				<li>Don’t make your code complex. Complex code is notoriously hard to maintain and understand. That is why it’s better to keep any solution simple, so you always know what <span class="No-Break">is happening.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Simple code is always easier to read, comprehend, and maintain. So, <a id="_idTextAnchor389"/>keep it <span class="No-Break">simple, stupid!</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor390"/>Defensive programming</h1>
			<p>The last principle I want to show you is <strong class="bold">defensive programming</strong>. In this paradigm, you try to <a id="_idIndexMarker313"/>play it safe by checking as many things and edge cases in code as possible. In a function, for example, you can check at the start of the function whether the parameters are correct. This way, you will prevent a lot of crashes in the <span class="No-Break">long run.</span></p>
			<p>For example, if you have a function that should return the item within an inventory at a certain index, you could write it non-defensively and defensively <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
func get_inventory_item(index: int):
   return inventory[index]
func  get_inventory_item (index: int):
   if index &lt; 0 or index &gt;= inventory.size():
      return
   return inventory[index]</pre>			<p>The second version of the function is defensive because it checks first if the index of the item we want is within the range of the inventory. We do this because if the index is outside of this ra<a id="_idTextAnchor391"/>nge, we crash <span class="No-Break">the game.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor392"/>Programming style guides</h1>
			<p>Lastly, I would like to go over what programming style guides are. These are guides that tell you how <a id="_idIndexMarker314"/>to structure your code. These guides never say anything about the content of the code but more about how to <span class="No-Break">style it.</span></p>
			<p>You can compare these guides to the style of this book. I could put all the sentences in one long line without styling, headers, or images. But in the end, this would make the content very hard <span class="No-Break">to comprehend.</span></p>
			<p>Next to making code more readable, these style guides also get whole teams of coders on one line, so each person’s code looks more alike and people don’t have to keep switching between different coding styles when trying to comprehend the code base of <span class="No-Break">a project.</span></p>
			<p>Most companies have their internal style guide, and yes, there is an official GDScript style guide! You can read it over <span class="No-Break">here: </span><a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html"><span class="No-Break">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>I don’t recommend you read the whole thing and try to apply it all at once. Instead, you could read some snippets here and there and once you have those guidelines down, read some more <a id="_idIndexMarker315"/>and try to fit these in your own <span class="No-Break">coding style.</span></p>
			<p>Don’t get mistaken. Even with these style guides, there is still room for a personal touch while coding. These guides will just be within a framework that makes your code nicer and easier to understand for other programmers working within the same programming language <span class="No-Break">and framework.</span></p>
			<p>For the rest of this chapter, I would like to review some of the tips from the official GDScript style guide. Namely, the <span class="No-Break">following few:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">White spacing</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Blank lines</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Line length</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>So let’s dive right into these style recommendations of the Godot Eng<a id="_idTextAnchor393"/>ine <span class="No-Break">developers themselves.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor394"/>White spacing</h2>
			<p>Except for indentation, which we discussed in <a href="B19358_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, GDScript doesn’t care about white space <a id="_idIndexMarker316"/>within lines of code. The next two lines are functionally <span class="No-Break">the same:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
var total_damage:float=100+get_damage()*0.5
var total_damage: float = 100 + get_damage() * 0.5</pre>			<p>However, the second line is way more readable for humans because each part has room to breathe. That is why it’s essential to always use a space between numbers, function calls, and operators. This way, a line doesn’t just become a jumble <span class="No-Break">of characters.</span></p>
			<p>In arrays, we also want to add a space between elements to clearly show that each is a <span class="No-Break">separate entity:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
inventory = ["Boots","Sword","Potion"]
inventory = ["Boots", "Sword", "Potion"]</pre>			<p>The opposite can also be true. Inserting unnecessary spaces could obscure certain operators, for example, accessing a key in <span class="No-Break">a dictionary:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
dictionary ["key"] = 100
dictionary["key"] = 100</pre>			<p>In the preceding example, it is more apparent that the square brackets are there to access a key <a id="_idIndexMarker317"/>from the dictionary and not to define <span class="No-Break">an array.</span></p>
			<p>Two other examples where no space shows a clear relation between the elements are the function name and its <span class="No-Break">parameter list:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
print ("Hello")
print("Hello")</pre>			<p>Also, we can see this when accessing a member variable or function from <span class="No-Break">an object:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
object . function()
object.function()</pre>			<p>In general, it is very important to use white space within a line of code to show when things are separate entities or belong together. This will improv<a id="_idTextAnchor395"/>e <span class="No-Break">readability tremendously.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor396"/>Blank lines</h2>
			<p>The other kind of white space we can use to make code more readable is blank lines. A blank line is <a id="_idIndexMarker318"/>simply a line that contains nothing. The style guide suggests using two blank lines to separate functions and class definitions. This way, it is clear which pieces of text belong together as <span class="No-Break">a function:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
func deal_damage(amount: float) -&gt; void:
   player_health -= amount
func heal(amount: float) -&gt; void:
   player_health += amount</pre>			<p>In addition to separating functions and classes with two blank lines, the guide advises us to use one blank line to separate lines of code that are logically grouped. For example, if we have <a id="_idIndexMarker319"/>code that calculates the damage from an attack and then applies that damage to all enemies, we can nicely group this logic into <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Determining <span class="No-Break">the damage</span></li>
				<li>Calculating the <span class="No-Break">total damage</span></li>
				<li>Applying the damage to <span class="No-Break">all enemies</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We can see this in the <span class="No-Break">following code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
var weapon_damage: float = 10
var damage_type: String = "Fire"
var total_damage: float = weapon_damage
if damage_type == "Electricity":
   total_damage *= 2
for enemy in enemies:
   enemy.deal_damage(total_damage)</pre>			<p>You will see me sin against the blank lines guide rules here and there throughout the book. I do this mainly to make the code more compact to fit the pages, but that doesn’t <a id="_idTextAnchor397"/>make the rule <span class="No-Break">less important!</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor398"/>Line length</h2>
			<p>In the early days, computer monitors were tiny. They often couldn’t hold more than 70 to 90 characters in one line of text before it scrolled off the end or wrapped around. That is why <a id="_idIndexMarker320"/>code was best written in lines with, at most, this length. Nowadays, my ultra-wide computer monitor can hold over 500 characters on one line without a problem. Well, not a technical problem anyway. Working with text this wide makes it very hard to read <span class="No-Break">for humans!</span></p>
			<p>This is why people still restrict their line lengths while programming, to keep everything nice and easy to read. While, of course, not everyone agrees on the perfect line length, the GDScript defaults are 80 characters as a soft limit and <strong class="source-inline">100</strong> as a <span class="No-Break">hard limit.</span></p>
			<p>It is advised to keep your lines under this amount of characters. If you do run into them, you can always subdivide your line by storing intermediate results in separate variables. For example, the next snippet of code checks if the player’s health is between <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">100</strong> and whether the player has a potion in <span class="No-Break">their inventory:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
if player_health &gt; 0 and player_health &lt; 100 and inventory.has("Potion"):
   # Take potion</pre>			<p>It’s not technically too long, but to show how we can lower the line length and even make the condition in the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement more readable, let’s rewrite this snippet <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
var can_heal: bool = player_health &gt; 0 and player_health &lt; 100
var has_potion: bool = inventory.has("Potion")
if can_heal and has_potion:
   # Take potion</pre>			<p>As you can see, there are no extra-long lines now and the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> s<a id="_idTextAnchor399"/>tatement is way <span class="No-Break">more readable.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor400"/>Utilizing the documentation</h1>
			<p>Sometimes, it is hard to anticipate how the built-in classes, functions, or variables of the Godot Engine <a id="_idIndexMarker321"/>work. Luckily, the engine has great documentation that explains everything in <span class="No-Break">great detail.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor401"/>Accessing a class’s documentation</h2>
			<p>We can always access the documentation of any internal class by simply using <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + clicking <a id="_idIndexMarker322"/>on the name of the class. This will take you to the specific documentation page of <span class="No-Break">that class.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer063">
					<img alt="Figure 5.2 – Ctrl + clicking on an internal class name, such as the Array class" src="image/B19358_05_02.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.2 – Ctrl + clicking on an internal class name, such as the Array class</p>
			<p>As shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.3</em>, the documentation page starts with a simple description of what the class is used for and sometimes this part gives <span class="No-Break">usage examples.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer064">
					<img alt="Figure 5.3 – The documentation page for the Array class" src="image/B19358_05_03.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.3 – The documentation page for the Array class</p>
			<p>Then follows an overview of the class’s member functions, variables, signals, and operators. We’ll see more about signals in <a href="B19358_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor590"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>. Note that you can easily click on the function or variable names to directly go to <span class="No-Break">their explanation.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Remember that functions can also be called methods and variables can be called properties. This is because functions bound to a class are called methods and variables bound to a <span class="No-Break">class properties.</span></p>
			<p>After the overview section, there is a detailed description of each function and variable. For the <a id="_idIndexMarker323"/>functions, we get an explanation of what the function does, what parameters the function takes, and what data type <span class="No-Break">gets returned.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer065">
					<img alt="Figure 5.4 – The documentation section for a function" src="image/B19358_05_04.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.4 – The documentation section for a function</p>
			<p>For variables, we also get a description of what this variable is used for and what data type the value <span class="No-Break">should be.</span></p>

			<p>This way of accessing the documentation works very well if we want to get a general feel for what a <span class="No-Break">class does.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor402"/>Directly accessing a function or variable’s documentation</h2>
			<p>To directly go to the documentation of a function or variable, you just have to press <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + click that <a id="_idIndexMarker324"/>function or variable <a id="_idIndexMarker325"/>and you’ll go directly to the <span class="No-Break">relevant section.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor403"/>Going to the definition of a function or variable</h2>
			<p>This shortcut also works with our own code: if you hold <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + click on Windows or Linux or <em class="italic">option</em> + click on <a id="_idIndexMarker326"/>Mac a function or variable that we <a id="_idIndexMarker327"/>defined somewhere, the editor will show where this function or variable was defined in <span class="No-Break">the code.</span></p>
			<p>As an experiment, try using this shortcut on the different functions we defined on the <strong class="source-inline">Enemy</strong> classes we created in <a href="B19358_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor164"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor404"/>Searching the documentation</h2>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker328"/>also search all the classes, functions, and variables. Simply follow <span class="No-Break">these steps:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Press <em class="italic">F1</em> and a search bar will <span class="No-Break">pop up.</span></li>
				<li>Type in any class, function, or variable you want to <span class="No-Break">search for.</span></li>
				<li>Select the right <span class="No-Break">search result.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The result is shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.6</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>

			<p>This makes it <a id="_idIndexMarker329"/>easy to find the right section in the documentation if you are not able to hold <em class="italic">Ctrl + click</em> on Windows and Linux or press <em class="italic">Option + click</em> on Mac, on a class, function, or variable within <span class="No-Break">your code.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-151"><a id="_idTextAnchor405"/>Accessing the online documentation</h2>
			<p>All of this <a id="_idIndexMarker330"/>documentation is also hosted online. There are some pages and tutorials on the online version that you cannot access in the offline one. It’s also easier to open up multiple pages of documentation on the <span class="No-Break">online version.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-152"><a id="_idTextAnchor407"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>There we go! Throughout <em class="italic">Part 1</em> of the book, we learned how to program and we topped it off with some extra tips on becoming a good programmer during this chapter. Remember, no tips in this chapter are chiseled in stone or enforced by the engine. So, you can break them where needed. But they are here for your own good and many programmers have adopted them as <span class="No-Break">daily practices.</span></p>
			<p>In the next chapter, which is also at the beginning of the next part of the book, we will finally start working on our game! <a id="_idTextAnchor408"/>I hope you are as excited as <span class="No-Break">I am!</span></p>
