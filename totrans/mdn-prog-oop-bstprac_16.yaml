    people inhabited. Paranoid self-protection led to rule of the mob and uncommonly
    harsh punishments for crimes of property: hanging was a common consequence for
    those thought to have stolen gold from another.'

  zh: 因为指南没有提到这些，它涵盖了所有这些——以及更多。谁知道未来的智能手机套件中会有什么传感器和能力？它们可能使用能够准确定位用户在人群中的位置的网络。它们可能包括自动人脸识别，当你的朋友附近时发出警报。一部手机可能包括血糖监测器。事实上，由于没有停止涵盖任何特定形式的数据，上述指南涵盖了*所有这些*以及我没有想到的其他任何东西。
- en: 'There''s one thing it doesn''t address: just because a user wants to share
    something, should the app allow it? This is particularly a question that makers
    of apps for children should ask themselves. However, children also deserve impartial
    guidance on what it is a good or a bad idea to share with the innerwebs at large,
    and that should be baked into the app experience. "Please check with a responsible
    adult before pressing this button" does not cut it: just don''t give them the
    button.'

  zh: 有一个问题它没有涉及：用户想要分享某样东西，应用应该允许吗？这尤其是一个应用儿童应用的开发者应该问自己的问题。然而，孩子们也应该得到关于在互联网上分享什么好或不好想的公正指导，这应该融入应用体验中。“在按下此按钮之前请咨询负责任的成年人”是不够的：就是不要给他们按钮。

  zh: 后记
- en: Of course, the picture I drew of the gold rush at the beginning of the chapter
    was deliberately one-sided. As people realized that they could only make tiny
    amounts of easily obtainable gold from single-person techniques such as panning,
    they started to work together. This collaboration – with the new social structures
    and rules attendant – led to technological advances in hydraulic mining, extracting
    both gold and useful minerals.

  zh: 当然，我在本章开头所描述的淘金热是故意带有片面性的。当人们意识到他们只能通过淘洗等单人技术获得微量的易得金子时，他们开始合作。这种合作——伴随着新的社会结构和规则——导致了水力采矿技术的进步，提取了金子和有用的矿物。
