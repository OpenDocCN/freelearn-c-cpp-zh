<p>This book introduces readers to WebAssembly, a new and exciting technology capable of executing languages other than JavaScript in the browser. The book describes how to build a C/JavaScript application from scratch that uses WebAssembly and the process for porting an existing C++ code base to run in the browser with the help of Emscripten.</p>
<p>WebAssembly represents an important shift for the web platform. As a compilation target for languages such as C, C++, and Rust, it provides the ability to build a new class of application. WebAssembly is supported by all of the major browser vendors and represents a collaborative effort.</p>
<p>In this book, we'll describe the elements that make up WebAssembly, as well as its origins. We'll walk through the process of installing the required tools, setting up a development environment, and interacting with WebAssembly. We'll work through simple examples and progress through increasingly advanced use cases. By the end of this book, you'll be well-equipped to use WebAssembly in your C, C++, or JavaScript project.</p>

<p>If you are a C/C++ programmer who wishes to build applications for the web, or a web developer who wishes to improve the performance of their JavaScript applications, then this book is for you. The book is intended for developers familiar with JavaScript who wouldn't mind learning some C and C++ (and vice versa). This book accommodates for C/C++ programmers and JavaScript programmers alike by providing two example applications.</p>

We will write C code to calculate values from accounting transactions and pass the data between JavaScript and the compiled WebAssembly module.</p>
<p><a href="384a3356-a9ca-4c3c-99e7-e632c6228a0b.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Porting a Game with Emscripten</em>, takes a step-by-step approach to porting an existing C++ game to WebAssembly using Emscripten. After reviewing the existing C++ code base, changes are made to the appropriate files to enable the game to run in the browser.</p>
<p><a href="52c9bfe6-6178-4795-8316-09aee11e8e28.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Integrating with Node.js</em>, demonstrates how Node.js and npm can be used with WebAssembly on the server and client side. The chapter covers the use of WebAssembly in an Express application, integrating WebAssembly with webpack, and testing a WebAssembly module using Jest.</p>
<p><a href="93d51e00-521f-4908-ae9d-eeaecb58a01d.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Advanced Tools and Upcoming Features</em>, covers advanced tools, use cases, and new WebAssembly features currently in the process of standardization. This chapter describes WABT, Binaryen, and the tooling available online. In this chapter, you'll learn how to compile WebAssembly modules using LLVM and how WebAssembly modules can be used with Web Workers. The chapter wraps up with a description of the standardization process and a review of some of the exciting features in the process of being added to the specification.</p>

<p>You should have some programming experience and understand concepts such as variables, and functions. If you've never seen a line of JavaScript or C/C++ code, you may want to do some preliminary research before working through the examples in this book. I've chosen to use JavaScript ES6/7 features such as destructuring and arrow functions, so if you haven't worked with JavaScript in the last 3 - 4 years, the syntax may look slightly different.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<kbd>instantiate()</kbd><span> </span>is the primary API for compiling and instantiating WebAssembly code."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>int addTwo(int num) {<br/> return num + 2;<br/>}</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>int calculate(int firstVal, int secondVal) {<br/><strong>return firstVal - secondVal;</strong><br/>}</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>npm install -g webassembly</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "You can do this by pressing the <span class="packt_screen">Start</span> menu button, and right-clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Command Prompt</span> application and selecting <span class="packt_screen">Run as administrator</span>.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
