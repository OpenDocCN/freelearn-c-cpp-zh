- en: The C++ programming language is one of the most widely used in the world and
    it has been so for decades. Its success isn’t due just to the performance it provides
    or maybe to its ease of use, which many would argue against, but probably to its
    versatility. C++ is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language that
    blends together procedural, functional, and generic programming.

- en: '**Generic programming** is a paradigm of writing code such as that entities
    such as functions and classes are written in terms of types that are specified
    later. These generic entities are instantiated only when needed for specific types
    that are specified as arguments. These generic entities are known as templates
    in C++.'

- en: '**Metaprogramming** is the programming technique of using templates (and constexpr
    functions in C++) to generate code at compile-time that is then merged with the
    rest of the source code for compiling a final program. Metaprogramming implies
    that at least an input or an output is a type.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Templates in C++ have a reputation of being *pretty horrendous*, as described
    in the C++ Core Guideless (a document of dos and don’ts maintained by Bjarne Stroustrup
    and Herb Sutter). However, they make generic libraries possible such as the C++
    Standard Library that C++ developers use all the time. Whether you’re writing
    templates yourself or just using templates written by others (such as standard
    containers or algorithms), templates are most likely part of your daily code.

- en: This book is intended to provide a good understanding of all the spectrum of
    templates available in C++ (from their basic syntax to concepts in C++20). This
    will be the focus of the first two parts of the book. The third and final part
    will help you put the newly acquired knowledge into practice to perform metaprogramming
    with templates.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for beginner-to-intermediate C++ developers who want to learn about
    template metaprogramming as well as advanced C++ developers looking to get up
    to speed with the new C++20 features related to templates and the various idioms
    and patterns. Basic C++ coding experience is necessary to get started with this
    book.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B18367_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015), *Introduction to Templates*,
    provides an introduction to the concept of template metaprogramming in C++, with
    several simple examples, and a discussion on why we need templates and what are
    the pros and cons of using templates.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B18367_02_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor024), *Template Fundamentals*,
    explores all forms of templates in C++: function templates, class templates, variable
    templates, and alias templates. For each of these, we discuss the syntax and the
    details of how they work. Furthermore, the key concepts of template instantiation
    and specialization are addressed here.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B18367_03_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor051), *Variadic Templates*,
    is dedicated entirely to variadic templates which are templates that have a variable
    number of template parameters. We discuss in detail variadic function templates,
    variadic class templates, variadic alias templates, and variadic variable templates,
    parameter packs and how they are expanded, as well as fold expressions that help
    us simplify the writing of variadic templates.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B18367_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor064), *Advanced Template Concepts*,
    groups a series of advanced template concepts such as dependent names and name
    lookup, template argument deduction, template recursion, perfect forwarding, generic
    and template lambdas. By understanding these topics, readers will be able to greatly
    expand the variety of templates they can read or write.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B18367_05_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor080), *Type Traits and Conditional
    Compilation*, is dedicated to type traits. The reader will learn about type traits,
    what traits the standard library provides, and how they can be used to solve different
    problems.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B18367_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor099), *Concepts and Constraints*,
    presents the new C++20 mechanism for defining requirements for template arguments
    with concepts and constraints. You will learn about the various ways to specify
    constraints. Moreover, we provide an overview of the content of the C++20 standard
    concepts library.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 7*](B18367_07_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor123), *Patterns and Idioms*,
    explores a series of unrelated advanced topics of using the knowledge learned
    so far into implementing various patterns. We explore the concepts of static polymorphism,
    type erasure, tag dispatching, and patterns such as the curiously recursive template
    pattern, expression templates, mixins, and typelists.'

    is dedicated to understanding containers, iterators, and algorithms, which are
    the core components of the standard template library. You will learn here how
    to write a generic container and an iterator type for it as well as a general-purpose
    algorithm.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 9*](B18367_09_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor188), *The Ranges Library*,
    explores the new C++20 Ranges library with its key features such as ranges, range
    adaptors, and constrained algorithms. These enable us to write simpler code for
    working with ranges. Furthermore, you will also learn here how to write your own
    range adaptor.'

- en: To get started with this book, you need to have some basic knowledge of the
    C++ programming language. You need to know the syntax and fundamentals about classes,
    functions, operators, function overloading, inheritance, virtual functions, and
    more. However, no knowledge of templates is required, as this book will teach
    you everything from scratch.

    any compiler to build and run them. However, although many snippets work with
    a C++11 compiler, there are also snippets that require a C++17 or C++20 compliant
    compiler. Therefore, we recommend you use a compiler version that supports C++20
    so you can run all the samples. The samples in this book have been tested with
    **MSVC 19.30** (**Visual Studio 2022**), **GCC 12.1/13**, and **Clang 13/14**.
    If you don’t have such a C++20 compliant compiler on your machine, you can try
    one online. We recommend one of the following:'
