     Preface
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     Asynchronous programming is an essential practice for building efficient, responsive, and high-performance software, particularly in today’s world of multi-core processors and real-time data processing.
    
    
     This book dives deep into the principles and practical techniques for mastering asynchronous programming in C++, equipping you with the knowledge needed to handle everything from thread management to
    
    
     
      performance optimization.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     There are several key pillars to developing
    
    
     
      asynchronous software:
     
    
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     
      Thread management and synchronization
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Asynchronous programming concepts, models, and libraries
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Debugging, testing, and optimizing multithreaded and asynchronous software
     
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    
     While many resources focus on the basics of parallel programming or generic software development, this book is designed to offer a comprehensive exploration of these pillars.
    
    
     It covers the essential techniques for managing concurrency, debugging complex systems, and optimizing software performance, all while grounding these concepts in
    
    
     
      real-world scenarios.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     We will guide you through various aspects of asynchronous programming with practical examples based on
    
    
     
      the following:
     
    
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     
      Our extensive experience developing high-performance software
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Best practices learned from working across diverse industries, from finance to research centers
     
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    
     As multi-core processors and parallel computing architectures become increasingly integral to modern applications, the demand for asynchronous programming expertise is growing rapidly.
    
    
     Mastering the techniques covered in this book will help you not only tackle today’s complex software development challenges but also prepare for future advancements in
    
    
     
      performance-critical software.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Whether you’re working with low-latency financial systems, developing high-throughput applications, or simply looking to improve your programming skills, this book will provide you with the tools and knowledge
    
    
     
      to succeed.

     To get the most out of this book
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     You will need to have previous experience with programming using C++ and how to use debuggers to find bugs.
    
    
     As we are using C++20 features, and in some examples C++23, you will need to install GCC 14 and Clang 18.
    
    
     All source code examples have been tested in Ubuntu and macOS, but as they are platform-independent, they should compile and run on
    
    
     
      any platform.

     Part 1:Foundations of Parallel Programming and  Process Management
    
   </h1>
  </div>
  <div><p>
    
     In this part, we delve into the fundamental concepts and paradigms that form the foundation of parallel programming and process management.
    
    
     You will gain a deep understanding of the architectures used to build parallel systems and explore the various programming paradigms available for developing efficient parallel, multithreading, and asynchronous software.
    
    
     Additionally, we will cover critical concepts related to processes, threads, and services, highlighting their importance in operating systems, especially in the context of process life cycle, performance, and
    
    
     
      resource management.
