<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 14.1 – The Arduino IoT Cloud plans’ different categories</p>
<p>The Arduino IoT Cloud <a id="_idIndexMarker1081"/>team divided the pricing plans according to different categories and users, and pricing varies from category to category. There are also different pricing plans available in those categories. For the updated pricing plans and features, visit <a href="https://cloud.arduino.cc/plans/">https://cloud.arduino.cc/plans/</a>.</p>
<p>We will discuss all the categories step by step in the following subsections, and the business plan will be discussed in a separate section. Firstly, we will look at plans for individuals in the next subsection.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-299"><a id="_idTextAnchor299"/>Plans for individuals</h2>
<p>First, we<a id="_idIndexMarker1082"/> will start with pricing plans for individuals. This category is specially designed for learners, professionals, makers, hobbyists, or anyone who wants to learn or use the Arduino IoT Cloud as an individual entity. For them, the Arduino IoT Cloud has four different plans, which include the free, entry, maker, and maker plus plans. All the plans have different pricing according to their features, except for the free plan, which is freely available to everyone without any cost.</p>
<p>Now, we will discuss how each plan is different from another by comparing their limitations and features, as well as their cost, in <em class="italic">Table 4.1</em>. We will not compare all the features here, as the complete details are available on the Arduino IoT Cloud plans page. Here, we will only discuss the important features.</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 14.1 – The plan for individuals’ features comparison</p>
<p>In <em class="italic">Table 14.1</em>, we<a id="_idIndexMarker1083"/> compare different plans with respect to some important features. Firstly, we will explore the <em class="italic">free plan</em>, which only allows you to create two Things. One-day data retention is available, and you can create up to five cloud variables for your Thing. However, cloud triggers, API access, a shareable dashboard, and (<strong class="bold">OTA</strong>) features are not available. The free plan is good from a learning point of view, and you can even host up to two personal IoT devices.</p>
<p>Then, we have the <em class="italic">entry plan</em>, which is perfect for students and hobbyists if they want to expand their IoT devices on a smaller scale. This plan will cost them USD 23.88 per year and is only available in yearly billing, not monthly. In this plan, you will get 10 Things and 15-day data retention, with up to 10 cloud variables for each Thing. Users will also get the benefit of the API and OTA features, but cloud triggers and shareable dashboard features are still not available.</p>
<p>The <em class="italic">maker plan</em> is the <a id="_idIndexMarker1084"/>third plan in this category, which is good for users who design and develop IoT solutions and want to taste all the features of the Arduino IoT Cloud. It costs USD 71.88 per year and can be paid on a monthly basis. With this plan, users are able to create 25 Things, and 90-day data retention is allowed (which is a very good option for data recording). Also, users are allowed to set up cloud triggers for 100 notifications per day, and 10 API requests per second are allowed.</p>
<p>Finally, we have the <em class="italic">maker plus plan</em>, which is the perfect choice for IoT freelancers or small-scale IoT start-ups. In this plan, users are allowed to host up to 100 Things with one-year data retention, which is a perfectly good combination for professional, small-scale deployments, and they only need to pay USD 239.98 per year or USD 23.99 per month. You can see all the features of the Maker Plus plan, as well as the aforementioned plans, in <em class="italic">Table 4.1</em> or on the official website.</p>
<p><em class="italic">Machine learning tools</em> are available to all plans equally, so anyone can enjoy the benefit of this feature and integrate machine learning into their IoT solutions, making them more advanced. This offers the benefit of powerful machine learning on the cloud side without any hassle.</p>
<p>Let’s explore the maker plus plan with respect to its cost for freelancers and small IoT start-ups. This plan costs USD 239.98 per year and allows you to host up to 100 IoT Things. If we calculate the cost per Thing, then it will be around USD 2.40 per Thing for one year, which is very reasonably priced, and there is also zero cost for infrastructure and security maintenance, as all these requirements are managed by the Arduino IoT Cloud team.</p>
<p>In this subsection, we discussed the different Arduino Cloud plans that are available for individuals in detail. In the upcoming subsection, we will explore the plans for educational institutes.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-300"><a id="_idTextAnchor300"/>Plans for schools</h2>
<p>Every <a id="_idIndexMarker1085"/>organization, such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon AWS, provides a special pricing plan for education institutes to help them grow their students’ knowledge and skills, preparing them according to the latest industry trends. The Arduino IoT Cloud also has a special pricing plan for schools, colleges, and universities.</p>
<p>Besides their special pricing plan, the Arduino IoT Cloud also provides a free plan for students, similar to the free plan for individuals. Therefore, we will not discuss this and focus instead on the customized school plan. In the school plan category, the pricing changes according to the number of students, but the features available to them all remain the same. <em class="italic">Table 14.2</em> provides a detailed pricing plan according to the number of students. For updated pricing for schools, visit <a href="https://cloud.arduino.cc/plans">https://cloud.arduino.cc/plans</a>.</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 14.2 – The pricing plan for schools according to the number of students</p>
<p><em class="italic">Table 14.2</em> states the pricing according to student numbers and per member. Let’s explore what features they provide to every school member. In the school plan, every member can create up to 5 Things, with unlimited cloud variables and six-month data retention, which is very good, especially for PhD and master’s students, as they may want to collect data from IoT devices for further research and experiments, or are building a prototype to solve a real-world problem. Also, the plan provides 10 notifications per day for cloud triggers and 10 requests per second for APIs.</p>
<p>The Arduino IoT Cloud school plan can also natively integrate with Google Classroom users. This makes it easy for faculty members to manage their students, assignments, and lots of other stuff in the Arduino IoT Cloud via Google Classroom. The Arduino IoT Cloud also provides centralized billing and user management that is <strong class="bold">General Data Protection </strong><strong class="bold">Regulation</strong> (<strong class="bold">GDPR</strong>)-compliant.</p>
<p>There is another offer available to students via <strong class="bold">GitHub Education</strong> – the <strong class="bold">Student Developer Pack</strong>. Students can visit the official GitHub page for further updates and news: <a href="https://education.github.com/pack#offers">https://education.github.com/pack#offers</a>. According to the current agreement between<a id="_idIndexMarker1086"/> Arduino and GitHub, Arduino provides six free months of the Arduino IoT Cloud maker plan, as well as a discount on selected development boards.</p>
<p>In this subsection, we dived deep into educational pricing plans and their features for each student. In the following section, we will explore the Enterprise Base Plan in detail, which helps you to scale your product with enterprise-level features.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-301"><a id="_idTextAnchor301"/>The enterprise base plan</h2>
<p>In this<a id="_idIndexMarker1087"/> section, we will first explore the basic features of the enterprise base plan, and then in different subsections, we will explore the specialized features that are only available in the enterprise plan, which allow organizations to perform bulk operations such as fleet and device management.</p>
<p>The enterprise base plan is specially designed for organizations that are interested in using the Arduino IoT Cloud as a main infrastructure for their solution deployment and management. In regard to pricing and devices, the plan starts from USD 42 for 50 devices, increasing in multiples of 50 up to 500. If you have more than 500 devices, then you would need to directly contact the Arduino Support team for a customized pricing plan. Fifty devices cost USD 500 per year, and each device costs USD 10 per year and approximately USD 0.83 per month. This cost per device is very nominal, as you don’t need to pay any infrastructure or development charges, security costs, and so on. This plan also provides you with advanced management control, which will make your management and operations easier compared to other plans.</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Data retention</strong> in the enterprise plan is one year for all devices, and every device is allowed to send 20 notifications via <strong class="bold">cloud triggers</strong> and 10 requests per second for <strong class="bold">APIs</strong>. Besides all of these features, organizations will receive <strong class="bold">technical support</strong> via a ticketing system, which is not available in other plans.</p>
<p>In this subsection, we discussed the basic features of the enterprise base plan. Now, we will explore role-based access control and fleet management in the upcoming subsection.</p>
<h3>Role-based access control and fleet management</h3>
<p>At the enterprise level, there are several employees in an organization who manage and perform different operations. It’s mandatory for an organization to assign different access levels to their employees according to their responsibilities. To aid this, the Arduino IoT Cloud has a role-based access control system for organizations, where they can easily assign their employees access and manage it according to their job description.</p>
<p>Role-based access control ensures the safety and security of your devices and protects them from human mistakes and errors. With the help of role-based access control, you can share access among teams for project collaboration <a id="_idIndexMarker1088"/>and assign device access to members at different levels, according to their management responsibility.</p>
<p>Another feature of the Arduino IoT Cloud enterprise base plan is fleet management. The Arduino IoT Cloud introduced this feature to manage a large number of devices effectively and easily. Fleet management contains a device filtering and grouping feature, bulk OTA updates, hierarchies, and many other features.</p>
<p>In this subsection, we discussed role-based access control and fleet management for devices. In the following subsection, we will explore machine learning tools and the Portenta X8 Manager.</p>
<h3>Machine learning tools and the Portenta X8 Manager</h3>
<p>With the rapid growth of AI and machine learning, it’s now become vital for IoT solutions to integrate machine learning into their solutions so that customers can benefit from its power to improve their operations, such as predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and quality control.</p>
<p>The Arduino team collaborated with Edge Impulse to provide machine learning integration in the Arduino IoT Cloud. In Edge Impulse, you can train models using devices’ data, by importing them into Edge Impulse or directly connecting the devices, such as Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, Arduino Nicla Vision, Arduino Portenta H7, or any Linux-supported device. This feature helps developers and solution providers to train a model using a graphical user interface, with the help of a small amount of code.</p>
<p>Then, you can deploy these models, using TinyML, to <a id="_idIndexMarker1089"/>Arduino-supported development boards. For further details, please visit <a href="https://cloud.arduino.cc/machine-learning-tools/">https://cloud.arduino.cc/machine-learning-tools/</a>. In the enterprise base plan, Arduino charges USD 500 per month for machine learning services, which include 60 minutes per job and a total of 1,000 minutes per month.</p>
<p>The Portenta X8 Manager is a specialized extension integrated with the Arduino IoT Cloud, designed to empower users in safeguarding and managing their Portenta X8 Linux distribution. It facilitates essential functionalities such as <strong class="bold">secure maintenance</strong>, <strong class="bold">containerized application deployment</strong>, and secure <strong class="bold">OTA</strong> differential updates.</p>
<p>The Portenta X8 Manager is designed for businesses and organizations that need to deploy and manage large fleets of Portenta X8 devices securely and reliably. It provides a number of features that make it ideal for enterprise use, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Secure OTA updates</strong>: The Portenta X8 Manager uses a secure OTA update process to ensure that devices are always up to date with the latest firmware and security patches.</li>

<h3>The Speech Recognition Engine library</h3>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Arduino Speech Recognition Engine</strong> is a powerful software library that enables you to<a id="_idIndexMarker1127"/> develop projects <a id="_idIndexMarker1128"/>based on speech recognition. It allows you to interact with machines using voice commands, without the need for vocal training or an internet connection. The library was developed by Cyberon, a worldwide leader in speech recognition, and is designed to be easy to use and compatible with multiple Arduino boards and the Arduino IDE. It supports voice commands in over 40 languages, regardless of the speaker’s voice, tone, or accent. You can configure multiple wake-up words and sequences without retraining for different users.</p>
<p>The Speech Recognition Engine is ideal for various applications, such as smart buildings and home automation, information kiosks, vending machines, smart beds in hospitals, and emergency alert systems. It can listen to anyone speaking to it while ignoring background noise.</p>
<p>To get started <a id="_idIndexMarker1129"/>with the Arduino Speech Recognition Engine, you can visit the official Arduino website: <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/pro/software-speech-recognition-engine/">https://www.arduino.cc/pro/software-speech-recognition-engine/</a>. It offers a robust library featuring an integrated AI/ML engine that excels in phoneme-based modeling. This advanced library enables the recognition of multiple wake-up words and sequences of commands without the need for vocal training. The library is compatible with multiple Arduino boards and requires no additional hardware, software, or internet connectivity.</p>
<p>Note that there is also another Arduino board called Nicla Voice, which was discussed in the <em class="italic">Arduino PRO hardware</em> section. This board implements always-on speech and motion recognition at the edge. It integrates a neural decision processor from Syntiant (NDP120) to run multiple AI algorithms.</p>
