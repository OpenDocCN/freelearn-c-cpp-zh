- en: '**Unreal Engine 4** (**UE4**) is a complete suite of game development tools
    made by game developers, for game developers. With more than 100 practical recipes,
    this book is a guide showcasing techniques to unlock the power of C++ scripting
    while developing games with UE 4.21\. This book starts off by showing how to add
    and edit C++ classes from within the Unreal Editor. It will delve into one of
    Unreal''s primary strengths: the ability for designers to customize programmer-developed
    actors and components. It will help you understand the benefits of using C++ in
    conjunction with the many tools included with this powerful game engine. With
    a blend of task-oriented recipes, this book will provide actionable information
    about writing code for games with UE4 and manipulating the game and the development
    environment using C++. Toward the end of the book, you will be empowered to become
    a top-notch developer with Unreal Engine 4 using C++ as the scripting language!'
