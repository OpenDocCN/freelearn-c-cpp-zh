			<h2 id="_idParaDest-205"><a id="_idTextAnchor218"/>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Unless I've completely failed at writing convincingly for the last hundred-and-something pages, you should have the impression that software is a social activity. We work with other people to produce software, and the value system that we share as makers of software shapes the software we make. We give (or sell) our software to other people to use, and that shapes the way they see themselves and work with each other. Software can reinforce existing bonds or create new ones, but it can also destroy or reduce the importance of existing connections. Professionally speaking, the bonds our software has influence over that are closest to our experiences when writing code are with the team that we interact with every day.</p>
			<p>This chapter discusses these bonds: how we work as a team, how our colleagues work with us, and the benefits and tensions that can occur.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-206"><a id="_idTextAnchor219"/>Focus versus Interruption</h2>
			<p>We've heard the clarion call. We've heard how programmers need to get <em class="italics">in the zone</em>—<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000068.html">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000068.html</a> in order to get their best work done, and that it's hard to enter the zone. We've heard that a simple phone call or chat from a friend is all it takes to exit the zone, but that getting back in can take 15 minutes. So why doesn't everyone work from home? If having other humans around is so poisonous to productivity, why does <em class="italics">any</em> business even bother with the capital expenditure of an office?</p>
			<p>Because, while a good person works well on their own, two people working together can be <em class="italics">awesome</em>. Let me describe the day I had prior to writing this paragraph. I didn't really get much done in the morning, because a colleague asked me about memory leaks in the code he was working on and I helped him with that. This solved his problem much faster than he would've solved it on his own.</p>
			<p>So, I only really got about an hour of time "in the zone" before lunch, and it didn't go so well. I made a bit of progress on my problem, but then hit a problem where a simple change to add new behavior broke the stuff that already existed. I couldn't work out why that was. Anyway, it was then lunchtime, so we went to get a sandwich and I described the problem to my colleague. Before we got to the sandwich shop, we'd already agreed what the problem was and what I should do to solve it, which worked first time when I got back to my desk.</p>
			<p>The point of this anecdote is that, had we both been left "in the zone," we could undoubtedly have worked faster: up to the point where we could not individually solve our problems. We would've more efficiently failed at our jobs. As it was, having the possibility to work together let us pool our knowledge, even though it meant each of us getting taken out of "the zone" at some point.</p>
			<p>I've worked in various environments. In my first job, I had an office to myself—albeit one where one of the walls was the lift shaft and the whole shebang was underground. (In fact, this office had previously been the bunk room for on-site <strong class="bold">Digital Equipment Corporation </strong>engineers maintaining the computer that came a few before the systems I was responsible for. Either they were very heavy sleepers, or they turned the lifts off during the night shifts.) Since then, I've worked in cubicle spaces, open-plan spaces, and in my house. I know what it's like to be "in the zone": but I also know what it's like to be banging your head up against a wall when you can't solve a problem and have no one to ask about it. I know what it's like to work for 10 hours straight on a really interesting problem, and what it's like to be told after 5 minutes that the company already has a solution you could use. I know what it's like when the guitars over in the corner are beckoning, and what it's like to feed off the energy of a handful of other engrossed and motivated people sat nearby.</p>
			<p>The fact is that "the zone" is not always relevant, as the case example above shows. You may want to enter "the zone" to do some research from books or the internet, but then it'd probably be helpful to get some input from other people to compare their experiences and opinions with what you learned. "The zone" is helpful while you're coding, but only if you know or can work out what you're supposed to be doing. If the problem is at all difficult, talking it over with other people will be more helpful.</p>
			<p>A final point here: humans are <em class="italics">"an intensely social species"</em>—<a href="https://thoughteconomics.com/">https://thoughteconomics.com/</a> and the best environments for entering "the zone"—working from home or in a secluded area—are the worst for having shared social experiences with our colleagues. Some of us are lucky enough to be able to fill our social requirements with interactions among friends or family outside of work, but for more extroverted people who prize continual social contact, working in solitude can have a negative impact on mental health.</p>
			<p>So, working alone in conditions conducive to solitary work is sometimes useful but can be emotionally unstimulating. Working with other people can be rewarding and beneficial, but also distracting and frustrating. How do we balance these two aspects? An approach that's commonly employed is the "headphones rule." Headphones on: I'm concentrating. Headphones off: feel free to talk to me. A variant of the headphones rule is the <strong class="bold">duck of productivity</strong>—<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBw_cKdnUgw&amp;index=11&amp;list=PLKMpKKmHd2SvY9DLg_Lozb06M2MLcNImz&amp;t=38s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBw_cKdnUgw&amp;index=11&amp;list=PLKMpKKmHd2SvY9DLg_Lozb06M2MLcNImz&amp;t=38s</a>).</p>
			<p>In my experience, enforcing the headphones or duck of productivity rule is difficult: people on both sides of the headphones feel it's rude to ignore friends and colleagues regardless of headphone status. Changing the social rules of the whole team can be hard. One group I worked in came up with a much simpler rule that's easier to work with: if I'm in the office, then I'm here to talk to everyone else and get some collaboration done. If I'm anywhere else (the canteen, a meeting room, at home, a coffee shop nearby), then I'm getting work done on my own.</p>
			<p>Where the balance needs to be drawn varies based on the individual; therefore, the optimum approach for a team to take depends on the people who comprise the team. More gregarious people will want to spend more time working with others, so having a policy where people who want to work uninterrupted stay at home will isolate them.</p>
			<p>One of the more general zone-related techniques I've come across is based on very lightweight time tracking. This calls for a kitchen timer (or an app – or, if you're in a hotel and enjoy annoying receptionists, wake-up calls) to be set for 25 minutes. During those 25 minutes, focus on your problem. If someone wants help, ask if you can get back to them after the time's up. At the end of those 25 minutes, take a short break, answer any interruptions that came up, and plan to enter the next 25 minutes. If you absolutely need to work on something else, it's suggested that you abort (rather than pause) the work period and start again when the opportunity arises.</p>
			<p>An important observation regarding this technique is that it's OK to not be in a timed stretch if you're taking a break or helping someone else: both important parts of your working day. You might only manage one or two 25-minute bursts on some days, but at least you get to control the trade-off between "the zone" and all the other things you have to do.</p>
			<p>I've only used this technique for a short while, but I've found that it does help to improve focus. Initially, I was surprised by how long a 25-minute stretch can seem to last! As I write that, it seems absurd, but it shows how much I was allowing distractions such as social networks to get in the way of my focus.</p>
			<p>Remaining focused even for as long as 25 minutes needs support from both your environment (the subject of the next section) and your tools. One iPad app that I worked on could only be tested on tethered iPads, as a third-party library was not supplied for the simulator. It took about 30 seconds to "<em class="italics">Build and Run</em>" or to launch any unit tests – plenty of time for me to be distracted by email or Twitter. I also found that my ability to stay disciplined tails off after lunch; I still get work done, but I'm much more likely to carry on working into the breaks or stop in the middle of a stretch.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-207"><a id="_idTextAnchor220"/>Working Environment</h2>
			<p>Your interactions with your colleagues are a small portion of the collection of experiences and inputs that make up your entire working environment. Unsurprisingly, the best environment is no less personal than the best trade-off between solitary and team working; the best I can do here is describe what's worked for me and some of the things you could consider to reflect on your own environment.</p>
			<p>Firstly, if you're working somewhere that expects a "standard" desk layout with no decoration or personalization, that's just not a very healthy environment at all. People like to decorate their environments <em class="italics">to express their individuality</em>—<a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/academics/communication">https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/academics/communication</a>. A homogeneous workspace may be good for ensuring the facilities manager's magnolia paint does not get stained but does not allow employees any creative freedom. Constraining the creativity of our software makers is not good for making creative software.</p>
			<p>The 1999 edition of Peopleware—<a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Peopleware.html?id=eA9PAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Peopleware.html?id=eA9PAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y</a> has a lot to say about working conditions. I arrived into working life too late to see the full-height cubicle farms they complain about (though I have, of course, seen <em class="italics">Tron and Office Space</em>), but other aspects of their discussion of office setups are still relevant.</p>
			<p>A couple of places I've worked in have had those huge <strong class="bold">Voice-over-IP</strong> desk phones with all the buttons, redirect options, switches, and so-on that the conn in <strong class="bold">Star Trek</strong> first introduced to human-machine interaction. An early discovery of mine was that no one knows how to operate those phones, which means that you have plausible deniability for any of your actions, should you need it. Find the manual online and locate the one mute/divert button you need, then work peacefully. When someone complains that they were trying to phone you:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Apologize for having hit the wrong button when you were trying to divert calls to your mobile phone.</li>
				<li>Suggest that email or some other asynchronous communication is a better way to reach you.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Two important features of work environments for me are bookshelves and whiteboards. Even when I work from home, I have a whiteboard and marker to hand for quick diagramming – quite a small one that I can hold up to the Skype camera if I need to. <em class="italics">Not</em> having a whiteboard can have a deleterious effect on the rest of the workspace. One office I worked in only had whiteboards in the meeting rooms, so we grabbed dry markers and drew diagrams all over the (cheap, white, fibreboard) bookshelves. We soon found that the ink was really hard to clean off; but having ruined the bookshelves there was no reason to look back. Diagrams quickly became palimpsests as new "art" was drawn over the older stuff that couldn't be erased.</p>
			<p>I mentioned earlier that my first office was underground. A literature review of the <em class="italics">effects of natural light on building occupants</em>—<a href="http://indoorenvironment.org/effects-of-natural-light-on-building-occupants/">http://indoorenvironment.org/effects-of-natural-light-on-building-occupants/</a> found that people feel better and, as a result, perform better in environments with natural lighting. This result doesn't just apply to workers; students and even shoppers are affected. As DeMarco and Lister observe, there's no excuse for building a work environment where some people don't have access to a window. People who think it's impossible to give everyone a window need to look at the way hotels are designed.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-208"><a id="_idTextAnchor221"/>Prioritizing Work</h2>
			<p>Most people who make software will have more than one thing they are working on at any time. The choice could be between different tasks on one project, tasks on different projects, and other work such as preparing presentations, responding to emails, and so on.</p>
			<p>Some people like to capture all of these tasks in a big review system such as <strong class="bold">GTD</strong> (<a href="http://www.davidco.com/">http://www.davidco.com/</a>) so that, at any time, they can review the outstanding tasks in their current context and choose one to work on next. A much simpler approach I was taught by the human resources department at <strong class="bold">Sophos</strong> (<a href="http://www.sophos.com">http://www.sophos.com</a>), who got it from President Eisenhower, was to draw four quadrants indicating the urgency and importance of tasks.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer056">
					<img alt="Figure 13.1: The Eisenhower Matrix&#13;&#10;" src="image/B15099_13_01.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h6>Figure 13.1: The Eisenhower Matrix</h6>
			<p>Now think about the tasks that are currently pending and put them into these quadrants. Anything in the top-right quadrant is both important and urgent, so probably needs to be done soon. Anything that's important but not urgent doesn't need to be done <em class="italics">yet</em>, and anything that's urgent but not important doesn't need to be done <em class="italics">at all</em> – or at least not by you.</p>
			<p>A large amount of a programmer's work is prioritized by other agents anyway, which means that, much of the time, it's clear what you should be working on next. Later in this chapter, we'll examine some software development methodologies designed to allow the whole team to decide what they're working on. (In one of my rare rages against the establishment, I'm going to call them "patterns for software project management" rather than "methodologies." The latter word is used—alongside "paradigm"—in so many contexts as to be ambiguous. I saw Barbara Liskov give a talk reflecting on her work on data types where she used "methodology" to mean an overall software design approach: so object-oriented, structured, procedural, and so on are all "methodologies" at the same time that Waterfall, Scrum, and so on are.) </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor222"/>Tell Experts What Needs to Be Done</h2>
			<p>In other words, don't tell experts what to do. The more cynical of them will do what you tell them. That doesn't sound so bad, until you realize that <em class="italics">they</em> are the expert and are doing it out of spite. Neal Stephenson expanded upon this idea in his novel <strong class="bold">Cryptonomicon</strong>—<a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Cryptonomicon.html?id=Lw-00wTgBy8C&amp;redir_esc=y">https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Cryptonomicon.html?id=Lw-00wTgBy8C&amp;redir_esc=y</a>:</p>
			<p><em class="italics">The extreme formality with which he addresses these officers carries an important subtext: your problem, sir, is deciding what you want me to do, and my problem, sir, is doing it. My gung-ho posture says that once you give the order I'm not going to bother you with any of the details—and your half of the bargain is you had better stay on your side of the line, sir, and not bother me with any of the chickenshit politics that you have to deal with for a living. The implied responsibility placed upon the officer's shoulders by the subordinate's unhesitating willingness to follow orders is a withering burden to any officer with half a brain, and Shaftoe has more than once seen seasoned noncoms reduce green lieutenants to quivering blobs simply by standing before them and agreeing, cheerfully, to carry out their orders.</em></p>
			<p>And it's not just fictional military figures who talk about this. General George S. Patton:</p>
			<p><em class="italics">Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do, and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.</em></p>
			<p>There are two sides to this. One is that the other person probably knows more about what you're asking than you do: OK, so you're a great programmer, but when it comes to graphic design, user interaction, documentation, translation, marketing, or any of the other things that go into building software, there are likely to be people out there who can handle it better than you. Your best option is to find one of them, outline the goal, and leave them to it.</p>
			<p>The other issue to be aware of is that leaving someone else to it is a <em class="italics">lot</em> easier than taking control, because there's a lot less work involved. Once you get into the officer-marine relationship described in <em class="italics">Cryptonomicon</em>, you have to give <em class="italics">every</em> order because it becomes an expected part of the interaction that you <em class="italics">will</em> give every order. It's a lot quicker, and you get better results, to just say "this is the problem that needs solving" and let someone who's good at solving that problem assume responsibility.</p>
			<p>So, the central trick to delegation is relinquishing control of the delegated task. That means the fundamental thing to learn is <em class="italics">trust</em>; not so much trusting the other person not to have messed it up but trusting yourself to have found the person who won't mess it up and to have communicated the problem to them clearly.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor223"/>Working with Junior Programmers</h2>
			<p>Less-experienced programmers are just a special case of experts – they're experts-in-training. The above rules about dealing with experts apply, so let them know what needs doing, make sure you did that clearly, and let them get on with it.</p>
			<p>The clarification aspect is the part that needs the most examination. Remembering <em class="italics">Chapter 10, Learning</em>, you'll find that different people learn in different ways. Some approach a new problem via experimentation, some by reading about concepts. <em class="italics">Diagrams help a lot of learners</em>. In my experience working as the senior developer on a team, it's important not to accidentally invert the expert-customer relationship, because then you get back into a micromanagement situation. Let the junior ask questions; indeed, encourage them to ask questions, but act as an oracle and not as a lecturer.</p>
			<p>Having made yourself available while they're working, have a little retrospective when they've done the task. Try to avoid "I wouldn't have done it like that"—that's just an offensive statement of the obvious. No matter how experienced or skilled the other person is, you would've done it differently. The key question is not whether they've done <em class="italics">your</em> work but whether they've done <em class="italics">good</em> work. Find the things that work and call them out. Ask why the junior did them like that and reinforce those decisions. Find the things that don't work, ask why they did them like that, and discuss the issues. Focus on the <em class="italics">issues</em>; don't talk about the <em class="italics">quality of the work</em> (or the integrity of the worker). Your role as a teacher is to help the learner to build a generalized mental model of what they want to do.</p>
			<p><em class="italics">A little aside on the subject of different ways of learning: I once found that body language gives you some great clues about how people think about their problems. I was working with a junior programmer and felt that I was not communicating very well. This programmer would solve the problems I posed, but often with some details missed out or not in the way I (thought I) had described.</em></p>
			<p><em class="italics">Then, in one discussion, it struck me. When I'm describing a software system, I describe it spatially: my hands make boxes and circle shapes and I move these shapes around as messages or data flowing through the software. When the other programmer described them, his hands stayed flat and moved from top to bottom as he explained the steps. I was drawing diagrams; he was listening for lists! I switched to explaining problems by listing the features and found that details stopped disappearing between the two of us.</em></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor224"/>Working with Managers</h2>
			<p>There are two (almost opposing) interpretations of the word "manager" as it applies to the work context. The conservative view is of the manager as the controlling force in charge of a group of people. This manager's position is seen as ensuring that their reports do the work expected by the business, and by extension, don't do anything unexpected.</p>
			<p>The liberal view is the manager as leader or enabler. This manager's role is to ensure that their reports have the resources they need to get their work done, free from distractions that the rest of the business (or its customers and suppliers, and so on) might impose.</p>
			<p>In this section, I'm going to leave the political models aside and discuss the general idea of working with the person you have to report to. If you're a self-employed programmer, you don't have an <em class="italics">explicit</em> manager. You may still find, from time to time, that certain people fill similar roles; I know some independent developers who contract "business mentors" to act in a coaching and advisory capacity. In some cases, the social structure in which you work as a consultant or contractor may see you reporting to a specific person in the business you're supplying to. "Manager" will do as shorthand for all of these people.</p>
			<p>Take a look back over what I've said about working with experts: you should tell them <em class="italics">what</em> needs doing, not <em class="italics">how</em> to do it. You should expect your manager to know and understand this, and in return, of course, you should act like the professional expert that you are. Really, the manager's task is as an <em class="italics">adaptor</em>. In one direction, they're taking the business goals and strategies and adapting them into <em class="italics">tactics</em> – into things that can be done <em class="italics">now</em> to improve the strategic position. In the other direction, they're taking your problems and concerns and adapting them into things the business can do to alleviate or remove those problems.</p>
			<p>The best managers I've worked with seem like they could do the second part of that context-free. It's about <em class="italics">coaching</em>; not about taking on the hard parts of your work. By countering every question, we ask with a question of their own, they force us to introspect, to diagnose our own problems, to suggest, and to evaluate our own solutions. They don't remove our <em class="italics">responsibility</em> to tackle the problems ourselves, even if they do accept the responsibility (and the authority) for implementing the solutions at times.</p>
			<p>That appearance of context-free management may not be entirely realistic. In a questionnaire completed by about 80 developers, <em class="italics">Jeremy Leipzig</em>—<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.2646v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.2646v1</a> discovered that developers felt their relationship with their manager was easier if the manager came from a technical, rather than a business, background.</p>
			<p>My hypothesis is that this is a communication issue, and thus has an effect on the first part of management (adapting the business's needs into things we need to do). Every group has its specific language, its <em class="italics">argot</em> of jargon and slang terms. Computing is certainly no stranger to that (I imagine an Ubuntu forum and Mumsnet would react very differently to discussions about "zombie children," for example). It can be hard to see when you're immersed in it, but this language creates a social inequality: the in-crowd who understand the jargon and the out-crowd who don't. If your manager is not part of the in-crowd, it's possible that you both struggle for terms in which to explain things and identify them on some level as "not one of <em class="italics">us</em>."</p>
			<p>In <em class="italics">Chapter 9, Requirements Engineering</em>, I identified how the use of a ubiquitous language can help everyone to understand how the software you're writing solves the problems that the customers need it to. Now, we find that a ubiquitous language has <em class="italics">political</em> benefits, too: it makes you all part of the same team. (One company I worked in managed to create silos of employees by devising a project code name. Often, these are fun little names chosen to both describe the whole project in shorthand, and to give everyone a sense of belonging, like having a team name. In this instance, the company didn't provide a central glossary of what all the projects were named and what they did. This reinforced the feeling of "us and them" <em class="italics">inside</em> the company: you either were a member of the elite group who knew what "Merlot" meant or you were not.) Consider it your responsibility to find some linguistic common ground with your manager, even if you have a computer science background and they have an MBA. You'll find it easier to remember that you're both on the same team that way.</p>
			<p>A final thought on working with managers that's really about professional ethics: over the last few years, I've found that managers don't like hearing bad news. It's a whole lot worse though if they <em class="italics">don't</em> hear the bad news and discover it for themselves, later. Being honest and alerting people to things going wrong early leads to some awkward conversations, but ultimately, you'll be respected more than if you pretend everything's going well up until the moment of disaster. I shouldn't have let myself get into a position of experience on this one, but I have, so you don't have to.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-212"><a id="_idTextAnchor225"/>Patterns of Software Project Management</h2>
			<p>Over the last five decades, there have been numerous different ways to run a software project proposed and practiced. Over the last decade, I've been exposed to a few of them. Which will work for you depends on the team you're working with and the expectations of the people you're working for.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-213"><a id="_idTextAnchor226"/>Waterfall</h3>
			<p>My first experience of a "death march" was on a waterfall project. The product manager wrote a document explaining the requirements of the new product. These were prioritized using 1-3 (with 1 being "we'll probably finish these in time," and 2-3 taking up space on the page). Then, the lead developer wrote a functional specification, explaining what each of the controls in the product would be and how each of them would fulfil a requirement from the first document.</p>
			<p>Given the functional specification, the lead developer (not necessarily the same one as mentioned previously) would estimate how long it'd take to build, and the lead tester would estimate how long it'd take to test. Then, the ship date was the day after that work ended! Having built and tested the thing, documentation could write a manual, translation could translate the whole lot, then it'd be beta tested, and finally, marketing could write a new website and it would all get launched with beer and nibbles in the office atrium.</p>
			<p>I should stress that the death march was not a <em class="italics">result</em> of following the waterfall process. The death march was the result of an inexperienced team, poor communication and collaboration, and an unclear vision of what the business or the customers thought the product should be.</p>
			<p>The waterfall process did make it harder to <em class="italics">react</em> to these problems, though. Limited visibility in the usual running of the project meant that most people involved had an idealized view of how the project <em class="italics">should</em> be progressing and treated that as reality. They didn't have a view of how the project <em class="italics">was</em> progressing because that feedback was neither requested nor provided: come back when you're ready to enter the testing phase. The expensive change-control procedure, involving sign-off from senior managers who weren't involved with the usual running of the project, made it hard or even <em class="italics">undesirable</em> to react to eleventh-hour feedback. Unfortunately, the twelfth hour resembles the twelfth much more than it does the first.</p>
			<p>In <em class="italics">Test-Driven iOS Development</em> section in <em class="italics">Chapter 5, Coding Practices</em>, I tried to paint the waterfall as a historical quirk that doesn't hold any relevance for modern developers. This isn't really true. If you're doing contract or agency work, the customer will often have a mental model that goes something like:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">I tell you what app I want.</li>
				<li>You build the app.</li>
				<li>Maybe we have a phone call every week, so I know you're still alive. If you send me a prototype, I might suggest moving a button or changing a word.</li>
				<li>You put the app on the store.</li>
				<li>I retire to a cocaine-soaked mountain complex.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You can dispel that myth. In fact, you probably should: if you get more feedback from your client, they'll feel more engaged, and enjoy the process more. They'll also end up with the product they <em class="italics">wanted</em>, not the one they <em class="italics">asked for</em> months ago. And if you <em class="italics">ask</em> for feedback from the client, they'll give you <em class="italics">that</em> feedback instead of the stuff about the buttons and words.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-214"><a id="_idTextAnchor227"/>Scrum</h3>
			<p>I've seen multiple projects run in multiple ways all named "Scrum," which is why I call these things patterns rather than rules. Most have had the following in common:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Short iteration lengths with work planned only for the upcoming iteration</li>
				<li>Frequent feedback to the whole team on how work is progressing on the current iteration</li>
				<li>Acceptance or rejection of the previous iteration's work at the end</li>
				<li>Some form of retrospective on what to learn from the previous iteration</li>
			</ul>
			<p>None of these things is in itself contentious and looking at the problems identified with my waterfall project above, we can see the benefit of frequent feedback, measurement of quality, and particularly of learning from our mistakes as quickly as possible. But the implementation often leaves people scratching their heads or updating their CVs.</p>
			<p>Take the "frequent feedback" point as an example. This is often embodied in the stand-up meeting. Does everyone actually stand up? If someone's late, do we wait or proceed without them? How long is it going to take (my record being an hour and a half, in a team with 16 developers who obviously only took 5 minutes each)? Do I actually need to know everything that comes up in the meeting? Why are you asking every day whether I've finished the thing I told you would take a week? (Actually, this one's my fault. I don't think that estimates are worth anything if they represent more than half a day of work. If I think something's going to take more than that, then I probably don't know what's involved and should find out before you start relying on my guesses.) Are minutes taken? If I want clarification on something do I ask now or after we've disbanded?</p>
			<p>The thing is, despite these differences in approach, things tend to actually happen. Stuff gets done and you can see it getting done because you've got a feel for what everyone is doing. I tend to think of Scrum as the closest thing you'll get to <strong class="bold">Agile software development</strong>—<a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/">http://www.agilemanifesto.org/</a> in an organization that still wants close managerial oversight, though in most situations I've encountered it doesn't quite match <em class="italics">the principles</em>—<a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html</a>.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-215"><a id="_idTextAnchor228"/>Lean Software</h3>
			<p>Lean software isn't really a way to run a software project, so much as a description of a principle of organizing software projects with some Japanese words thrown in to help sell the MBA textbooks. Indeed, it's one of the 12 agile principles linked above:</p>
			<p><em class="italics">Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.</em></p>
			<p>That's really all that Lean is (plus the textbooks). Focus on doing the valuable thing (solving the customer's problem) and not on doing the invaluable things. Work out what you're doing that doesn't have value and stop doing it.</p>
			<p>Interestingly, and probably because we enjoy doing it, we sometimes forget that writing software <em class="italics">doesn't</em> have value. Yes, <em class="italics">having</em> software that has been written does, but actually writing it costs money. Maybe we should be focusing more on reusing software or even on finding the thing that already exists that our customers could be using instead of a new bespoke product. The community of people promoting the lean idea have created <em class="italics">five principles</em>—<a href="http://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/Principles.cfm">http://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/Principles.cfm</a>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify value to the customer</li>
				<li>Eliminate any steps in the business chain that aren't adding value</li>
				<li>Create a smooth flow of the remaining steps, ending in delivering value to the customer</li>
				<li>Each step should pull its valuable input as needed from the upstream step</li>
				<li>Iterate over the above</li>
			</ul>
			<p>So far, so reasonable, although I know that I (along with a lot of you, I imagine) think it sounds a bit too businessy-MBAey. Therein lies the danger. This collection of values is actually <em class="italics">at an appropriate level of abstraction</em>, and it's <em class="italics">us</em> who are thinking too much about what we <em class="italics">currently</em> do, rather than whether it's useful. If you try to recast the above in terms of writing code, you get something like:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify that writing code is valuable</li>
				<li>Eliminate the meetings and other things that stop us writing code</li>
				<li>Write a load of automation stuff so that code is automatically delivered to the next people in the chain</li>
				<li>Manage a <strong class="bold">Kanban board</strong>—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board</a></li>
				<li>Iterate over the above</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is useful for improving the efficiency of <em class="italics">writing code</em>, which will almost certainly make developers happier and incrementally improve processes. But it doesn't help identify whether the most valuable thing to do is to write code; in fact, it actively hinders that.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-216"><a id="_idTextAnchor229"/>Anchoring Bias and Project Management</h3>
			<p>A last thought on running a software project for this chapter. The previous section explained that if we think about a process too much in terms of what we already do, it becomes harder to question whether <em class="italics">that</em> is worth doing at all. It turns out there are other problems associated with thinking about things – not that I'm suggesting anyone should stop.</p>
			<p>There's a factor in decision-making called <strong class="bold">anchoring</strong>—<a href="http://www.skepdic.com/anchoring.html">http://www.skepdic.com/anchoring.html</a>, in which people tend to fixate on a piece of information presented early in making later judgements. Anchoring is the reason infomercials ask you "How much would <em class="italics">you</em> pay for this? $100?" before telling you the price is $10. You probably don't expect the price to be $100, but it's given you an <em class="italics">anchor</em> that will set your further expectations.</p>
			<p>Related to this is the <strong class="bold">social anchoring</strong>—<a href="http://dictionary-psychology.com/index.php?a=term&amp;d=Dictionary+of+psychology&amp;t=Social+anchoring">http://dictionary-psychology.com/index.php?a=term&amp;d=Dictionary+of+psychology&amp;t=Social+anchoring</a> factor. People are inclined to vote the same way as the herd. There's a great demonstration of this, devised by <strong class="bold">Solomon Asch (1951)</strong>—<a href="http://www.simplypsychology.org/asch-conformity.html">http://www.simplypsychology.org/asch-conformity.html</a>. Eight "participants" are asked which of three lines is the longest; the first seven are stooges who all choose the wrong answer. Asch found that only 25% of the (actual) participants never conformed to the group and gave the wrong answer.</p>
			<p>This is a genuine question, because I don't think it's been researched: what effect do these anchoring biases have on software projects, and what can we do to correct for them? Does giving people wireframes or other prototypes anchor their expectations and make them desire products that are like the prototypes? Do games like <em class="italics">Planning Poker</em> inadvertently anchor estimates to the number thought of by the first person to reveal? Might we accidentally bias estimates by discussing unrelated numbers in meetings ("I hope we can get this done in 45 minutes... Now, how many story points is this feature")?</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-217"><a id="_idTextAnchor230"/>Bias bias</h3>
			<p>An unfortunate phenomenon is the <strong class="bold">Bias Blind Spot</strong>—<a href="https://dataspace.princeton.edu/jspui/handle/88435/dsp013j333232r">https://dataspace.princeton.edu/jspui/handle/88435/dsp013j333232r</a>, in which we more readily report biases in another people's reasoning than in our own. A problem with drawing attention to cognitive biases such as the anchoring bias above is that, being aware of the bias, we're now in a position to identify <em class="italics">other people</em> relying on the bias, and to believe that <em class="italics">we</em> are immune from it because we know about it. This is not true. Being aware of it will not stop us from applying the bias: analyzing, detecting, and correcting for the bias in our own work and decisions will do that. There is <em class="italics">Chapter 11, Critical Analysis</em>, in this book.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-218"><a id="_idTextAnchor231"/>Negotiation</h2>
			<p>You need to negotiate with other people. OK, if you're selling a consumer app, you probably don't negotiate with your customers: you set a price and they either pay it or go elsewhere. But that doesn't mean negotiation is limited to people dealing with terrorists and kidnappers. You might want to convince the rest of your team that it's worth rewriting some component, or that a feature you want to build should go into the product. You might want to ask your manager for more responsibility. Perhaps you want a vendor to fix a bug in their software, or a supplier to give you a preferential discount. In any of these cases, you'll need to negotiate. (L looked up the etymology of "negotiate" in the Oxford American Dictionary. Apparently, it comes from the Latin "otium" meaning leisure, so "neg-otium" is "not leisure" or, in other words, business. That's got nothing to do with this book but it's really interesting, so I wanted to share it.)</p>
			<p>A sure-fire way to lose at negotiation is to ignore the other person's position. So, you want time to rewrite that server component in <em class="italics">FluffyMochaGerbilScript</em>, and your manager is saying no. Is that because your manager is a bozo who just doesn't get it? Are you the only person who can see the world as it really is?</p>
			<p>No. That's the fundamental attribution error again (refer <em class="italics">Chapter 12, Business</em>). It's a common enough problem, but if you find yourself thinking that you're talking to an idiot, you're probably just talking to someone with different problems to solve. Perhaps they're worried about a rewrite introducing regressions: what can you do to prove that won't happen? Maybe they know that the company will be taking on some extra work soon, and the time you think you've got for the rewrite doesn't really exist.</p>
			<p>The most reliable way to find out what the other person's concerns are is to ask, because the fundamental attribution error works both ways. While you're thinking that they just don't get clean code or craftsmanship or this week's buzzword, they're thinking that you don't get that this is a business that needs to make money and can't support the whims of a highly-strung developer. One of the two (or more) of you will need to be the one to break the stalemate by sharing what they know and asking what the other person knows. It could be you.</p>
			<p>I find it's easy to get too emotional in the first discussion, particularly when it's a change to a project I've been working on for months and exhaustion has set in. For me, the best thing to do is to take a break, think about how we could meet in the middle, and come back to the discussion later. Just introspecting and wondering what the other person's position is goes some way to reconciliation, but the <strong class="bold">empathy gap</strong>—<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy_gap">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy_gap</a> means that isn't foolproof. I'm likely to assume that the other person is being rational, underestimating the importance of emotional factors in their decision. But wait, I stepped back from the conversation because I was getting <em class="italics">too</em> emotional. It's likely that the other person is making decisions based on visceral factors too.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-219"><a id="_idTextAnchor232"/>Empathy</h2>
			<p>The previous section made it clear that successful negotiation relies largely on <em class="italics">empathy</em>: being able to see what's driving the people you're talking to and identifying how to present your proposed solution in a way that addresses their concerns and satisfies their needs and desires. Let's look in more depth at how that works.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-220"><a id="_idTextAnchor233"/>The Effect of Mood on Collaboration</h3>
			<p>You can probably anecdotally describe the effect that your mood has on how you work with others. I know that when I get grumpy, I value isolation and will bark at people who interrupt me, trying to avoid getting into conversations. This probably means I'm less likely to listen to other opinions and to either contribute meaningfully to discussions or to learn how to do my own job better. I'd rather do the wrong thing on my own than accept help when I'm in that mood.</p>
			<p>In a column called "Mood"—<a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2012/12/157887-moods/fulltext">http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2012/12/157887-moods/fulltext</a> in Communications of the ACM, Peter J. Denning investigates the ways that mood can affect our interactions with each other, even transmitting mood socially between members of a team. He notes that when everybody is positive, collaboration is easy; when everybody is negative, the outcome is likely to be bad so it's best to avoid what will most likely become confrontational.</p>
			<p>It's when people are in mixed moods that outcomes are hardest to predict. Will the negative person or people feed off the optimism of others, or will they resent it? How can you best help to improve the mood of negative people?</p>
			<p>There are some high-level patterns in the overall moods of groups. Bruce Tuckman described four stages of development in the establishment of a team:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Forming</strong>: The team does not exist yet; it is a collection of individuals. Each is seeking acceptance, so the team does not tackle any big or divisive problems. People work independently for the most part.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Storming</strong>: The individual preferences and opinions of each member of the team come into conflict. The team learns what the differences and similarities between its members are, which it is willing to accept, and which cause problems. The group begins to discover where it is willing to be led and how.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Norming</strong>: Through a combination of agreements and compromises, the team decides how to resolve its conflicts, what its goals are, and how it will work towards them.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Performing</strong>: Having collectively agreed upon the team's norms, the members become more efficient at working within the team framework.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can often work out someone's mood by the language they use. An example from Denning's column involves asking team members why they think a recent release of their product was poorly received. One person exhibits a sense of wonder and curiosity:</p>
			<p><em class="italics">...I would love to interview our customers and find out what was behind their reactions. I am certain I will learn something that will help improve our software.</em></p>
			<p>Other shows signs of confusion and resentment:</p>
			<p><em class="italics">I also don't know what the heck is going on. But I do know those customers are jerks...</em></p>
			<p>Language cues can provide information about what mood someone's in, which can inform your choice on how to engage with them.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-221"><a id="_idTextAnchor234"/>Language and Introversion</h3>
			<p>Language also tells you about someone's personality. One scale along which psychologists often grade personalities is how introverted or extroverted someone is. Introverts gain energy from being alone, finding interaction with other people tiring or overwhelming. Extroverts gain energy from being with other people.</p>
			<p>Introverts use more concrete phrases—<a href="http://www.bps-research-digest.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/introverts-use-more-concrete-language.html">http://www.bps-research-digest.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/introverts-use-more-concrete-language.html</a>, and less abstraction, than extroverts. In describing photos of people interacting, introverts were more likely to stick to facts ("the woman is pointing to the right, and has her mouth open"), whereas extroverts were more likely to infer reasons for what the photos depicted ("the woman is angry and is shouting at the man").</p>
			<p>Being able to detect features of someone's personality can go a long way toward empathizing with them, as you can start to predict how they might react to situations or events. Language is a useful tool for this; and one it's easier to get people to engage with than a psychometric test like the Myers-Briggs Type Indicators.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-222"><a id="_idTextAnchor235"/>Knowing What Level to Talk and To Listen At</h3>
			<p>So, extroverts are more likely to use abstract language than introverts, but there are other reasons people may discuss issues at differing levels of abstraction. You need to bear these in mind too, to get the most out of interactions with your team.</p>
			<p>What role does the person you're talking to have? If you're discussing a bug with a fellow coder, then the weird thing you saw where the property was set on the view but then it didn't update because it was reset by a different thread is <em class="italics">totally</em> on topic. It's likely to interest your colleague, they'll have relevant experience to bring to bear, and they'll want to learn what the problem was in case they see a similar thing in the future.</p>
			<p>If you're talking to the business development manager at your client's company, they <em class="italics">may</em> not be so interested. Of course, that's not necessarily true... but it's likely. They're probably more interested in whether the bug has been fixed, when they'll receive the fix, and whether the bug will impact anything else in the product.</p>
			<p>As a courtesy to you, the business development manager probably isn't going to go into the intricacies of their contract with your company and the gnarly clause about how your boss has to fax them a copy of the company's business insurance policy every year. They expect the same courtesy in return. Similarly, your customer wants to hear about why they might want to buy your thing, not about how you completely rewrote it in <em class="italics">SuperFluffyAwesomeSquirrelNode</em>.</p>
			<p>Even in discussions with fellow developers, there are times when the details matter and times when they don't. As we've seen, your colleague's mood can have an effect on their receptiveness: maybe don't go into a discussion about how much better your approach to database retrieval is than theirs when they're feeling apathetic or resigned. </p>
			<p>Situation has as much (or more) of a role to play than personality or emotion, too: if someone's in the exalted "Zone" working on a complex problem, they probably don't want to listen to your opinions on the relative merits of the <strong class="inline">pre-increment</strong> and <strong class="inline">post-increment</strong> operators, fascinating though they may be. (If you actually <em class="italics">have</em> opinions on the relative merits of the <strong class="inline">pre-increment</strong> and <strong class="inline">post-increment</strong> operators and want to share them, please do send them to <strong class="inline">/dev/null</strong>.)</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-223"><a id="_idTextAnchor236"/>Shared Language and Shiny Buzzwords</h2>
			<p>Any social group has its <em class="italics">argot</em> – its special words and phrases that speed up communication between the cognoscenti. (Argot has another meaning: the secret language used by groups to protect their conversations from eavesdropping. In this sense, cants and rhyming slang/back slang are argots. We'll stick with the jargon sense for this book.) Think about what the word "tree" means; now think about what it means in a computer science context. That meaning is part of the argot of computer scientists.</p>
			<p>In a sense, jargon terms define group boundaries because they're exclusive. If you haven't learned the buzzwords in one context, you aren't included in the conversation among people who have. So, while jargon facilitates conversation among those in the know, it also keeps people who aren't in the know from understanding that conversation; it's a cause of inequality and division.</p>
			<p>It's important to realize that, sometimes, subsectors, compani<a id="_idTextAnchor237"/>es, or even teams within companies develop their own slang phrases that are slightly divergent from even the slang used within their industry or sector. One company I worked at used "train" to describe a collection of semi-independent projects that were all due to be released together, where other project managers might use the word "program" instead.</p>
			<p>My first few months working in the telecoms sector involved being bombarded with three letter acronyms (TLAs). When I asked what they meant, people would usually expand the acronym... when I asked what they <em class="italics">meant</em> they'd look at me as if I'd wondered just what these "phone" things we're selling are for. Immersed in the world where your argot is spoken, a new hire will quickly pick up the lingo. A customer or supplier may not have the capacity or desire to do so, however, so may just be confused or misinformed when you use them.</p>
			<p>Confused or misinformed suppliers and customers should be avoided. Suppliers and customers (along with colleagues) should not feel <em class="italics">excluded</em> either, but jargon use can have that effect. If you realize which parts of your language are slang developed in your industry, field, or team, you can know when using them will help discussions and when it will hinder conversation.</p>
