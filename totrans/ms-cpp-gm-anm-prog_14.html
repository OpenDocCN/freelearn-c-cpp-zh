    <p class="normal">In the last part of the book, you will give the inhabitants of your virtual worlds a place to live. You will explore the differences between instance and level data, and you will implement a loader for level data, either found on the internet or created by yourself. You will also learn how collision detection between instances and level geometry is handled, allowing the instances not only to avoid walls but also to walk on the floor of the loaded level. Then, you will be introduced to pathfinding and navigation within the level, enabling the instances to roam around between waypoints in the game map. Finally, you will be presented with a collection of ideas and resources to upgrade the animation editor to a small game engine.</p>
