- en: The Clang compiler is a very complex topic, and some details were omitted in
    the primary chapters of the book. The appendix covers some important aspects of
    Clang and Clang Tools that might be valuable if you are starting to apply this
    knowledge to complex projects containing many files and intricate build rules.

- en: We will begin by discussing how Clang Tools can be integrated into a large project
    that uses complex compilation flags. LLVM serves as one of the examples of such
    projects.

- en: Another important aspect is performance in complex C++ projects. Clang offers
    techniques that can be used to improve build speed for such projects, and we will
    also explore these features.
