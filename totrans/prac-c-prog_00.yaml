- en: This book is on the C programming language and explores all the important elements
    of C, such as strings, arrays (including one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays),
    functions, pointers, file handling, threads, inter-process communication, database
    handling, advanced data structures, graphs, and graphics. As this book takes the
    cookbook approach, the reader will find independent solutions to different problems
    that they usually come across while making applications. By the end of the book,
    the reader will have sufficient knowledge to use high- as well as low-level features
    of the C language and will be able to apply this knowledge to making real-time
    applications.

- en: This book is meant for intermediate to advanced programmers and developers who
    want to make complex and real-time applications in C programming. This book will
    be of great use for trainers, teachers, and software developers who get stuck
    while making applications with arrays, pointers, functions, structures, files,
    databases, inter-process communication, advanced data structures, graphs, and
    graphics, and wish to see a walkthrough example to find the way out of a given
    problem.

- en: '[Chapter 1](8fb53153-2430-4beb-9479-0e79a118ce2b.xhtml), *Working with Arrays*,
    covers some complex but essential operations with arrays. You will learn how to
    insert an element into an array, multiply two matrices, find the common elements
    in two arrays, and also how to find the difference between two sets or arrays.
    Also, you will learn how to find the unique elements in an array and will encounter
    a technique to help you find out whether a given matrix is a sparse matrix or
    not. Lastly, we''ll look at the procedure to merge two sorted arrays into one
    array.'

    teaches you how to manipulate strings to the extent of characters. You will learn
    how to find out whether a given string is a palindrome or not, how to find a given
    occurrence of the first repetitive character in a string, and how to count each
    character in a string. You will also learn how to count vowels and consonants
    in a string and the procedure for converting the vowels in a sentence into uppercase.'

    explores the major role played by functions in breaking down a big application
    into small, independent, and manageable modules. In this chapter, you will learn
    to make a function that finds whether the supplied argument is an Armstrong number
    or not. You will also learn how a function returns an array and will make a function
    that finds the **greatest common divisor** (**gcd**) of two numbers using recursion.
    You will also learn to make functions that convert a binary number into hexadecimal.
    Lastly, you will learn to make a function that determines whether the supplied
    number is a palindrome or not.'

    Compilation*, covers a range of topics, including performing preprocessing and
    compilation, performing conditional compilation with directives, applying assertions
    for validation, catching errors early with compile-time assertions, applying stringize,
    and how to use token-pasting operators.'

    shows you how to use pointers to access content from specific memory locations.
    You will learn how to reverse a string using pointers, how to find the largest
    value in an array using pointers, and the procedure to sort a singly linked list.
    Besides this, the chapter explains how to find the transpose of a matrix using
    pointers and how to access a structure using pointers.'

    at how, when storing data for future use, file handling is very important. In
    this chapter, you will learn to learn to read a text file and convert all the
    characters after a period into uppercase. Also, you will learn how to display
    the content of a random file in reverse order and how to count the number of vowels
    in a text file. The chapter will also show you how to replace a word in a given
    text file with another word, and how to keep your file secure from unauthorized
    access. You will also learn how a file is encrypted.'

    covers how concurrency is implemented in order to increase the efficiency of CPU
    operations. In this chapter, you will learn to do a task using a single thread.
    You will also learn to do multiple tasks with multiple threads and examine the
    technique of sharing data between two threads using mutex. Besides this, you will
    become familiar with situations where deadlock can be created and how such deadlock
    situations can be avoided.'

    will learn how to communicate between processes using pipes, how to establish
    communication among processes using FIFO, and how communication is established
    between the client and server using socket programming. You will also learn to
    do inter-process communication using the UDP socket, how a message is passed from
    one process to another using the message queue, and how the two processes communicate
    using shared memory.'
