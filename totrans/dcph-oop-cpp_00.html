<p>Companies choose to utilize C++ for its speed; however, object-oriented (OO) software design leads to more robust code that is easier to modify and maintain. Understanding how to utilize C++ as an object-oriented language is, therefore, essential. Programming in C++ won’t guarantee object-oriented programming (OOP) – you must understand OO concepts and how they map to C++ language features and programming techniques. Additionally, programmers will want to harness additional skills beyond OOP to make code more generic and robust, as well as employ well-tested, creative solutions that can be found in popular design patterns. It is also critical for programmers to understand language features and conventions that can make C++ a safer language to use.</p>
<p>A programmer who learns how to use C++ as an object-oriented language, following safe programming conventions, will become a valuable C++ developer – a developer whose code is easy to maintain, modify, and be understood by others. </p>
<p>This book has step-by-step explanations of essential OO concepts, paired with practical examples in code and often with diagrams so you can truly understand how and why things work. Self-assessment questions are available to test your skills.</p>
<p>This book first provides necessary building blocks of skills (which may not be object-oriented) that provide the essential foundation on which to build OOP skills. Next, OO concepts will be described and paired with language features as well as coding techniques so that you can understand how to use C++ as an OOP language successfully. Additionally, more advanced skills are added to augment the programmer’s repertoire, including friend function/classes, operator overloading, templates (to build more generic code), exception handling (to build robust code), Standard Template Library (STL) basics, as well as design patterns and idioms. The book wraps up by re-examining programming constructs presented throughout the book, paired with conventions that lead to safer programming in C++. The end goal is to enable you to produce robust code that is easy to maintain and understand by others.</p>
<p>By the end of this book, you will understand both essential and advanced OO concepts and how to implement these concepts in C++. You will have a versatile toolkit of C++ programming skills. You will additionally understand ways to make safer, more robust, and easily maintainable code, as well as understand how to employ well-tested design patterns as part of your programming repertoire.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for?</h1>
<p>Programmers wanting to utilize C++ for OOP will find this book essential to understand how to implement OO designs in C++ through both language features and refined programming techniques, while creating robust and easily maintainable code. This OOP book assumes prior programming experience; however, if you have limited or no prior C++ experience, the early chapters will help you learn essential C++ skills to serve as the basis for the many OOP sections, advanced features, design patterns, and conventions to promote safe programming in C++.</p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-15"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"/>Part 1: C++ Building Block Essentials</h1>
<p>The goal of this part is to ensure that you have a strong background in non-OO C++ skills with which to build the forthcoming OOP skills in C++. This is the shortest section of the book, designed to quickly get you up to speed in preparation for OOP and more advanced book chapters.</p>
<p>The first chapter quickly reviews the basic skills that you are assumed to have to progress through the book: basic language syntax, looping constructs, operators, function usage, user defined type basics (<strong class="source-inline">struct</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">typedef</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">class</strong> basics, <strong class="source-inline">using</strong> statement, <strong class="source-inline">enum</strong>, strongly-typed <strong class="source-inline">enum</strong>), and <strong class="source-inline">namespace</strong> basics. The next chapter discusses <strong class="source-inline">const</strong> qualified variables, function prototyping, prototyping with default values, and function overloading.</p>
<p>The subsequent chapter covers indirect addressing with pointers by introducing <strong class="source-inline">new()</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">delete()</strong> to allocate basic types of data, dynamically allocating arrays of 1, 2, and N dimensions, managing memory with <strong class="source-inline">delete</strong>, passing parameters as arguments to functions, using void pointers, and an overview of smart pointers. This section concludes with a chapter featuring indirect addressing with references that will take you through a review of reference basics, references to existing objects, and as arguments to functions.</p>
<p>Although this book will gradually progress to use smart pointers as a preference (and recommends smart pointers for safety), gaining proficiency with native C++ pointers will be an important skill to have. This skill will be crucial for modifying and deciphering existing code with native pointers, as well as for clearly understanding the potential misuses and pitfalls of native pointers.</p>
